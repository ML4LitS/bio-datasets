Genomic DNA was PCR amplified with primers 515F modified and 926R65 targeting the V4 - V5 regions of microbial 16S rRNA genes using a two - stage targeted amplicon sequencing ( TAS) protocol66.	"515F modified	43	56	primer"	"[{""token"": ""515F modified"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""primer""}]"
PCR amplification of the nifH gene used degenerate universal nifH primers YANNI / 450 and up / down in a nested reaction ( 34), with the second round primers ( up / down) modified to contain common sequence linkers ( 35).	"YANNI / 450	74	85	primer"	"[{""token"": ""YANNI / 450"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""primer""}]"
Each reverse primer ( ITS4) also contained a unique 12 base pair Golay barcode [ 57].	"ITS4	22	26	primer"	"[{""token"": ""ITS4"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""primer""}]"
For 16S rRNA gene amplification for denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis ( DGGE), primers set 1401r / 968GCf was used for bacteria and 515GCr / A109 ( T) f for archaea ( Sousa etal., 2007).

The DGGE profiles of the individual clones were compared with each other and with the DGGE profile of the entire community [ 17]; the profiles were obtained through seminested PCR amplification with the primers Arc344f - mod - GC and 524F - 10 - ext - rv ( 5 - TTA CCG CGG CTG RCA - 3) [ 16].
