In order to clone the mouse homologue of MCOLN1, the human amino acid sequence was compared to the high throughput genomic sequence ( HTGS) database using TBLASTN, which identified the mouse BAC clone RPCI - 23 _ 387H4 ( GB No. AC079544. 1).

While they do have their limitations ( e. g. developmental compensation and strain effects in mouse lines not backcrossed adequately to a parental strain for a minimum of 10 generations), use of our inbred ( N20 generation) animals in the present study ( where no differences in locomotor behavior were detected between D2R - / - and D2R + / + mice; Figs. 1 & 2) revealed a previously unappreciated role of D2R - mediated signaling in associative learning and attention that could not be measured with the currently available, acutely administered D2R antagonists.

Although the analysis of T. rubripes, rodents and humans so far suggests that the vertebrate TACC3 precursor was not included in the second round of genomic duplication, it could not be excluded that a TACC4 gene may have been lost during the evolution of these lineages.

The failure to observe a truly null ATRX allele among human patients strongly suggests that, as in the mouse, the complete absence of ATRX protein is incompatible with human fetal survival.

Of interest are the phenotypic similarities and differences between our KA mutant mice and the previously described K14 - Delta N87 beta cat transgenic mice expressing stable beta - catenin under the control of K14 promoter [ 25] and K14 - Lef1 transgenic mice [ 27].

Surprisingly, our mutant mice shared more similarities with the K14 - Lef1 mice than the K14 - Delta N87 beta cat transgenic mice.

In addition, KA mutant mice displayed a disorganized hair coat beginning with the emergence of neonatal hairs, similar to that observed in K14 - Lef1 mice, whereas in K14 - Delta N87 beta cat mice, embryonic hair follicle morphogenesis was unaffected and other skin changes only emerged postnatally.

By crossing the heterozygous mice to FLPe deleter mice [ 34], PGKneor cassette was deleted in the germline by FRT - mediated recombination to generate mice with the final ApcCKO allele.

ApcCKO heterozygote mice were crossed with Cre deleter mice, EIIA - cre transgenic mice that express Cre in early embryo [ 35], to knockout the Apc allele in the germline, consequently creating a knockout strain ( Figure 1A).

The mice analyzed in this study were generated by crossing ApcCKO heterozygote mice of the F1 generation ( C57BL / 6J x 129 / S background) with K14 - cre transgenic mice ( FVB background).

Given our interest in human neurological disease we sought to identify any cognate human disorders where linkage had been established to the syntenic region of the human genome, but where no causal mutation had been identified.

First, the disease may be a result of haploinsufficiency at ITPR1; this concept is consistent with the observation that heterozygous deletion leads to a later onset disorder in humans, whereas homozygous deletion in mice leads to an early onset disorder, able to be expressed within the much shorter life span of the mouse.

Currently, the small number of aged Itpr1wt / Delta 18 animals precludes us from examining these mice for subtle signs and symptoms similar to those seen in SCA15 patients; however, these mice are clearly of interest to us as a potential model of SCA15.

( G) Western blot performed to examine Itpr1 levels in whole brain from wild - type, Itpr1wt / Delta 18, and Itpr1 Delta 18 / Delta 18 mice; this clearly shows a reduction of Itpr1 in brain tissue from Itpr1wt / Delta 18 mice and a greater reduction of Itpr1 in Itpr1 Delta 18 / Delta 18 mice.
