Notably, A. thaliana does not appear to have a meiotic checkpoint activity that eliminates mutant meiocytes in a manner analogous to organisms such as mice, budding yeast, and female Drosophila [ 11, 57], and mammalian TRIP13 is more similar to Arabidopsis PCH2 than the fly or worm proteins ( Figures 1A and S1).
