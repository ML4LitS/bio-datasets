It is the first time to report the existence of multiple Acdp genes in other mammals in addition to human, while Acdp appears to be a single copy gene in lower organisms such as in C. elegans, yeasts and bacteria.

The best studied of these genes, Dmrt1, is expressed in the differentiating male genital ridges and adult testis of mammals, birds, fish, and reptiles, and a recently duplicated Dmrt1 gene functions as the Y - linked testis - determining gene in the Medaka fish [ 25 - 29].

Strikingly, Dmrt7 is present, not only in placental mammals, but also in marsupials and a monotreme ( egg - laying mammal), the platypus, which has a clear Dmrt7 ortholog [ 36].
