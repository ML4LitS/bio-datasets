Hematopoiesis in vertebrates, from zebrafish to humans, is an evolutionarily conserved program that produces two waves of stem or progenitor cells that differ both in their embryonic origins and in the lineages of differentiated blood cells produced ( Palis and Yoder 2001; Orkin and Zon 2002; Galloway and Zon 2003).

The coding sequence of mon is most similar to human TIF gamma ( Le Douarin et al. 1995; Friedman et al. 1996; Venturini et al. 1999), and the locations of exon boundaries are conserved between the zebrafish and human genes ( unpublished data).

Furthermore, whereas XpdTTD / TTD mice developed kyphosis earlier than wt animals ( onset ~ 3 mo versus 12 - 20 mo), compound heterozygous XpdTTD / + XPCS mice did not ( Figure 3B).

Secondly, highlighting the potential relevance of current findings to all diploid organisms including humans was the observation that in one compound heterozygous animal, the Xpd allelic relationship could shift from Adominant | arecessive to Arecessive | adominant with respect to different phenotypes in a time - dependent and tissue - specific manner ( see below and Table 2).

PAI - 1 antigen concentration was determined by ELISA [ 21] using sheep - anti mouse PAI - 1 ( American Diagnostica) as the capture antibody and mouse PAI - 1 ( American Diagnostica) as the standard ( 0 - 3. 5 ng / mL).

In order to determine if specific pathways were altered in the B6 and A / J strains, mice with known alterations in hemostasis, Lepob mice, or thrombosis, Plg - / - and PAI - / - mice, were also tested.

Rebleeding time was not different in Plg - / - mice compared to WT littermates, but PAI - 1 - / - mice had a significantly ( P < 0. 05) reduced rebleeding time, which was 1. 8 - fold lower than for the B6 mice.

The density of the Western blot from SDS - PAGE under reducing conditions of plasma of varying volumes from B6 and A / J mice was compared and the density of the bands was 56% higher in the A / J than the B6 mice ( six individual mice were tested on at least two occasions) from the same amount of plasma ( Fig. 1B).

Thus, the concentration of Plg in plasma from the A / J mice was higher than plasma from the B6 mice as determined by two methods and no difference in migration after electrophoresis was observed, suggesting no marked changes in the structure of Plg in the two mouse strains.

Rebleeding time in the parent strains and CSS were compared to values from the progeny of mice that were crossed with B6 mice to produce heterosomic mice for the CSS - 5, ( B6xCSS - 5) F1 and CSS - 17 ( B6xCSS - 17) F1 strains ( Figure 5).

In CSS - 17 mice, the Plg antigen was also significantly ( P = 0. 015) increased ( 152 +/- 6, n = 12) when compared to the B6 mice, but for CSS - 5 and CSS - 5 x 17, the Plg antigen was similar to values for the B6 mice.

alpha 2 - antiplasmin was significantly ( P = < 0. 01) reduced in CSS - 5 mice ( 142 +/- 4 mu g / mL, n = 5), significantly ( P < 0. 05) higher in the CSS - 11 ( 201 +/- 6, n = 8), but not different in CSS - 17 or CSS - 5 x 17 mice compared to the B6 mice.

In the mice with deficiencies of the Plg network [ 27], thrombus formation time was reduced in the Plg - / - mice, but increased in the PAI - / - mice, suggesting that alterations in plasmin activity that affect the rate of clot lysis, can modulate the events leading to occlusive thrombus formation.

In our study, Plg - / - mice had increased bleeding time, PAI - 1 - / - had decreased rebleeding time, and uPA - / - mice had an increased bleeding time similar to the Plg - / - mice ( J.

Blood pressure was measured in the Plg - / - mice ( D. Hellard, J. Hoover - Plow, and E.
