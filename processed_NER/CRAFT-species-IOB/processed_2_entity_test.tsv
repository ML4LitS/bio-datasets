This was supported by the morphological observation made in this study of no posterior sutures or fiber cells extending to the posterior capsule of the lens, ectopically staining nucleic acids in the posterior subcapsular region of 5 wk and anterior subcapsular cortex of 54 wk, gross morphological differences in the equatorial / bow, posterior and anterior regions of lenses from alphaA / BKO mice as compared to wild mice.

However, a few comparatively minor modifications can bring the zebrafish sequence into good agreement with that of the fugu CLN2.

Corrected gene sequence of the zebrafish CLN2. This putative sequence shows the manual corrections that bring it into alignment with the sequence of the fugu enzyme.

The available amino acid sequence of the fugu CLN2 analog, named by us sedolisin - TPP [ 8], is also in good agreement with the sequences of the mammalian orthologs ( Figure 3).	"fugu	41	45	Organism"	"mammalian	145	154	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""fugu"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mammalian"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The only major difference in the translated amino acid sequence compared to the mammalian and zebrafish enzymes is in the amino terminus of the propeptide region that is shorter by 30 amino acids ( not shown).

However, the sequenced part of the enzyme shows 75% identity with the fugu sedolisin - TPP, and 69% identity with human CLN2 ( Figure 3).

That this bond likely occurs in the real protein is suggested by the fact that these two cysteines are strictly conserved in all known animal species of CLN2 ( Figures 1 and 3), although they are absent in all known sequences of bacterial sedolisins.

It has been recently reported that kumamolisin, and particularly a closely related protein from Alicyclobacillus sendaiensis ( kumamolisin - As) can efficiently cleave not only collagen - related peptides, but also native type I collagen [ 23].

We report that mon encodes the zebrafish ortholog of mammalian transcriptional intermediary factor 1 gamma ( TIF1 gamma) ( or TRIM33), a member of the TIF1 family of coactivators and corepressors.

Positional cloning identifies the mon gene as the zebrafish ortholog of mammalian transcriptional intermediary factor 1 gamma ( TIF1 gamma), a member of the TIF1 family of transcriptional coactivators and corepressors ( Le Douarin et al. 1995; Friedman et al. 1996; Kim et al. 1996; Venturini et al. 1999; Peng et al. 2002).

The murine Tif1 alpha and Tif1 gamma genes have not yet been subjected to gene targeting experiments, whereas analysis of mouse mutants demonstrates that Tif1 beta is required for postimplantation embryogenesis and mesoderm induction in particular ( Cammas et al. 2000).

The end sequences and SSCP markers of PAC 107N19 are found in the zebrafish genomic sequence contig ctg23107 ( http: / / www. ensembl. org / Danio _ rerio /) containing a predicted zebrafish TIF1 family gene.

Therefore, based on sequence similarity and chromosomal location, the zebrafish mon gene is the likely ortholog of the human TIF1 gamma gene.	"zebrafish	70	79	Organism"	"human	119	124	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""zebrafish"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We also compared the expression of zebrafish mon to mouse Tif1 gamma ( Figure 4A and 4B).

Taken together these results strongly suggest that zebrafish mon and mouse Tif1 gamma are orthologs that function during hematopoiesis.

Given that mammalian TIF1 gamma has been shown to form hetero - oligomers with Tif1 alpha ( Peng et al. 2002), we searched for additional TIF1 family members in zebrafish to compare with tif1 gamma.

Like mammalian TIF1 alpha ( Le Douarin et al. 1995; Niederreither et al. 1999), the predicted zebrafish tif1 gamma gene is broadly expressed ( see Figure 4A).

Our results strongly support the conclusion that we have positionally cloned the zebrafish mon gene correctly, and it is the ortholog of mammalian Tif1 gamma.

In addition, tif1 gamma / Tif1 gamma is highly expressed in hematopoietic cells throughout embryogenesis in both zebrafish and mouse ( see Figure 4).

Comparing available zebrafish and mammalian TIF1 - predicted amino acid sequences, it appears that the Tif1 gamma orthologs are the most highly conserved family members while the Tif1 alpha sequences are relatively more divergent.

We have not found a Tif1 beta ortholog, thus far, in the zebrafish or fugu genome or EST sequences.

However, hybrid strains between 129 and C57BL / 6 mice, widely used in the generation of gene - targeted mice, develop spontaneous autoimmunity.

Genetic predisposition is an important contributor to susceptibility to SLE in both humans and animals ( Vyse and Todd 1996; Harley et al. 1998; Theofilopoulos and Kono 1999; Wakeland et al. 2001).	"humans	84	90	Organism"	"animals	95	102	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""humans"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In this regard, it is of note that hybrid strains between 129 and C57BL / 6 mice, widely used in the generation of gene - targeted mice, are spontaneously predisposed to development of humoral autoimmunity with low levels of glomerulonephritis ( Obata et al. 1979; Botto et al. 1998; Bickerstaff et al. 1999; Santiago - Raber et al. 2001).	"mice	76	80	Organism"	"mice	131	135	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These observations led to the hypothesis that the autoimmune phenotype described in some gene - targeted mice might be due primarily to combinations of as - yet - uncharacterised background genes, originating from 129 and C57BL / 6 mice strains, interacting or not with the mutated allele.	"mice	105	109	Organism"	"mice	232	236	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 232, ""end_span"": 236, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The Apcs - deficient mice ( Apcs - / -) were chosen as an example of a gene - targeted strain previously reported to develop a lupus - like disease on the hybrid genetic background ( 129 x C57BL / 6); autoimmunity in Apcs - / - mice persists even after backcrossing the mutated gene onto C57BL / 6 ( Bickerstaff et al. 1999).	"mice	21	25	Organism"	"mice	228	232	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 228, ""end_span"": 232, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
To investigate the genetic basis of the lupus - like disease observed in the ( 129 x C57BL / 6) hybrid mice, we generated two large cohorts of ( 129 x C57BL / 6) F2 animals, one carrying a mutation in the Apcs gene, and monitored them for 1 y under identical environmental conditions.	"mice	103	107	Organism"	"animals	165	172	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 172, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Since female mice in the original reports showed a higher penetrance of disease, the present study was conducted only on female mice.

We compared the levels of these auto - Abs between all ( 129 x C57BL / 6) F2. Apcs - / - mice and a group of 33 wild - type mice that were selected for being homozygous 129 in the region of Chromosome 1 between microsatellites D1Mit105 and D1Mit 223 ( 80 - 106 cM) ( Figure 6A - 6D).

Consistent with this explanation, we found that the 129 mice have significantly higher levels of Apcs in circulation compared with the C57BL / 6 mice ( median, 83 mg / l; range, 25 - 208; n = 16 versus median, 5 mg / l; range, 4 - 9; n = 10, respectively; p < 0. 0001).

In contrast to these strong associations with disease serological markers, the QTL analysis identified only two potential linkages to glomerulonephritis: one in the wild - type mice on Chromosome 7 across a 10 cM region between D7Mit246 ( 15 cM) and D7Mit145 ( 26. 5 cM) of 129 origin ( LOD 2. 86, p = 0. 0013), and one on Chromosome 17 between D17Mit100 ( 11. 7 cM) and D17Mit216 ( 29. 4 cM) from the C57BL / 6 strain ( LOD 1. 3, p = 0. 049 and LOD 1. 67, p = 0. 021 in the wild - type and Apcs - / - mice, respectively).

At the end of the backcrossing, the 129 - derived Chromosome 1 interval in the congenic mice extended from microsatellite marker D1Mit105 to D1Mit223 ( 80 - 106 cM), which encompasses the most important 129 interval identified by the linkage studies in the ( C57BL / 6 x 129 / Sv) F2 mice.

Female Chromosome 1 congenic mice ( C57BL / 6. 129 [ D1Mit105 - 223]), together with sex - matched Apcs - / - mice backcrossed onto C57BL / 6 for ten generations ( C57BL / 6.

However, the C57BL / 6. 129 ( D1Mit105 - 223) animals also expressed high levels of auto - Abs, and these titres were not different from those detected in the matched congenic mice containing a null mutation of the Apcs gene.

Taken together our results suggest a complex genetic contribution from the ( 129 x C57BL / 6) hybrid background genome, with both enhancing as well as inhibitory loci from the 129 mouse, in addition to genes promoting autoimmunity from the C57BL / 6 mice.

The impact that these interacting loci may have on the lupus - like disease present in several gene - targeted animals was further assessed by comparing Apcs - / - mice with Chromosome 1 genetically matched controls.

In this context, it is of note that several strains of mice with targeted mutations of genes encoded in this region have been reported to express a lupus - like illness, including mice lacking Fc gamma RIIB ( Bolland and Ravetch 2000), complement receptors ( CR1 / 2) ( Prodeus et al. 1998; Wu et al. 2002), and decay - accelerating factor ( CD55) ( Miwa et al. 2002).

However, as the congenic mice and the Apcs - / - mice carried similar but not identical 129 regions on Chromosome 1, an alternative explanation for our findings may still lay in the numerous and complex synergistic and counteractive interactions between 129 and C57BL / 6 genes involved in self - tolerance and end organ damage.

Detailed genetic studies in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans have recently yielded evidence that basic phagocytic mechanisms and pathways for the recognition and engulfment of apoptotic cells are highly conserved throughout phylogeny [ 7, 8].

Close examination of retinal structures revealed that the inner granular layer was still less expanded in Ptdsr - deficient animals, however, and that it contained fewer cells and was still severely underdeveloped in comparison with the corresponding retinal layer in control animals ( Figure 4c, 4g and 4d, 4h).

In summary, we observed a wide range of ocular malformations in Ptdsr - deficient mice that ranged from differentiation defects in retinal cell layers ( for example, the inner granular layer) in mildly affected homozygotes to anophthalmia in severely affected Ptdsr - / - mice that was associated with induction of ectopic eye structures in nasal cavities.

Moreover, because Li and colleagues [ 31] reported impaired clearance of dead cells during lung development in Ptdsr - deficient mice, we examined the rate of apoptosis induction and cell clearance in our Ptdsr - knockout mice in the lung.

We do not think that the different results observed in Ptdsr - knockout mice in a mixed C57BL / 6 x 129 background and in a pure C57BL / 6J background can be attributed to genetic background effects: comparison of apoptotic cell engulfment efficacies of thioglycollate - elicited macrophages from 129P2 / OlaHsd and C57BL / 6J mice did not show any differences in apoptotic cell uptake ( J.

While the fraction of animals with broader recombination patterns must be tracked and accounted for during experiments, these animals offer the potential benefit of revealing additional new functions of target genes that could be subsequently studied with additional site - specific Cre drivers.

Gdf5 - Cre transgenic mice were bred to animals carrying a conditional floxed allele of the Bmpr1a locus ( Mishina et al. 2002), usually in the presence of the R26R reporter allele to facilitate simultaneous visualization of Cre - mediated recombination patterns ( see typical cross in Figure 3).

Consistent with this notion, the processivity of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe and mouse Mcm4 / 6 / 7 complexes is significantly stimulated on forked DNA structures and it can unwind duplex DNA of 400 - 500 bp ( 13, 14).

The ability of the mouse Mcm4 / 6 / 7 to unwind 3 ' - extension is shared by the archaeal Mcm helicase but not by Mcm4 / 6 / 7 from S. pombe and S. cerevisiae ( 14, 26, 27).

Occurrence of AT - rich sequences, with asymmetric distribution of adenine and thymine, near the replication origins, lead us to propose that Mcm may play a role in selection of initiation sites of mammalian DNA replication, and prompted us to examine the ability of sequences from human replication origins to activate Mcm4 / 6 / 7 helicase.

Inactivation of the mouse HD gene ( Hdh) has shown that huntingtin is not required for cell viability, as evidenced by the survival of mouse embryonic stem cells and neurons that lack huntingtin [ 10 - 12].

Through forward genetic screening of ethylnitrosourea - mutagenized mice, we report the identification and characterization of a mouse model of NDI, with an F204V mutation in the Aqp2 gene.

Using these animals, we have directly proven this hypothesis of improper AQP2 translocation as the molecular defect in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in the intact organism.

Together these models suggest that the mouse may be a highly sensitive organism with regard to water homeostasis, and is unable to survive with polyuria.

In a forward genetic screen that used ethylnitrosourea ( ENU) to induce mutations in a founder animal whose offspring were then screened for abnormal whole body metabolism [ 19, 20], we found a family of mice that urinated and drank excessively.

Basal urine concentration in mutant mice is about 161 mOsm, compared to about 1, 293 mOsm in wild - type mice ( p < 0. 001).

With similar treatment, mutant mice concentrate their urine to a lesser but still significant extent, from 161 to 470 mOsm ( 2. 9 - fold), indicating that these animals are not only unable to concentrate their urine properly but are also defective in their response to dDAVP.

The smaller response to dDAVP indicates some residual activity of the mutant AQP2 channel, which must be sufficient to allow survival of the individual, in contrast to the T126M knock - in mouse [ 18].

Other than the increased urine production and water intake, there was no overt phenotype in mutant mice, save distended kidneys, which appeared variably in adult animals ( Figure 2A).

We found distended kidneys in all Aqp2F204V / F204V mice; however, the degree of inflation was variable in affected mice and worsened with age.

Compared to that from the kidneys of wild - type animals, AQP2 from mutant animals was reduced in both the high molecular weight, diffuse form and the lowest molecular weight form, but enriched in the intermediate molecular weight form ( Figure 3A).

The presence of some mature glycosylated proteins ( 35 - 45 kDa) in Aqp2F204V / F204V mice presumably permits their survival compared to Aqp2T126M / T126M mice, and is consistent with a diminished response to dDAVP.

GluR - B Delta ECS: FB mice had, in contrast to mice expressing GluR - B ( Q) globally, a prolonged lifespan and no severe developmental alterations.

Whereas control mice reliably responded only to the previously rewarded odor ( memory of 86 +/- 8%, mean +/- SD, n = 9, Figure 2E), GluR - B Delta FB mice showed reduced olfactory memory ( 69 +/- 16%, n = 9, p < 0. 05, Mann - Whitney).

While the improved odor discrimination and learning behavior showed only little variability, the significantly impaired memory performance observed in GluR - B Delta FB mice was highly variable among individual animals compared with control littermates ( Figure 2E).

This variability in olfactory memory was reflected in the level and extent of Cre - recombinase expression in forebrain of transgenic TgCre4 mice, as visualized by Cre - activity in the Cre - indicator mouse line R26R.

Notably, mice with pronounced memory deficits ( memory < 70%) showed essentially no detectable GluR - B protein in hippocampus, amygdala, olfactory bulb, and piriform cortex ( n = 2, Figure 4B, and unpublished data), but mice with almost complete memory displayed substantial residual GluR - B levels in all brain areas investigated ( n = 2, Figure 4B, and unpublished data).

To quantify the relation between residual GluR - B protein and olfactory memory, the memory experiment was repeated with nine additional GluR - B Delta FB mice and two GluR - B2lox control animals ( indicated with shaded symbols in Figure 4A), resulting in the same mean, variability, and range of memory performance ( control: 89 +/- 10%; GluR - B Delta FB: 63 +/- 14%).

The mouse line employed for this purpose, termed GluR - BRescue, had the genetic background of GluR - B Delta FB mice but additionally carried a bidirectional module for beta - galactosidase and GFPGluR - B expression, responsive to the tetracycline - controlled transcriptional transactivator [ 62].

Importantly, olfactory memory in GluR - BRescue mice was intermediate ( 75 +/- 15%, n = 8), below GluR - B2lox control levels, but better than in GluR - B Delta FB mice.	"mice	48	52	Organism"	"mice	164	168	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 168, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We employed gene - targeted and transgenic mice with region - specific expression to demonstrate that a change in GluR - B - mediated properties of AMPA channels in alpha CaMKII - expressing neurons of mouse forebrain, including olfactory bulb mitral and granule cells, enhances olfactory discrimination and learning but impairs olfactory memory.	"mice	43	47	Organism"	"mouse	202	207	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 202, ""end_span"": 207, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
A direct contribution to the phenotype by Ca2 + influx through genetically modified AMPA channels seems to be likely, since mice expressing Q / R site - unedited GluR - B showed even better odor learning and discrimination performance compared with mice with depleted GluR - B.

It will be interesting to see if GluR - B + / neo mice also exhibit enhanced odor discrimination, which is indeed likely given that low levels of GluR - B ( Q), and hence a small increase in Ca2 + - permeable AMPARs, arise from the attenuated GluR - Bneo allele [ 60], and, moreover, that GluR - B levels are decreased in these mice due to the single copy of the GluR - B + allele.

In a second approach, the gene expression profile in livers of the above mentioned mice was compared by Affymetrix GeneChip (R) Mouse Genome 430 2. 0 Arrays ( Table 1).

Ndrg1 was significantly downregulated in microarrays of liver transcripts from cadmium - treated Mtf1Mx - cre mice compared to similarly treated Mtf1loxP control mice ( Table 1, c).

Ndrg1 probably has some role in stress response since various stimuli, including hypoxia and nickel compounds, activate expression of rodent Ndrg1 and / or its human ortholog ( 37 - 40).

Csrp1 was found in microarray analyses to be significantly downregulated in cadmium - treated Mtf1Mx - cre mice compared to Mtf1loxP mice ( Table 1, c).

Slc39a10 was detected in microarray analysis to be significantly upregulated in livers from both mock - and cadmium - treated Mtf1Mx - cre mice compared to control animals ( Table 1, b and d).

Finally, we also identified a number of cadmium - responsive genes that were independent of MTF - 1 presence, by comparing the probe array data of all cadmium - treated mice with the data of all mock - treated mice, irrespective of the genotype ( Table 2).

In this study, a virtually complete deletion of Mtf1 in the liver of adult, pI - pC - induced Mtf1Mx - cre mice did not detectably affect the phenotype of the respective mice under non - stress conditions, confirming that MTF - 1 is dispensable in the adult liver ( 26), in contrast to its essential role in embryonic liver development ( 23).

Assuming that CSRP1 is important for the organization of cytoskeletal elements in the mouse, its upregulation by cadmium might protect the organism from damage of the cytoskeleton.

We have identified and preliminarily characterized four target genes of MTF - 1 in the adult mouse liver: in the case of Sepw1, MTF - 1 is required to maintain basal expression, supporting a role of mouse MTF - 1 in oxidative stress response.

We previously reported a set of antioxidant genes for which transcript abundance was lower in normal bronchial epithelial cells ( NBEC) of BC individuals compared to non - BC individuals.

From these data, we hypothesized that antioxidant and DNA repair genes are co - regulated by one or more transcription factors and that inter - individual variation in expression and / or function of one or more of these transcription factors is responsible for inter - individual variation in risk for BC.	"individual	144	154	Organism"	"individual	270	280	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""individual"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""individual"", ""start_span"": 270, ""end_span"": 280, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
CEBPG transcription factor was significantly ( p < 0. 01) correlated with eight of the antioxidant or DNA repair genes in non - BC individuals but not in BC individuals.

In BC individuals the correlation with CEBPG was significantly ( p < 0. 01) lower than that of non - BC individuals for four of the genes ( XRCC1, ERCC5, GSTP1, and SOD1) and the difference was nearly significant for GPX1.	"individuals	6	17	Organism"	"individuals	104	115	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""individuals"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""individuals"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In that study, there was a tendency towards correlation in transcript abundance between several pairs of antioxidant or DNA repair genes in non - BC individuals, but not in BC individuals.

Based on the above findings, it was hypothesized first, that there is inter - individual variation in regulation of key antioxidant and DNA repair genes by one or more transcription factors and second, that individuals with sub - optimal regulation are selected for development of BC if they smoke cigarettes.

For XRCC1, ERCC5, GSTP1, and SOD1 the correlation with CEBPG was significantly lower in BC individuals compared to non - BC individuals and the difference was nearly significant for GPX1 ( Fig. 1b).

Scatter plots of the relationship between CEBPG and XRCC1 in non - BC individuals or BC individuals ( Fig. 2a, b) are representative of the other four genes.

Neither CEBPG, nor XRCC1, ERCC5, GSTP1, SOD1 or GPX1 was significantly correlated with age, gender, or smoking history in non - BC individuals, BC individuals, or the combined group.	"individuals	131	142	Organism"	"individuals	147	158	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""individuals"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""individuals"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
For example, when samples from all 49 non - BC individuals and BC individuals were assessed as a single group, E2F1 was significantly correlated with ERCC5, GSTP1 and SOD1 ( Table 4).	"individuals	47	58	Organism"	"individuals	66	77	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""individuals"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""individuals"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Further, in non - BC individuals, E2F1 was correlated with GSTP1 ( Fig. 1c) and the correlation was lower in BC individuals.	"individuals	21	32	Organism"	"individuals	112	123	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""individuals"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""individuals"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, the difference in correlation between non - BC individuals and BC individuals was not significant.

For example, the non - BC individual and BC individual groups are not perfectly matched with respect to age, gender or smoking history ( Table 1) and each of these factors could contribute to the observed difference in correlation between groups.

Another possible explanation is that any differences in NBEC from BC individuals compared to non - BC individuals resulted from development of BC, instead of being a hereditary cause of increased risk for cancer.	"individuals	69	80	Organism"	"individuals	102	113	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""individuals"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""individuals"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Among the matched heaviest smokers, it is expected that CEBPG will be significantly correlated with each of the antioxidant or DNA repair genes among the non - BC individuals but not correlated in BC individuals.	"individuals	163	174	Organism"	"individuals	200	211	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""individuals"", ""start_span"": 163, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""individuals"", ""start_span"": 200, ""end_span"": 211, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This, in turn, leads to increased representation among BC individuals of individuals with lack of correlation between CEBPG and each of the affected antioxidant and / or DNA repair genes.

In this study, E2F1 correlation with DNA repair and antioxidant genes was less than the correlation observed with CEBPG, and the E2F1 correlation was observed in both non - BC individuals as well as BC individuals.

Importantly, the total amount of APP ( endogenous plus transgenic) and related APLPs in both acute and chronically treated animals was statistically indistinguishable from that in nontransgenic mice ( Figure 1D; statistical analyses for experiments throughout the study are presented in the accompanying figure legends).

Indeed, animals that were born and raised on dox did not harbor this reservoir of treatment - resistant peptide, with 96. 3% less A beta 42 than untreated 4 - wk - old mice.

Unlike what is thought to occur in the human disease, the first visible plaques in the tet - off APP mice are fibrillar - cored deposits.

To confirm that the arrest of plaques without any sign of clearance was not unique to the line 107 mice, we repeated the dox - suppression experiment in a second line of tet - off APP mice ( CaMKII alpha - tTA x tet - APPswe / ind line 18; n = 22).	"mice	99	103	Organism"	"mice	184	188	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 184, ""end_span"": 188, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
As in the line 107 mice described above, amyloid burden worsened substantially in the untreated mice between 6 and 9 mo of age.

We biochemically measured the amount of aggregated A beta in the brains of our mice before and after transgene suppression using filter trap analysis of cortical tissue from each animal.

Filter trap analysis of line 18 tTA / APP mice yielded similar results: the increase in aggregated A beta observed in untreated animals between 6 and 9 mo of age was completely arrested by transgene suppression ( Figure S5C and S5D).	"mice	42	46	Organism"	"animals	128	135	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In fact, levels of PBS - soluble A beta 40 and A beta 42 in the 6 mo + 3 mo and 6 mo + 6 mo treated cohorts were most similar to that of the 9 mo untreated cohort, suggesting that age, as opposed to synthetic rate ( which would be negligible in the treated animals), may determine the fraction of PBS - soluble A beta in these animals.	"animals	257	264	Organism"	"animals	327	334	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 257, ""end_span"": 264, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 327, ""end_span"": 334, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The tTA / APP animals were often seen running in circles around the perimeter of their cages, and a similar swimming pattern was noted when the mice were tested in the Morris water maze.

Other studies have dealt with similar problems by excluding animals that do not show adequate attention to the task, retaining only those mice that meet certain performance criteria [ 30].

However, in the current study, we feel that although the poor performance of the tTA / APP mice in the maze tests could technically be scored as cognitive impairment, the animals ' severe hyperactivity made interpretation of the cognitive tasks impossible.

In order to understand the nature and extent of hyperactivity in the tTA / APP mice, we quantified daily activity levels in double transgenic animals along with their single transgenic and nontransgenic siblings using four - beam frames designed to monitor ambulation within an enclosed cage.

In interpreting our study, it should be remembered that the earliest plaques to appear in these mice, like other APP transgenics harboring the Swedish mutation [ 27], are predominantly fibrillar deposits, which may be less tractable than the diffuse aggregates thought to come first in the course of the human disease.

It is possible that the combined low levels of endogenous mouse A beta and nonsuppressed human peptide are sufficient to maintain existing deposits.

In our opinion, it seems unlikely that amyloid deposits in human brain would be inherently any less stable than those formed in mouse brain.

However, the human brain may harbor clearance mechanisms not shared by mice that would allow more efficient removal of preexisting amyloid.

One potential mechanism by which amyloid may be more efficiently removed in the human disease than in the mouse models is through microglial phagocytosis.

Somewhat paradoxically, several studies further demonstrate that treatment with anti - inflammatory drugs to reduce microglial activation actually lowers amyloid load in APP transgenic mice, suggesting a role for mouse microglia in the formation and maintenance of amyloid aggregates [ 41 - 43].

Given the relatively minor role played by microglia in other mouse models of amyloidosis, we think it unlikely that these cells have influenced the rate of amyloid clearance in the tet - off APP mice.

Similar to hemizygous TTD mice carrying one true Xpd knockout allele ( XpdTTD / KO), compound heterozygous XpdTTD / + XPCS mice were born at the expected Mendelian frequencies.

Despite reduced levels of mRNA expression, the homozygous lethal Xpd + XPCS allele ameliorated multiple XpdTTD - associated disease symptoms in compound heterozygous XpdTTD / + XPCS animals including the hallmark brittle hair and cutaneous features fully penetrant in homo - and hemizygous TTD mice ( Figure 2A - 2C).

In marked contrast to XpdTTD / TTD ( and XpdTTD / KO) mice, which display complete hair loss in the first hair cycle and partial hair loss in subsequent cycles throughout their lives [ 21], compound heterozygous XpdTTD / + XPCS mice displayed some hair loss only during the first hair cycle and only locally at the back ( Figure 2A).

Amino acid analysis confirmed that cysteine levels in the hair of the XpdTTD / + XPCS mice were significantly higher than in XpdTTD / TTD animals, but remained below the wt level ( Figure 2C).

Furthermore, anaemia and developmental delay present in patients with TTD [ 24] and in XpdTTD / TTD mice [ 15] were both partially rescued in compound heterozygous XpdTTD / + XPCS mice ( Figure 2D and 2E).

Because patients with TTD, XPCS, and CS ( but not XP) and the corresponding mouse models share similar accelerated progeroid symptoms [ 12, 13, 15, 23], we next addressed ageing - related parameters in compound heterozygous mice ( Figure 3).

Whereas XpdTTD / TTD animals show reduced bone mineral density as an indication of the early onset of osteoporosis before ~ 14 mo of age [ 15], tail vertebrae from compound heterozygous XpdTTD / + XPCS mice were comparable to wt even at 20 mo of age ( Figure 3B and 3C).

Note the extreme cachexia ( lack of subcutaneous fat) in the XpdTTD / TTD mouse and the absence of this phenotype in wt and XpdTTD / + XPCS mice.

To determine whether the homozygous lethal Xpd + XPCS allele was unique in its ability to ameliorate symptoms associated with the XpdTTD allele, we generated compound heterozygous XpdTTD / + XP mice by crossing the corresponding heterozygous animals.	"mice	194	198	Organism"	"animals	242	249	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 194, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 242, ""end_span"": 249, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, unlike the in vivo TTD phenotypes described above, in which XpdTTD / TTD and XpdTTD / KO animals were indistinguishable, XpdTTD dosage effects were observed in UV survival, UV - UDS, and UV - RRS, indicating that cellular parameters as measured in fibroblasts here do not always correlate with the phenotype at the level of the intact organism.

However, homozygous XPDXP ( XPDR683W) and hemizygous XPDXPCS ( XPDG602D) human cells are known to be highly sensitive to UV [ 19, 25], as are cells from a homozygous viable XpdXPCS / XPCS ( XPDG602D / G602D) mouse model ( Figure 4A, dotted line) [ 23].

Despite overexpression of mRNA from the XpdTTD allele relative to the wt allele ( Figure 1E), TFIIH protein levels were reduced by 50% in primary mouse XpdTTD / TTD fibroblasts ( Figure 4E and 4F), thereby mimicking the situation in human patients with TTD.	"mouse	146	151	Organism"	"human	233	238	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 233, ""end_span"": 238, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Notably, XpdTTD / + XPCS animals had a partial TTD hair phenotype, correlating with low levels of Xpd + XPCS expression, whereas XpdTTD / XPCS animals had wt hair, correlating with normal expression levels from the viable XpdXPCS allele ( Table 2 and unpublished data).

Our data suggest that certain presumed null alleles, although unable on their own to support basal transcription, may in fact have a substantial impact on disease outcome in compound heterozygous humans, as they do in mouse models.

Thus, to the best of our knowledge, the amelioration of progeroid features observed here is the first in vivo demonstration in compound heterozygous animals of interallelic complementation relevant to a human disease.

Mice heterosomic for chromosomes 5 or 17 had rebleeding times similar to C57BL / 6J mice, but when these two chromosome substitution strains, B6 - Chr5A / J and B6 - Chr17A / J, were crossed, the A / J phenotype was restored in these doubly heterosomic progeny.

Broze et al [ 29] evaluated mice with gene deletions of the coagulation pathway and found that while bleeding time was not increased, rebleeding persisted despite electrocautery of the tail in FVIII and FIX deficient mice.

In the tail bleeding assay, A / J mice did not have changes in bleeding time, but rebleeding time was higher compared to B6 mice.

Matsuno et al [ 32] reported no difference in bleeding time for tPA - / -, uPA - / -, PAI - 1 - / - mice compared to WT mice, and the assay was similar, but the tail clip segment was considerably shorter and bleeding times reduced compared to the times reported in our study.

In mouse ES cells, we show that CAF - 1 is also required for regular levels of H4K20me3 at pericentric repeats, but not at IAP elements, which are repeated sequences spread all over the mouse genome.

Interestingly, the budding yeast genome does not contain heterochromatin regions equivalent to those of higher eukaryotes, and several hallmark features of heterochromatin such as di - and trimethylation at H3K9, H3K27, and H4K20 are not observed in the silent chromatin of S. cerevisiae.

RbloxP / loxP; E2f1 + / - and RbloxP / loxP; E2f1 + / -; alpha - Cre mice were bred to produce RbloxP / loxP; E2f1 - / -; alpha - Cre mice at a frequency of 1 / 8 and littermate controls at the same or higher ( 1 / 4) frequency.
