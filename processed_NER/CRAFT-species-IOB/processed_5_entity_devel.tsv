Cholesterol is a necessary membrane constituent of all mammalian, reptile and avian cells, as well as a few other organisms, but not all eukaryotic organisms.

Categorical division of reversal errors ( Ferry et al., 2000) - digging in the dish that did not contain the food pellet ( S -) ( error of commission; Fig. 5A) versus failing to respond within 3 - min of presentation ( error of omission; Fig. 5B) revealed that both genotypes chiefly committed errors of commission versus errors of omission ( D2R - / - mice, U = 0. 00; p < 0. 01; D2R + / + mice U = 9. 00, p < 0. 05), D2R - / - mice committed more commission errors than D2R + / + mice ( U = 5. 00, p < 0. 05), and there were no differences between D2R - / - and D2R + / + mice in omission errors ( U = 27. 5, p = 0. 65).

In order to examine evolutionary relationships of proteins containing coiled coil domains, protein sequences representing the major members of this super family, including TACC, RHAMM, KLP, keratin and tropomyosin from available vertebrates and their recognizable orthologues from the urochordate Ciona intestinalis, Drosophila melanogaster, C. elegans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were either directly retrieved from NCBI sequence databases, newly predicted or isolated ( see above).

Given the difficulty of studying lethal developmental abnormalities in humans, it is of great potential utility to develop animal models of human birth defects, as the specific genetic abnormalities found in animal models can then be investigated in human populations.

Note that the amount of human E2 protein ( predicted MW ~ 54 Kd) in mice from Lines A and 525 A was variable but in many of the animals the amount was similar to the amount of mouse E2 ( MW = ~ 47 Kd) in control animals.
