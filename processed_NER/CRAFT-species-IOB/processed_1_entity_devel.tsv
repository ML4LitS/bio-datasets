To determine the mechanisms that control regional differences in pigmentation, we have studied how a classical mouse mutation, droopy ear ( deH), affects dorsoventral skin characteristics, especially those under control of the Agouti gene.	"mouse	111	116	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Mice carrying the Agouti allele black - and - tan ( at) normally have a sharp boundary between dorsal black hair and yellow ventral hair; the deH mutation raises the pigmentation boundary, producing an apparent dorsal - to - ventral transformation.	"Mice	0	4	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Mice"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We identify a 216 kb deletion in deH that removes all but the first exon of the Tbx15 gene, whose embryonic expression in developing mesenchyme correlates with pigmentary and skeletal malformations observed in deH / deH animals.

Early embryonic expression of Tbx15 in dorsal mesenchyme is complementary to Agouti expression in ventral mesenchyme; in the absence of Tbx15, expression of Agouti in both embryos and postnatal animals is displaced dorsally.

A fundamental question in developmental biology is how adjacent regions of the vertebrate body acquire differences in their appearance or morphology.	"vertebrate	79	89	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""vertebrate"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Mechanisms that establish the general body plan make use of a relatively small number of signaling pathways shared among all animals ( reviewed in Pires - daSilva and Sommer 2003), but the extent to which these pathways control finer differences between body regions is not clear.	"animals	125	132	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Among these, pigment patterns are an excellent system to investigate how morphological differences arise, both for different regions of the body within a species and for different animals from closely related species.

In the laboratory, color variation has been the subject of vertebrate genetics for more than a century ( Searle 1968; Silvers 1979), and many pigmentary components have been identified whose actions are understood in a cellular or organ - based context ( reviewed in Bennett and Lamoreux 2003).	"vertebrate	59	69	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""vertebrate"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Several mechanisms may contribute to regional differences in vertebrate pigmentation.	"vertebrate	61	71	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""vertebrate"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
One of the most obvious aspects of regional color variation in vertebrates is a dark dorsal surface juxtaposed to a light ventral surface, apparent in the color of skin, scales, feathers, or hair, in which the boundary between dorsal and ventral compartments is often sharp and lies in register with the limbs.	"vertebrates	63	74	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""vertebrates"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In laboratory mice, previous studies from our group and others identified two predominant Agouti mRNA isoforms that differ by virtue of their transcriptional initiation site and 5 ' untranslated exons.	"mice	14	18	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Animals carrying the at allele express only the ventral - specific Agouti transcript ( Bultman et al. 1994; Vrieling et al. 1994) and have black dorsal hairs and cream - colored to yellow ventral hairs, with a sharp boundary at the level of the limb - body wall articulations and in the middle of the whisker pad.	"Animals	0	7	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Animals"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
To better understand the mechanisms that give rise to differences between dorsal and ventral skin and to the boundary between them, we have determined how several morphologic characteristics vary along the dorsoventral axis of the mouse and how these characteristics correspond to ventral - specific Agouti expression and the lineage boundary that distinguishes somite from lateral plate derivatives.	"mouse	231	236	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 231, ""end_span"": 236, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We also make use of a classical mouse mutation, droopy ear ( Curry 1959), that produces a dorsal - to - ventral transformation of flank coat color by allowing expansion of the ventral - specific Agouti transcript.	"mouse	32	37	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These results identify a previously unappreciated aspect of dorsoventral patterning that is widely represented in furred mammals and provide insight into the mechanisms that underlie region - specific differences in body morphology.	"mammals	121	128	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mammals"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In particular, ventral hair of at / at animals can vary from cream - colored to reddish - yellow depending on age, strain background, and position along the dorsoventral axis.	"animals	39	46	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
To evaluate the relationship among these components, we compared their features among mice of different Agouti genotypes.	"mice	86	90	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Semiquantitative measurements of hair length plotted as a function of dorsoventral position reveal that the apparent sharp boundary between dorsal and ventral pigment compartments in at / at mice coincides with a more gradual change in both hair color and hair length ( Figure 1A - 1D).	"mice	191	195	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 191, ""end_span"": 195, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Within the region of transition from dorsum to ventrum ( Figure 1B), flank hairs from at / at mice become progressively shorter and exhibit increasing amounts of pheomelanin deposition progressing from the tip to the base of the hair.	"mice	94	98	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Although hair - cycle timing varies along the rostrocaudal axis, measurements of absolute hair length for mice matched for age and rostrocaudal level are remarkably similar ( Figure 1D).	"mice	106	110	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Furthermore, measurements of relative hair length for animals of different age, size, and Agouti genotype also are very similar when normalized to body circumference ( Figure 1C).	"animals	54	61	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Taken together, these observations indicate that variation of hair length along the dorsoventral axis is stereotyped and maintained through multiple hair cycles, with a transition in hair length that is gradual and encompasses the pigment - type transition in at / at mice.	"mice	268	272	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 268, ""end_span"": 272, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, differences in skin thickness disappear by 3 - 4 wk of age ( Forsthoefel et al. 1966), and, overall, the proportion of different hair types is also similar in dorsa and ventra of adult mice.	"mice	194	198	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 194, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

Regardless, dorsoventral differences in hair pigment content of ae / ae mice persist throughout multiple hair cycles into adulthood, similar to hair length ( but unlike skin thickness).	"mice	72	76	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Named after its effects on craniofacial morphology, droopy ear is a recessive mutation on mouse Chromosome 3; the original allele described more than 40 years ago by Curry ( 1959) is extinct, but a spontaneous remutation that occurred in Harwell, deH, is available through The Jackson Laboratory ( Bar Harbor, Maine, United States).	"mouse	90	95	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
External craniofacial malformations are the most obvious characteristic of deH / deH animals, including widely spaced eyes, small palpebral fissures, a broad nasal area, and a shortened skull held in an elevated position, which presumably causes or contributes to the abnormal position of the ears.	"animals	85	92	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The ventral region has short hairs with a gray base and cream - colored tip whose boundary coincides with the limb - body wall junction; both the appearance of this region and position of the boundary are approximately similar in at / at compared to at / at; deH / deH mice.	"mice	269	273	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 269, ""end_span"": 273, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The proportion of the ventral cream - colored region is also expanded a small amount, 47. 9% in mutant compared to 37. 8% in nonmutant animals, but expansion of the lateral region, which occurs at all levels of the body, including the limbs and the cranium ( but not the whisker pad), is the major feature responsible for the ventralized appearance caused by deH.	"animals	135	142	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Overall, deH causes a small but consistent reduction in hair length in both dorsum and ventrum; when mutant and nonmutant animals are normalized for body circumference, reduced hair length is most apparent in the lateral region ( Figure 2E).	"animals	122	129	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Adult ae / ae; deH / deH animals exhibit body - size reduction and skeletal abnormalities, but display no coat - color phenotype ( data not shown).	"animals	25	32	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The skin of ae / ae neonates appears uniformly dark over the entire dorsum, but in ae / ae; deH / deH neonates, the area of dark skin is more restricted, particularly above the limbs, and resembles the pattern of dorsal eumelanin in at / at; deH / deH adult animals.	"animals	258	265	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 258, ""end_span"": 265, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
( 1998) and the partially completed mouse genome sequence, we found that portions of several Tbx15 exons could not be amplified from deH / deH genomic DNA.	"mouse	36	41	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The same gene was initially referred to as Tbx8 ( Wattler et al. 1998) and then later renamed Tbx14, but is currently referred to in several vertebrate genomes as Tbx15 ( Agulnik et al. 1998; Begemann et al. 2002).	"vertebrate	141	151	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""vertebrate"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
By comparing the sequence of a 1. 3 kb junction fragment amplified from deH / deH genomic DNA to publicly available mouse genome sequence, we identified a 216 kb deletion that extends from Tbx15 intron 1 to 148 kb downstream of the polyadenylation sequence in a region annotated as a mannose - 6 - phosphate receptor pseudogene, M6pr - ps ( Figure 3B and 3C).	"mouse	116	121	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Animals heterozygous for the targeted allele are completely normal with regard to size, skeletal morphology, and hair - color distribution, but Tbx15LacZ / Tbx15LacZ homozygotes were noted to exhibit reduced body size and an abnormal craniofacial appearance identical to that caused by deH.	"Animals	0	7	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Animals"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
To investigate this pattern in more detail, we hybridized a Tbx15 mRNA probe to a series of transverse sections at E12. 5 and observed expression in multiple mesenchymal tissues of the head, trunk, and developing limbs ( Figure 4A), much of which is consistent with the skull, cervical vertebrae, and limb malformations reported for mice carrying the original droopy ear allele.	"mice	333	337	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 333, ""end_span"": 337, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We were particularly interested in determining the exact nature of the embryonic flank expression relative to the ventralized phenotype of adult deH / deH mice.	"mice	155	159	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 159, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In P4. 5 skin, expression of Agouti is also extended dorsally in deH / deH animals and is most apparent in the midflank region within the upper dermis and dermal papillae cells ( Figure 6B).	"animals	75	82	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Thus, while the pigmentation phenotype of deH / deH mice can be explained, not surprisingly, by dorsal extension of Agouti expression after birth, patterned expression of Tbx15 and Agouti are apparent some 10 days earlier, between E12. 5 and E13. 5, and the effects of Tbx15 deficiency on expression of Agouti can be detected by E14. 5.

The ectodermal notch that we used to mark the boundary between embryonic dorsum and embryonic flank is a characteristic feature in vertebrate embryos.	"vertebrate	131	141	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""vertebrate"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Although fate - mapping studies have not been carried out in mammalian embryos, somite - and lateral plate - derived mesoderm could give rise to precursors for dermis dorsal and ventral to the limb - body wall junction, respectively.	"mammalian	61	70	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mammalian"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In whole - mount skin preparations from P1. 5 or P4. 5 neonatal animals, we observed a ventral band of dark X - Gal staining corresponding to lateral plate - derived dermis, which represents 63% of the total circumference ( Figure 8A).	"animals	64	71	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, in parallel preparations from at / at mice, the ventral pheomelanin domain represents 47% of the total skin circumference; therefore, the proportions of total skin circumference occupied by dorsal eumelanin and somite - derived dermis are 53% and 37%, respectively ( Figure 8B).	"mice	47	51	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Ventral areas that normally produce yellow hair in the trunk, limbs, and craniofacial regions are expanded in deH / deH mice and, in the trunk at least, represent inappropriate dorsal expression of an Agouti mRNA isoform that is normally restricted to ventral skin.	"mice	120	124	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These findings represent a novel role for T - box gene action in embryonic development and provide evidence for a previously unappreciated complexity to acquisition of dorsoventral positional identity in mammalian skin.

The visual boundary between dorsal and ventral skin in at / at mice is reminiscent of other systems in which adjacent compartments enforce a binary choice between alternative patterns of gene expression and cell fate ( reviewed in Dahmann and Basler 1999).	"mice	63	67	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The three gradients are close but not congruent, and it is their proximity that gives rise to the superficial distinction between dorsal and ventral skin of at / at mice.	"mice	165	169	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 169, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Loss of Tbx15 affects dorsoventral transitions of hair length, pigment content, and expression of the ventral - specific Agouti isoform; however, the former two effects are subtle and contribute little, if at all, to the abnormal pigmentation of adult deH / deH mice.	"mice	262	266	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 262, ""end_span"": 266, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
"Thus, despite the abnormal pattern of dark skin in neonatal deH / deH mice ( e. g., Figure 2D), the most obvious feature in adults is dorsal displacement of the "" boundary "" between black and yellow hair ( Figure 9A)."

However, it would not be surprising to find some degree of functional redundancy in animals mutated for two or three of the subfamily members in other body regions, particularly the limbs and the head.

For example, mutations in Tbx22 cause the human syndrome X - linked cleft palate and ankyloglossia ( Braybrook et al. 2001).	"human	42	47	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In an initial description of the expression and map location of mouse Tbx15, Agulnik et al.	"mouse	64	69	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
( 1998) suggested human Tbx15 that lies on Chromosome 1p11. 1 as a candidate for acromegaloid facial appearance ( AFA) syndrome, for which there is a weak positive LOD score to Chromosome 1p ( Hughes et al. 1985).	"human	18	23	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The deH phenotype exhibits little overlap with these features; instead, we suggest a more likely candidate for mutations of human TBX15 would be frontofacionasal syndrome, an unmapped autosomal recessive condition characterized by brachycephaly, blepharophimosis, and midface hypoplasia ( Reardon et al. 1994).

Our attention to the role of Tbx15 in pigment patterning was motivated by the effects of Agouti in postnatal animals.	"animals	109	116	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Because an expanded domain of embryonic Agouti expression in deH / deH animals is detectable by E14. 5, the effects of Tbx15 on dorsoventral patterning must occur prior to this time.	"animals	71	78	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Either mechanism may apply to the apparent dorsal - to - ventral transformation in deH / deH mice.	"mice	93	97	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
For example, while the expanded domain of Agouti expression in postnatal deH / deH animals can be traced to events that occur between E11. 5 and E13. 5, the underlying cause may be that embryonic cells in dorsolateral mesenchyme acquire a ventral rather than dorsal identity or that those cells fail to proliferate normally, followed by compensatory expansion of ventral cells.	"animals	83	90	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Cell lineage studies should provide a definitive answer, but we favor the latter hypothesis, because measurements of dorsoventral regions according to hair color in deH / deH mice revealed a small increase of the cream - colored ventral region in addition to the approximate doubling of the yellow flank region ( see Figure 2).	"mice	175	179	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 179, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, the ability of Tbx15 to suppress expression of the ventral - specific Agouti isoform in postnatal mice is likely to be indirect, since postnatal expression of Tbx15 occurs broadly along the dorsoventral axis and overlaps extensively with that of Agouti.	"mice	107	111	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In either case, the targets of Tbx15 action in the skin include genes in addition to Agouti, since hair length and melanocyte distribution exhibit a demonstrable, albeit subtle, alteration in animals that carry a null Agouti allele.	"animals	192	199	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 192, ""end_span"": 199, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, neither normal patterns of pigment - type synthesis in the limb nor their disruption in deH / deH mice correspond to obvious developmental compartments.	"mice	107	111	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
( Ectopic pigmentation of the ventral footpads that develops in En1 mutant mice is unrelated to pigment - type synthesis and instead likely reflects a requirement for En1, independent of Wnt7a, to repress migration or proliferation ( or both) of pigment cells in ventral epidermis [ Cygan et al. 1997; Loomis et al. 1998].)

However, the number and apparent position of the mammary glands are normal in deH / deH animals, indicating the existence of additional mechanisms that control dorsoventral patterning in the trunk as well as in the limbs.

The lateral somitic frontier, defined as the lineage boundary between somite - derived versus lateral plate - derived mesoderm, is established during somitogenesis early in development ( Mauger 1972; Christ et al. 1983; Olivera - Martinez et al. 2000; Nowicki et al. 2003), but remains distinct in postnatal animals despite the potential for extensive cell mixing ( see Figure 8).	"animals	308	315	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 308, ""end_span"": 315, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Thus, there exist at least three distinct boundaries in postnatal mammalian skin that are parallel to the sagittal plane, marked by differences in pigment - type synthesis, differences in cell lineage, and differences in expression of Msx1.

Past experiments seeking to explore the possible involvement of dopamine D2Rs in associative learning have utilized low to moderate doses of drugs [ 2, 5, 6] and site - specific administration [ 7, 9] in order to avoid the confounding effect that locomotor disruption associated with acute D2R blockade can have on learning performance in rodents.	"rodents	339	346	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""rodents"", ""start_span"": 339, ""end_span"": 346, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Moreover, acute dosing does not recapitulate the marked learning deficits produced in rodents [ 15, 16] by chronic exposure to dopamine D2R antagonists [ 6, 7].	"rodents	86	93	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""rodents"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Moreover an inverse relationship between lower dopamine D2R levels and compulsive behavior in human subjects has been reported [ 22].	"human	94	99	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Here we report that dopamine D2R - mediated signaling must be intact if a mouse is to efficiently learn to associate a food reinforcer with a specific odor and then adaptively disengage inappropriate behavioral strategies following the reversal of reinforcement contingencies.

Both wild - type and D2R deficient mice learn operant behaviors equally well	"mice	35	39	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Mildly food - deprived D2R + / + and D2R - / - mice readily learned to locate and consume food pellets during both training sessions.	"mice	47	51	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

Following session 5, the remaining 5 D2R + / + mice had met criteria.	"mice	47	51	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
For the D2R - / - mice, each point on the graph represents 8 subjects.	"mice	18	22	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
None of the D2R - / - mice achieved the criterion of 80% accuracy by session 5.	"mice	22	26	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
D2R - / - mice demonstrated that they were capable of learning to locate and consume food pellets, indicating that their locomotor behavior was not detectably disrupted and their primary motivation to obtain a natural reinforcer ( food pellet) was undisturbed.	"mice	10	14	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Rather, the impaired ability of D2R - / - mice to assign appropriate discriminative stimulus relationships in an operant discrimination task argues that D2R - mediated signaling contributes to the neuronal processes involved in attaching salience to environmental stimuli.	"mice	42	46	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The deficient capacity of D2R - / - mice to disengage inappropriate decision strategies strongly argues that mesolimbic dopamine signaling, mediated by dopamine D2Rs is essential for efficient reversal learning to occur.	"mice	36	40	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Mice with or without intact dopamine D2R - mediated signaling displayed similar decreases in latencies to retrieve unhidden food pellets ( Fig. 1) and learned to dig for food buried in unscented sand ( Fig. 2).	"Mice	0	4	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Mice"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These findings are in complete agreement with earlier studies that utilized rats and fairly selective D2R antagonists [ 3 - 8], as well as even very extensive 6 - OHDA lesions [ 1, 10, 11] in associative and operant learning paradigms.	"rats	76	80	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""rats"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The comparatively poor skill of D2R - / - mice during discrimination trials suggests a role for D2Rs in acquisition of appropriate S + / S - relationships in operant associative learning.	"mice	42	46	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
"One might then ask: "" How then could the role of D2Rs in associative learning be dissociated from motor behavior? "" Seminal experiments [ 26 - 28] have clearly demonstrated that repeated administration of catalepsy - inducing doses of D2R antagonists in rodents actually leads to a striking behavioral tolerance to catalepsy."	"rodents	254	261	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""rodents"", ""start_span"": 254, ""end_span"": 261, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Future experiments measuring acquisition of associative learning in rodents that received chronic administration of D2R antagonists and demonstrated behavioral tolerance to their motor disrupting effects would be a logical test of this hypothesis.	"rodents	68	75	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""rodents"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We would argue that the most parsimonious approach at this time is to utilize mice that have been genetically altered such that they are lacking one or both functional alleles of the specific receptor of interest.	"mice	78	82	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
A cursory analysis of our data might suggest to some that the genetic manipulation of the drd2 locus conferred a gross olfactory impairment to the D2R - / - mice.	"mice	157	161	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Rather, we argue that this is not likely because the D2R - / - mice did learn to retrieve the food pellets from the dishes and eventually learned to accurately discriminate odors.	"mice	63	67	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The performance of D2R - / - mice during reversal learning is deficient revealing a role for dopamine D2R - mediated signaling in tasks requiring behavioral flexibility	"mice	29	33	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This manipulation would control the number of errors based on trials performed to determine if the apparent difference in absolute number of errors demonstrated by the mutant mice ( the putative performance deficit) is simply a reflection of extra trials.	"mice	175	179	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 179, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Nonetheless, the inability of D2R - / - mice to disengage from previously established S + / S - contingencies ( responding to a discriminative stimulus; Fig. 4) strongly argues that mesolimbic dopamine, and in particular dopamine D2R - mediated signaling, modulates the process of alerting the subject that familiar contingencies are now associated unexpected consequences.	"mice	40	44	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The inability of the D2R - / - mice to desist responding to a previously reinforced stimulus suggests that the dopamine D2R might in fact be the focal point of this error - signaling cascade.	"mice	31	35	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
[ 34] demonstrated that tetanic stimulation of dorsal striatum slices prepared from D2R - / - mice is associated with enhanced EPSP and as a result increased striatal synaptic efficacy.	"mice	94	98	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In contrast, stimulation of dorsal striatum slices from wild - type mice resulted in IPSP activity, long - term depression, and decreased neuronal activity of striatal efferents [ 34].	"mice	68	72	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Indeed, perseverative behavior is associated with over activity of the dorsal striatum in rodents [ 36] and over activity of the caudate in patients with ADHD [ 37] and a strong inverse correlation of D2R binding with compulsive behavior has been reported [ 22].	"rodents	90	97	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""rodents"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Importantly, our data indicate that the poor performances displayed by the D2R - / - mice are manifestations of reversal learning deficits and not gross motivational or sensory impairments.	"mice	85	89	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We therefore argue that D2Rs participate in signaling or alerting the organism of learning contingency changes during reversal learning and sculpt ongoing goal - directed behavior.	"organism	70	78	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""organism"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, mice completely deficient in D2Rs demonstrated disrupted acquisition of discriminative stimulus relationships and an impaired ability to recognize changes in behavioral determinants.	"mice	9	13	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Possibly, the lack of dopamine D2R - mediated signaling prevents refinement of the corticostriatal reinforcement circuits in the brains of the D2R - / - mice, thus impairing their ability to form S + / S - contingencies and disengage inappropriate dopamine D1R - mediated associative responding when unexpected consequences to goal - directed behaviors happened.	"mice	153	157	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Consequently, we are compelled to conclude that the perseverative performance deficits demonstrated by the D2R - / - mice in the tasks used in the present study reveal a previously unreported role for D2Rs in associative and reversal learning.

The sixteen, 8 - 10 week old, 25 - 30 g mice ( 8 per genotype) used in this study were the congenic offspring of breeders that were descendants of the original F2 hybrid ( 129 / Sv x C57BL / 6J; Kelly et al., 1997) that was backcrossed to inbred C57Bl / 6J stock ( Jackson Laboratories, ME).

Odor discrimination was chosen as the particular task because it is a highly robust behavior in rodents [ 18].	"rodents	96	103	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""rodents"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

Thus, with the appropriate application of bioinformatics, it is now possible to trace the lineage of particular genes and gene families, with related gene families in other organisms.

The first Transforming acidic coiled coil gene, TACC1, was identified during the development of an expression map of the proximal short arm of human chromosome 8 [ 1].	"human	143	148	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Two additional TACC family members were subsequently identified and mapped to paralogous chromosomal regions on human chromosomes 4p16 and 10q26, physically close to members of the FGFR gene family [ 1 - 3].

Thus, the identification and functional characterization of new members of the TACC family in other organisms, alternatively spliced isoforms of each TACC and comparison of the phylogenetic relationship of these genes relative to other members of the coiled coil superfamily will resolve this issue and provide clues to the evolution of TACC function.

Where possible, the construction of the TACC sequences from these organisms was also confirmed by the analysis of the cDNA databases.	"organisms	66	75	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""organisms"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, due to the relative infancy of the cDNA / genome projects for these latter organisms, complete characterization of these TACC genes could not be undertaken.	"organisms	84	93	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""organisms"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

Of these, two genes corresponded to the T. rubripes orthologues of human TACC2 and TACC3.	"human	67	72	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

Therefore, this analysis of T. rubripes does not support the hypothesis that the region surrounding the TACC3 ancestor was included in the second round of vertebrate genomic duplication.

Evidence used in support of this claim included its chromosomal location on 5q32 in humans ( discussed below), its sequence similarity in its coiled coil domain to the TACC domain and the subcellular localization of the RHAMM protein in the centrosome.

It is interesting that each TACC gene contains one large exon, which shows considerable variability between TACC orthologues, and constitutes the main difference between the TACC3 genes in the vertebrates ( see below).

TACC3 can be divided into three sections: a conserved N - terminal region ( CNTR) of 108 amino acids, encoded by exons 2 and 3 in each vertebrate TACC3 gene, the conserved TACC domain distributed over the final seven exons, and a highly variable central region.

The results of our functional analysis, as well as other published data clearly indicate that the vertebrate TACCs interact with proteins that can be divided into two broad categories: 1) proteins with roles in centrosome / mitotic spindle dynamics, and 2) proteins involved in gene regulation, either at the level of transcription, or subsequent RNA processing and translation [ 3, 5 - 7, 15, 19 - 21, 24, 25, 33, 34].	"vertebrate	98	108	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""vertebrate"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Significant analysis of the association of the TACCs with the centrosome and the dynamics of mitotic spindle assembly from yeast to humans has been published [ 5, 6, 21 - 24].	"yeast	123	128	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""yeast"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, the variability of the central domain of the vertebrate orthologues, suggests that TACC3 may also have acquired additional, and in some instances, species - specific functions.	"vertebrate	54	64	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""vertebrate"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
For instance, in X. laevis, the maskin protein has acquired a binding site for the eIF4E protein, and thus a function in the coordinated control of polyadenylation and translation in the Xenopus oocyte [ 8, 35].

In fact, the first identified function of a vertebrate TACC protein was as a transcriptional coactivator acting through a direct interaction with the ARNT transcription factor [ 7].

This further suggests that the vertebrate TACCs have gained the specific ability to direct interact with transcriptional regulatory complexes, and that bridging protein ( s) are no longer required.

This may also explain the absence of lin15A, lin36 and lin37 homologues in higher organisms, as they were no longer under selective evolutionary pressure to remain within the complex, and thus lost in the evolving genome.

It has been shown that HGF is expressed along this anatomic pathway [ 23], and mice with absence of the HGF receptor c - Met fail to form muscularized pleuroperitoneal folds ( PPFs), and thus have amuscular diaphragms [ 24, 25].

We suggest that the abnormal electroretinograms, slow retinal degeneration, and retinal dysmorphology seen in humans with ESCS may, in part, be attributable to the aberrant function of a hybrid photoreceptor cell type similar to that identified in this study.

Curiously, the ERG of the mouse under both light and dark adaptation has been reported to be normal, showing progressive attenuation with time, presumably due to degenerative cell loss [ 15].

In order to better understand the mechanistic basis of ESCS, we undertook a molecular and ultrastructural analysis of the photoreceptors of the rd7 mutant mouse.	"mouse	155	160	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 160, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Previous studies have estimated that the total number of cones in the mouse retina is 2% of all retinal cells [ 20], and that S - opsin is largely repressed in cones in the dorsal third of the retina [ 21].	"mouse	70	75	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The fact that only 3. 2% of all retinal cells are S - opsin - positive in the rd7 mutant also confirms that the majority of the photoreceptors ( which make up just over 70% of the cells in the adult mouse retina) do not express this gene.	"mouse	199	204	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 199, ""end_span"": 204, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Although such a pattern of transcript localization is commonly seen in many rod - specific genes ( e. g., Rho in Figure 2; Pcdh21, Rbp3, and Cnga1 in Table S2), it is not easily appreciated in cone - specific genes, possibly due to the relative scarcity of cones in the mouse.	"mouse	270	275	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 270, ""end_span"": 275, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Furthermore, the repression of S - opsin expression in the dorsal third of the mouse retina is thought to depend, at least in part, on Thrb2 since S - opsin shows dorsal derepression in the Thrb2 mutant [ 22].	"mouse	79	84	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
It is known that until P11, the cell bodies of cone photoreceptors in the mouse are normally dispersed throughout the ONL, only to relocate subsequently to the scleral edge of the ONL around P12 [ 23].

This in situ hybridization pattern is consistent with staining in M u ller glia, the principal glial cell type of the mouse retina.	"mouse	118	123	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The cell bodies were chosen for evaluation rather than the outer segments, since in the mouse, the ultrastructural differences between rod and cone somata are much greater than are the differences between the outer segments [ 26].

In the wild - type mouse, cone cell bodies are aligned along the scleral border of the ONL, and they are larger than those of rods.	"mouse	19	24	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Both studies showed that cone genes in addition to S - cone opsin are derepressed in the mouse rd7 mutant.	"mouse	89	94	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

An alternative explanation would be that there is only a single, homogeneous population of postmitotic rod precursors in the mouse, and a stochastic event triggers assumption of the S - cone fate in a small subpopulation of these cells in the rd7 mutant.

Human patients with ESCS display three types of abnormality attributable to the retina: ( 1) an atypical ERG waveform that is preferentially sensitive to short - wavelength light, ( 2) slowly progressive retinal degeneration, and ( 3) abnormal retinal lamination with rosette formation [ 1, 12, 13].	"Human	0	5	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Human"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The rd7 mutant mice also demonstrate the latter two defects, but have a normal ERG [ 15, 45].	"mice	15	19	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The fact that the rd7 mouse has a normal ERG strongly suggests that the aberrant ERG in ESCS is not attributable to the activity of a hybrid photoreceptor identical to that found in this study.	"mouse	22	27	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This conclusion is consistent with the evidence from human ESCS patients indicating a markedly reduced rod system and a lack of measurable rhodopsin by reflection densitometry [ 1, 2, 10, 11].	"human	53	58	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These findings, however, do not rule out the possibility that the abnormal human ERG derives from a hybrid photoreceptor cell type that also expresses S - opsin.	"human	75	80	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

Overexpression of wild - type crumbs in Drosophila has been shown to cause polarity defects leading to waviness of epithelia and even to misalignment of nuclei within photoreceptors analogous to what is seen in the rd7 retina [ 47, 51].

It is interesting to note that in these mouse lines only ~ 5 - 6% of normal BCKDH activity in the liver was sufficient to allow survival.	"mouse	40	45	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We also demonstrated that BCAA levels in blood of these rescue mice were intermediate between controls and knockouts.	"mice	63	67	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

The strategy behind our approach was to create mice with an intermediate MSUD phenotype that could be converted to the classic phenotype at the investigator ' s discretion by turning off the rescuing transgene.

The most significant opportunity presented by the MSUD mouse models is to test novel treatments such as gene [ 38 - 41] and cell based therapies ( e. g., hepatocytes [ 42, 43] or embryonic stem cells [ 44]).

Mutations in ATRX provided the first example of a human genetic disease associated with defects in such proteins.	"human	50	55	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
To better understand the role of ATRX in development and the associated abnormalities in the ATR - X ( alpha thalassemia mental retardation, X - linked) syndrome, we conditionally inactivated the homolog in mice, Atrx, at the 8 - to 16 - cell stage of development.	"mice	207	211	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 207, ""end_span"": 211, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Carrier female mice that inherit a maternal null allele should be affected, since the paternal X chromosome is normally inactivated in extraembryonic tissues.	"mice	15	19	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Together these findings demonstrate an unexpected, specific, and essential role for Atrx in the development of the murine trophoblast and present an example of escape from imprinted X chromosome inactivation.

Mutations in the ATRX gene, which is located on the female sex chromosome ( X), provided the first example of a human disease ( ATR - X syndrome) associated with defects in such proteins.	"human	112	117	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
To address this question, the authors deleted the version of the gene in mice, Atrx.	"mice	73	77	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Although affected male mice ( XMUTY) started to develop normally, they died early in development because they failed to form a normal placenta.	"mice	23	27	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In the placenta, female mice normally inactivate the X chromosome that they inherit from their fathers ( Xp), so if females inherit from their mother an X chromosome ( Xm) that bears the abnormal copy of Atrx ( XmMUTXp), one would predict that, like affected males, they would fail to form a normal placenta.	"mice	24	28	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The mouse homolog of the ATRX gene, Atrx, is also situated on the X chromosome, and also gives rise to full - length ( Atrx, ~ 280 kDa) and truncated ( Atrxt, ~ 200 kDa) isoforms [ 4, 5].	"mouse	4	9	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

Exon 18 encodes the first of the seven motifs composing the conserved SNF2 - like domain of Atrx ( Figure 1); mutation of the corresponding motif of the yeast SNF2 protein has been shown to severely impair SWI / SNF - dependent gene expression [ 12].

Notably, the transcribed region of the ribosomal DNA ( rDNA) repeat was found to be significantly hypomethylated in ATR - X patients relative to normal individuals.	"individuals	152	163	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""individuals"", ""start_span"": 152, ""end_span"": 163, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Using methylation - sensitive restriction enzymes, we also observed significant hypomethylation at several sites tested within the mouse rDNA repeats in Atrxnull ES cells and 12 - d embryoid bodies relative to ES cells and embryoid bodies bearing a functional Atrx allele ( AtrxWT or Atrxflox) ( Figure 3B and 3C).	"mouse	131	136	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The observation that rDNA is hypomethylated in the absence of Atrx, even in ES cells, is consistent with the finding that hypomethylation of the human rDNA repeats is detectable from an early developmental stage in ATR - X patients.

Two independently targeted Atrxflox ES cell clones with normal male karyotype were injected into C57BL / 6 blastocysts to produce chimaeric mice, which were then used to obtain germline transmission.

To generate Atrxnull mice, heterozygous floxed females ( AtrxWT / flox) were mated with homozygous GATA1 - cre transgenic males ( AtrxWT / Y; GATA1 - cre + / +).	"mice	21	25	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

Female mice carrying an Atrxnull allele ( AtrxWT / null; GATA1 - cre + / -) were detected at 9. 5 dpc ( Table 1) and recovered at birth ( unpublished data), although at both time points the number of carrier females was lower than that of wild - type ( AtrxWT / WT; GATA1 - cre + / -) females, suggesting that a proportion of carrier female embryos died in utero.

In the mouse, X chromosome inactivation is subject to parental imprinting in the trophectoderm and primitive endoderm lineages that give rise to the extraembryonic tissues, resulting in inactivation of the paternal X chromosome ( Xp) [ 18].

By using a conditional knockout approach, we ablated the full - length Atrx protein first in ES cells and embryoid bodies, and then in developing mouse embryos.	"mouse	146	151	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Interestingly, we demonstrated that apoptosis is not significantly up - regulated in ES cells lacking Atrx and is only mildly elevated in Atrxnull 7. 5 dpc mouse embryos.	"mouse	156	161	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 156, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In contrast, it was recently shown that the loss of Atrx markedly increased the apoptotic population in the differentiating cells of the embryonic cortex and postnatal hippocampus, when Atrx expression was ablated in the developing mouse forebrain using the Atrxflox allele described here [ 20].

An alternative explanation for the unexpectedly severe phenotype we observed in mice is that the Atrx Delta 18 Delta neo deletion generated by Cre recombination completely ablates full - length Atrx protein ( Figure 2E).

While this study has revealed an unexpected role for Atrx in the murine trophectoderm, as a result of the early lethality observed in Atrxnull embryos it is not possible to rule out other roles for Atrx at later developmental stages in tissues of the embryo proper.	"murine	65	71	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""murine"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Tetraploid aggregation experiments ( in which mutant embryos are rescued with wild - type extraembryonic tissues) might shed more light on the role of Atrx during later mouse development, but these issues can be more subtly dissected by combining the conditional Atrxflox allele that we have generated with different tissue - specific Cre transgenes.	"mouse	169	174	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
As mentioned above, this approach has already revealed a critical role for Atrx during neuronal differentiation in adult mice [ 20].	"mice	121	125	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Atrx joins an expanding list of mouse genes for which targeted disruption results in peri - implantation lethality as a result of trophoblast or placental abnormalities ( reviewed in [ 25]).

The Atrx - mutant phenotype closely resembles that observed in mice nullizygous for the basic helix - loop - helix transcription factor Hand1.	"mice	63	67	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
It is noteworthy that, in the brain - specific Atrx knockout mice, the defect was observed in terminally differentiating neurons [ 20].	"mice	61	65	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The secondary TGCs affected in the universal Atrx knockout reported here represent one of the first terminally differentiated tissues in the developing mouse, and this may point to the requirement for Atrx in the high - level expression of some tissue - specific genes during the final stages of differentiation.

Another surprising finding of this study is that, in carrier female embryos, a paternally inherited AtrxWT allele appears to escape the process of imprinted X - inactivation, which ordinarily silences the Xp chromosome in the extraembryonic compartment of female murine tissues [ 18].	"murine	263	269	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""murine"", ""start_span"": 263, ""end_span"": 269, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Thus, the failure to correctly silence the paternally derived AtrxWT allele in the extraembryonic tissues of carrier females is consistent with our observations that in Atrxnull males, the Atrx protein plays an essential role in the development of the trophoblast and is necessary for survival in utero in the mouse.	"mouse	310	315	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 310, ""end_span"": 315, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The survival of Atrx carrier females contrasts with the phenotypes seen in carriers of mutations of other murine X - linked genes known to be essential in the extraembryonic compartment.	"murine	106	112	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""murine"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Female mice carrying mutations of these genes on the maternally inherited X chromosome also die in utero, whereas females that inherit the mutation on the Xp chromosome survive.	"mice	7	11	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 7, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, it was recently demonstrated that the paternal Atrx ( called Xnp) allele is completely silenced in a normal mouse trophoblast stem cell line [ 32], suggesting that Atrx does not normally escape imprinted X - inactivation in the extraembryonic tissues of wild - type females.	"mouse	117	122	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
"Perhaps a more likely explanation for this phenomenon stems from experimental observations suggesting that imprinted X - inactivation is not imposed on all precursors of the mouse extraembryonic tissues: A subpopulation of cells may escape this process and make a random "" choice "" of which X chromosome will be inactivated."

Immunohistochemistry of normal thymus from P3 to P17 mice showed a similar staining pattern for K14 in that its expression was restricted to a small population of TECs in the inner medullary region and in the keratinocytes in Hassall ' s corpuscles ( Figure 6D).

Varying degrees of differentiation - specific markers depending on the age of mice, in this case K1 and involucrin that are normally present only in Hassall ' s corpuscles, were also detected in mutant thymi ( Figure S3).

Experimental activation of epithelial beta - catenin signaling ( by expression of N - terminal - truncated, constitutively stabilized forms of beta - catenin or ectopic expression of Lef1) induces ectopic follicles in both mouse and chick skin [ 25 - 27].

Conversely, down - regulation of beta - catenin signaling ( through Lef1 knock - out, ectopic expression of Wnt inhibitor Dkk1 or conditional deletion of beta - catenin in epidermis) results in loss of vibrissae and some pelage follicles in mice [ 28 - 30].

( 1) Although the K14 promoter itself is known to initiate the expression at E9. 5 and elevated dramatically by E13. 5 - E14. 5 [ 19, 31], many factors could influence the expression of promoter / transgene construct in transgenic mice.

In contrast, Cre - mediated recombination is seen in E13. 5 skin of K14 - cre transgenic mice used in this study [ 16] and K14 - cre - mediated truncation of the Apc gene is likely to have occurred by then, in time for the second wave of hair follicle morphgenesis.

This observation was similar to the ectopic tooth buds found in animals misexpressing Lef1 [ 27], but more severe and was also present at birth, indicating the effect of Apc loss during the initiation of embryonic tooth development, which was evident by aberrant Shh expression in E15. 5 embryonic oral epithelium ( unpublished data).

It should be noted that although multiple tooth buds were histologically visible ( Figure 4O and 4P), these teeth never broke out and the KA mutant mice appeared toothless.	"mice	148	152	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

Absence of teeth and mammary glands have been observed in mice deficient in Lef1 and ectopically expressing Dkk1 [ 29, 30] but their absence was due to the block in development before the bud stage.

In this study, we observed that K14 - driven loss of Apc resulted in a small thymus with severe squamous metaplasia leading to the formation of numerous pyogranuloma and loss of proper meshwork structure for thymocyte maturation, rendering the mice athymic.

Sequencing of all exons and intron - exon boundaries of Itpr1 in affected mice from the current study revealed a single mutation within Itpr1: a novel in - frame deletion of 18 bp within exon 36 ( Itpr1 Delta 18 / Delta 18).

As with the Itpr1opt / opt mice, where the deletion of exons 43 and 44 is also predicted to leave the translational reading frame unaffected, the in - frame Itpr1 Delta 18 / Delta 18 deletion mutation results in markedly decreased levels of Itpr1 in cerebellar Purkinje cells.

In these two spontaneous mutants [ 1] and in the Itpr1 - deficient mouse [ 4] generated by gene targeting, decreased Itpr1 expression is associated with the same autosomal recessive movement disorder ( Figure 1).

Conversely, mutation of ITPR1 is biologically plausible as a cause of ataxia: the protein is highly expressed in Purkinje cells; as we have shown here, mice with mutation at this locus present with ataxia; and perturbed Ca2 + signaling has previously been implicated in the etiology of ataxia, notably in episodic ataxia type 2 and SCA6 [ 8].

In order to rule out the possibility that the observed deletion within ITPR1 was a benign copy number variant we examined log R ratio and B allele frequency metrics of HumanHap550 genotyping data at this locus from 577 individuals of Northern European descent from North America and Europe, produced by us as a part of an ongoing study.	"individuals	219	230	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""individuals"", ""start_span"": 219, ""end_span"": 230, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
On average each product was ~ 750 bp in size, and amplifications were performed using genomic DNA from each of the three affected individuals ( family members 6, 7, and 19).

Amplification of a fragment from a normal diploid genome was denoted by the presence of a heterozygous polymorphism; amplification of a fragment from a region of the genome harboring a heterozygous genomic deletion was inferred when homozygosity for the major allele and the minor allele were noted among the three affected family members ( i. e., this is inconsistent with Mendelian inheritance in related individuals known to share a common haplotype).

The fragment, which is 953 bp in size, was sequenced as described above and compared to the current build of the human genome.	"human	113	118	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
EBV immortalized lymphoblasts from three affected family members who carry the deletion and one family member without the mutation were used as a readily accessible source of protein; all samples came from members of family AUS1.

Notably, there appears to be decreased immunoreactivity to Itpr1 in the heterozygous and homozygous mutant mice.	"mice	107	111	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Analysis of these data narrowed the unknown region, and ultimately we were able to use primer T3f and C11r to amplify across the deletion breakpoint in the three affected family members, producing a fragment of 953 bp in affected individuals.
