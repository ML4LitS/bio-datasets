Previously, we developed a method to measure IOP in mice and reported initial findings on the magnitude of mouse IOP [ 13].

Twelve to 25 mice were analyzed for each strain ( typically 18 to 20), except for RIIIS / J ( 7 mice).

Approximately half of the CE / J and one third of the BUB / BnJ mice were 16 months old and were pooled with the younger mice, as the IOPs of both ages were the same.

More than 20% of CBA / CaJ mice had IOPs of over 21 mmHg, which increases risk for glaucoma in humans.

Although the decrease was of a similar level to the variation observed in 3 month old mice ( see Figure 3), the IOPs of control young mice ( see Methods) analyzed at the same times as the various B6 age groups did not decrease.

To determine if allelic variation in the mouse Myoc gene associated with IOP in mouse strains, we analyzed the gene in an assortment of strains with different IOPs.

In 2 month old mice, homozygosity for Tyrc - 2J resulted in increased IOP ( 14. 2 +/- 0. 4 mmHg) compared to wild type, pigmented mice ( 12. 4 +/- 0. 3 mmHg, P < 0. 0001).

In contrast to pigmented B6 mice ( Figure 6), the IOPs of the albino B6 mice were not increased at measurement during the dark compared to light period of the day ( P = 0. 6, Figure 10B).

Thus, although both rat and mouse studies show that anesthesia decreases IOP, the studies do not agree on the timing of the effect.

Terpene administration or environmental exposure to terpenes in wood shavings alters drug resistance and decreases the effect of anesthetic agents in both rats and mice [ 40 - 45].

Although within the range of variability observed in young mice, the IOP of B6 mice modestly decreased around 1 year of age.

At 2 years of age the IOP of B6 mice had decreased further, though an effect of anesthesia in these very old mice cannot be ruled out [ 49].

Our comparison of the relationship between blood pressure and IOP in young, adult female mice of different mouse strains, whose blood pressures differed up to 36 mmHg, did not reveal a positive correlation.

The molecular mechanisms underlying the diurnal rhythm are not defined but increased aqueous humor production or flow occurs during the period of increased IOP in both rabbits and humans [ 63 - 65].

It also is possible that CAII substantially contributes to aqueous humor secretion but that functional mouse CAIV is sufficient to prevent an effect of CAII deficiency on IOP in Car2 mutant mice.

Here, we show increased IOP in mice lacking tyrosinase activity compared to otherwise genetically identical pigmented B6 mice.

In agreement with this result, mice with albino eyes that are homozygous for tyrosinase or pink eye dilution mutations have altered diurnal rhythms compared to pigmented mice [ 75].

As demonstrated here, the IOPs of C57BL / 6J are very consistent over time and so these animals were interspersed with experimental mice during all experiments to ensure that calibration had not drifted and that the system was functioning optimally.

Fluorescent protein reporters currently represent a superior alternative to other gene - based reporters such as the bacterial lacZ or human placental alkaline phosphatase in that their visualization is non - invasive, and as such does not require chromogenic substrates.

Biliary sterols of Abcg8 - deficient mice were dramatically different compared to wild - type mice.

The ability of Abcg8 - / - mice to secrete bile salt and phospholipid into bile as compared to wild - type mice was not significantly impaired.

Abcg8 - / - mice appeared normal and healthy maintained on a regular rodent chow diet.

Interestingly, plasma triglyceride levels of the Abcg8 - / - mice were slightly higher than wild - type animals and this increased triglyceride is carried in the LDL fraction range, as measured by FPLC.	"mice	61	65	Organism"	"animals	104	111	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Hepatic levels of GC - measured cholesterol were greatly reduced in Abcg8 - / - mice compared to wild - type mice, yet mRNA levels of HMG - CoA reductase and enzyme activity are also reduced without any significant change in mRNA of the Srebps.	"mice	80	84	Organism"	"mice	109	113	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Another prediction, based upon the enzyme and mRNA levels in knockout mice, is that if these mice are placed on a high cholesterol / high sitosterol diet, they may show significant accumulation of both sterols in the body.	"mice	70	74	Organism"	"mice	93	97	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This may also be relevant to the human disorder where some, although not all affected individuals, manifest premature coronary artery disease.

The bile is sterol poor and upon stimulation by increasing bile salt excretion, Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 deficient mice cannot respond, in contrast to the wild - type mice.	"mice	111	115	Organism"	"mice	163	167	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 163, ""end_span"": 167, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
It could be argued that although the biliary sterol output is comparable to that seen in wild - type mice that this is inappropriately low, since the tissue and plasma pools of sitosterol are so elevated in the knockout mice.	"mice	101	105	Organism"	"mice	220	224	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 220, ""end_span"": 224, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Interestingly, although humans who are heterozygous for genetic defects in either ABCG5 or ABCG8 seem to be phenotypically normal, mice heterozygous for Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 deficiency show that sterol secretion is impaired, but not absent.	"humans	24	30	Organism"	"mice	131	135	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""humans"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Note that under steady - state conditions on a rodent chow diet, heterozygous animals show no significant elevations in plasma or tissue sitosterol levels, suggesting that the activity of these proteins may not be rate limiting.	"rodent	47	53	Organism"	"animals	78	85	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""rodent"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Furthermore, the heterozygous Abcg8 + / - mice showed higher levels of biliary sitosterol relative to the wild - type mice.	"mice	42	46	Organism"	"mice	118	122	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
While the rate of total biliary sterol secretion is reduced compared to wild - type mice, since the heterozygous mice are not sitosterolemic, either the activity of these proteins is not rate limiting or other mechanisms can compensate for a 50% loss of activity.	"mice	84	88	Organism"	"mice	113	117	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
On the other hand, since feeding is intermittent, a slow, but continuous secretion during post - prandial periods could easily negate any mild temporary increase in tissue and plasma plant sterol levels in heterozygous animals.	"plant	183	188	Organism"	"animals	219	226	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""plant"", ""start_span"": 183, ""end_span"": 188, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 219, ""end_span"": 226, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This may be amenable to testing by placing these animals on a high plant sterol diet and measuring the plasma sterol levels.

However, no esterified sitosterol in the livers from Abcg8 + / + and Abcg8 + / - mice and very little from Abcg8 - / - mice was detected ( panel b).

No differences were observed in the ability of the Abcg8 - / - mice to secrete bile salts ( panel d), but there is a marked inability of the knockout mice to secrete sterols ( panel e) and a trend towards a reduced ability to secrete phospholipid ( panel f) compared to wild type.

Detailed studies aimed at identifying the direct cause of deafness in Pendred syndrome have recently become possible due to the generation of a pendrin - specific polyclonal antibody [ 9] and the development of Slc26a4 - / - mice, which bear a targeted disruption of the mouse Slc26a4 gene [ 14].

The mouse strain 129Sv / Ev ( Taconic, Germantown, NY) was chosen as the source of Slc26a4 + / + controls, since Slc26a4 - / - mice were propagated in the this strain and generated using a stem cell line derived from 129Sv / Ev.

Morphologically detectable differences in the inner ears of Slc26a4 + / + and Slc26a4 - / - mice become evident as early as ED 15, when Slc26a4 - / - mice start to develop an enlarged endolymphatic space that persists into adulthood [ 14].

To determine in greater detail the cause of the loss of the endocochlear potential in Slc26a4 - / - mice, we isolated total RNA from stria vascularis and spiral ganglia of young ( 1 - 4 month) Slc26a4 + / + and both young and old ( ~ 12 month) Slc26a4 - / - mice, assessed amounts of isolated tissues by quantification of 18S rRNA, and quantified the expression of KCNJ10 mRNA.

ZO - 1 and F - actin expression revealed a continuous layer of basal cells, including a junction of basal cells with surface epithelial cells in Slc26a4 - / - mice, as observed in normal mice ( Fig. 1c, 1d, 1e, 1f, 6, 7).

Bumetanide - sensitive currents were found in both Slc26a4 + / + and Slc26a4 - / - mice although the magnitude of the current was significantly smaller in Slc26a4 - / - mice ( 22 +/- 6 mu A / cm2, n = 4 versus 14 +/- 2 mu A / cm2, n = 4).

To directly assess the role of activation of PPAR delta in control of muscle fiber plasticity and mitochondrial biogenesis, we generated mice expressing a transgene in which the 78 - amino - acid VP16 activation domain was fused to the N - terminus of full - length PPAR delta, under control of the 2. 2 - kb human alpha - skeletal actin promoter.

In agreement with the chronic effects in the transgenic mice, we found that, after treatment of wild - type C57B6J mice with the PPAR delta - specific agonist GW501516 for only 10 d, genes for slow fiber contractile proteins, mitochondrial biogenesis, and beta - oxidation were all upregulated ( Figure 3E).

The antibody also recognized a band corresponding to the size of endogenous Snail ( approximately 28 kDa) in lysates from embryonic mouse skin, the temporal appearance of which corresponded to the waves of hair follicle morphogenesis from E15. 5 to newborn when over 90% of the hair on the mouse is formed ( Figure 1B).

The observed differences in neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth between precocious and isochronic expression of EWS - Pea3 prompted us to perform a direct comparative analysis of gene expression between mice with precocious EWS - Pea3 expression and mice in which the expression of EWS - Pea3 is initiated in DRG sensory neurons from the time of normal onset of Er81 expression.

In addition, laminin - 2 is a key player in peripheral myelin formation, because laminin - 2 deficiency causes dysmyelination in mice and humans, and its receptors, alpha - 6 beta - 1 integrin and dystroglycan, are also shown to be deeply involved in myelin formation [ 26, 27].

Sam68 transcripts encoded by exons 1 to 5 were absent as evidenced by RT - PCR ( Dataset S2), and Sam68 - / - mice were devoid of Sam68 protein, as visualized by immunoblotting with anti - Sam68 AD1 and SC - 333 antibodies or control normal rabbit serum or anti - Sam68 AD1 preabsorbed with peptide ( Figure 2C).

Src null animals are known to have bone metabolism defects [ 48], and since Sam68 is a substrate of Src, we decided to analyze the Sam68 mice for skeletal abnormalities.

Similar reductions in trabecular bone were shown by Faxitron and micro - CT in the fifth lumbar vertebrae of the 12 - month - old Sam68 + / + mice but not in the Sam68 - / - mice ( unpublished data).

In effect, this meant that there were fewer trabeculae, rather than equivalent numbers of thin trabeculae, in the 12 - month - old Sam68 + / + mice compared with any of the other groups of mice.

ALP - and TRAP - positive cells were reduced in the 12 - month - old Sam68 + / + mice ( Figure 5E and 5F) and remained unchanged in 12 - month - old Sam68 - / - mice ( Figure 5G and 5H).

Bone volume ( BV / TV), newly formed osteoid ( OV / TV), and mineral apposition rate ( MAR) were all significantly reduced in 12 - month - old Sam68 + / + mice compared with 4 - month - old Sam68 + / + mice.

These results were in contrast to those of the 12 - month - old Sam68 - / - mice in which all histomorphometric parameters, including marrow fat, resembled those of young mice of either genotype ( Table 3).

Cultures of bone marrow stromal cells harvested from 4 - week - old Sam68 - / - mice and maintained for 18 days in osteoblast differentiation medium demonstrated more intense staining for ALP at 6 days ( unpublished data) and 18 days ( Figure 6A), and more mineralized nodules at 18 days, than the Sam68 + / + mice, even though similar amounts of fibroblast colony - forming units ( CFU - F) were observed ( Figure 6A and unpublished data).

RT - PCR analysis of molecular markers of osteoblast differentiation ( Dataset S2) revealed similar increases over time in RNA from Sam68 + / + and Sam68 - / - mice, although type I collagen appeared to be up - regulated at both timepoints in the Sam68 - / - mice.

These findings suggest that the osteoclasts may not be the primary defect in Sam68 - / - mice, as they are in Src null mice [ 48].

The wild - type littermates underwent age - related bone loss that occurs naturally in mammals, while the Sam68 - / - animals preserved their bone mass with aging.

The Sam68 - / - mice were generated using a traditional targeting approach where the functional KH domain was deleted and approximately one third of the Sam68 - / - mice survived to adulthood with no apparent defects.

The skeletal phenotyping of cohorts of Sam68 + / + and Sam68 - / - mice showed that bone mass was preserved in aged Sam68 - / - mice.

Ex vivo differentiation of primary bone marrow stromal cells, harvested from Sam68 + / + and Sam68 - / - mice, down the osteoblast lineage revealed an osteogenic advantage in the cultures of cells derived from the Sam68 - / - mice.

Our findings that aged Sam68 - / - mice do not develop fatty bone marrow and that MEFs derived from Sam68 - / - mice have impaired adipocyte differentiation, indicate that Sam68 regulates both adipocyte and osteoblast differentiation.

The fact that osteoblast function is altered in Src - / - mice [ 60, 61] raises the possibility that preservation of bone mass in the Sam68 - / - mice could be linked with and regulated by Src.

The lowering of leptin levels in aged Sam68 - / - mice is consistent with these mice having a high bone mass compared with their aged littermates.

These data would suggest that the leptin - sympathetic pathway is unaltered in Sam68 - / - mice and that the lowering of leptin may explain the lower levels of CTX in the serum of Sam68 - / - mice.

Disruption of the mouse Capn4 gene abolished both mu - calpain and m - calpain activity, and resulted in embryonic lethality, thereby suggesting essential roles for one or both of these enzymes during mammalian embryogenesis.

Disruption of the Capn1 gene produced viable, fertile mice implying that either m - calpain could compensate for the loss of mu - calpain, or that the loss of m - calpain was responsible for death of Capn4 - / - mice.

The different times of embryonic lethality suggested that the first reported Capn4 - / - mice [ 31] were targeted with a hypomorphic mutation, which retained some small level of calpain activity, allowing for their survival to mid - gestation, while the second reported Capn4 - / - mice [ 32] represented a true null mutation.

To gain further insights into the potential roles of BMP signaling in vertebrate limb patterning and skeletogenesis, we have produced mice simultaneously lacking BMP2 and BMP4 activity or BMP2 and BMP7 activity in the limb mesechyme during limb development.

Similarly, limb skeletons of mice in which both copies of the Bmp4 gene and one copy of the Bmp2 gene have been conditionally removed in the limb ( Bmp2 + / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre) are phenotypically normal other than exhibiting the variable penetrance preaxial and postaxial polydactyly seen in mice deficient in BMP4 activity alone ( Figure 1J and 1R).

However, one of the striking defects observed in the Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre mice is that in the newborn animals, the digits of both forelimb ( unpublished data) and hindlimb show complete syndactyly ( Figure 2D; compare to wild - type, Figure 2C).

However, Bmp7 expression does not overlap with Bmp2 in the early mouse limb bud [ 45], and in any case, mice in which we conditionally knocked out Bmp2 in the Bmp7 - / - background do not show any obvious digit patterning defect other than the missing final phalanx in digit III.

We do know, however, that osteogenesis is defective in these mice, although bone formation proceeds normally in siblings retaining one functional copy of either the Bmp2 or Bmp4 gene ( Figure S4), as it does in mice completely deficient in BMP2 and BMP7 ( Figures 1 and S2).

In Pygo2 - / - mice, there was a significant loss of reporter expression ( data not shown), and double - homozygous mutants showed loss of X - gal staining in the paramesonephric ducts ( Figure 6K), whereas Pygo1 - / - / Pygo2 + / - and Pygo1 + / - / Pygo2 + / - mice showed normal levels of BAT - gal expression ( Figure 6G, H, J).

Given these results in Drosophila, the relatively mild phenotypes of mice with targeted Pygo1, Pygo2, or double Pygo1 / Pygo2 mutations were striking.

In Drosophila, the Pygopus gene is often required for canonical Wnt signaling, while in mammals the Pygo1 / Pygo2 genes appear to play a smaller role in canonical Wnt signaling.

Assuming that the Pygopus genes in mammals are dedicated to canonical Wnt signaling, as has been previously shown in Drosophila, the genes with expression differences represent candidate Wnt targets ( direct or indirect) in kidney development.

In addition, because it is found in all branches of mammals, but not in other vertebrates, Dmrt7 may shed light on evolution of meiosis and of sex chromatin.

For example, there is a higher failure rate for meiosis in females, with human oocyte aneuploidy rates up to 25% versus about 2% in human sperm [ 3], and this may indicate that the checkpoints controlling and monitoring the events of meiotic progression in males are more stringent.

Dmrt7 is expressed only in the gonad, and, unlike the other Dmrt genes, appears to be present exclusively in mammals and not in nonmammalian vertebrates [ 23, 36].

Although Dmrt7 belongs to an ancient and conserved gene family, it is found only in mammals, and to our knowledge DMRT7 is the only example of a mammal - specific protein that is essential for meiosis.

Recombination, which repairs repair double strand breaks ( DSBs) that are genetically induced in leptonema, is coupled with synapsis in budding yeast and mammals.

PCH2, encoding a nucleolar - localized AAA - ATPase that was originally identified in an S. cerevisiae genetic screen for mutants that relieve pachytene arrest of asynaptic zip1 mutants [ 8], was recently determined to be an essential component of the pachytene synapsis ( but not DSB repair) checkpoint in yeast and worms [ 2, 12].

SPO11 is a transesterase that is essential for the creation of genetically programmed DSB during leptonema of many organisms, including mice [ 18].

Identical studies were performed with mice deficient for Mei1, a vertebrate - specific gene also required for DSB formation and chromosome synapsis [ 37], with similar results ( Figure 3J and 3K; immunocytology not shown).

Of these four genes, SAE2 and ZIP1 do not have clear mammalian orthologs ( although SYCP1 may be a functional ortholog of ZIP1), and mutation of the mouse RAD17 ortholog, Rad1, presumably causes embryonic lethality [ 42].

Thus, mutational analysis of mouse Pch2 ( Trip13), which is also critical for the synapsis checkpoint in C. elegans [ 2], was the best remaining option to evaluate potential functional conservation in mammalian meiotic checkpoint control.

One possible candidate is Dot1 ( PCH1 in yeast), a histone methyltransferase silencing factor that is required for pachytene arrest of zip1 and dmc1 mutants in yeast [ 58], and for preventing RAD54 - mediated recombinational DSB repair between sister chromatids.

As alluded to earlier, a complicating problem for studying potential meiotic checkpoint genes in mice is that as in yeast, such genes often have mitotic functions ( such as RAD24 [ 7]), and their ablation can cause lethality [ 42].
