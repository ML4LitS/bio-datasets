In BC individuals the correlation with CEBPG was significantly ( p < 0. 01) lower than that of non - BC individuals for four of the genes ( XRCC1, ERCC5, GSTP1, and SOD1) and the difference was nearly significant for GPX1.	individuals,6,17,Organism	individuals,104,115,Organism	"[{""token"": ""individuals"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""individuals"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test

For XRCC1, ERCC5, GSTP1, and SOD1 the correlation with CEBPG was significantly lower in BC individuals compared to non - BC individuals and the difference was nearly significant for GPX1 ( Fig. 1b).	individuals,91,102,Organism	individuals,124,135,Organism	"[{""token"": ""individuals"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""individuals"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test

For example, the non - BC individual and BC individual groups are not perfectly matched with respect to age, gender or smoking history ( Table 1) and each of these factors could contribute to the observed difference in correlation between groups.	individual,26,36,Organism	individual,44,54,Organism	"[{""token"": ""individual"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""individual"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
Another possible explanation is that any differences in NBEC from BC individuals compared to non - BC individuals resulted from development of BC, instead of being a hereditary cause of increased risk for cancer.	individuals,69,80,Organism	individuals,102,113,Organism	"[{""token"": ""individuals"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""individuals"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
Among the matched heaviest smokers, it is expected that CEBPG will be significantly correlated with each of the antioxidant or DNA repair genes among the non - BC individuals but not correlated in BC individuals.	individuals,163,174,Organism	individuals,200,211,Organism	"[{""token"": ""individuals"", ""start_span"": 163, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""individuals"", ""start_span"": 200, ""end_span"": 211, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test

Filter trap analysis of line 18 tTA / APP mice yielded similar results: the increase in aggregated A beta observed in untreated animals between 6 and 9 mo of age was completely arrested by transgene suppression ( Figure S5C and S5D).	mice,42,46,Organism	animals,128,135,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
In fact, levels of PBS - soluble A beta 40 and A beta 42 in the 6 mo + 3 mo and 6 mo + 6 mo treated cohorts were most similar to that of the 9 mo untreated cohort, suggesting that age, as opposed to synthetic rate ( which would be negligible in the treated animals), may determine the fraction of PBS - soluble A beta in these animals.	animals,257,264,Organism	animals,327,334,Organism	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 257, ""end_span"": 264, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 327, ""end_span"": 334, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test

In interpreting our study, it should be remembered that the earliest plaques to appear in these mice, like other APP transgenics harboring the Swedish mutation [ 27], are predominantly fibrillar deposits, which may be less tractable than the diffuse aggregates thought to come first in the course of the human disease.	mice,96,100,Organism	human,304,309,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 304, ""end_span"": 309, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test

Somewhat paradoxically, several studies further demonstrate that treatment with anti - inflammatory drugs to reduce microglial activation actually lowers amyloid load in APP transgenic mice, suggesting a role for mouse microglia in the formation and maintenance of amyloid aggregates [ 41 - 43].	mice,185,189,Organism	mouse,213,218,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 185, ""end_span"": 189, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 213, ""end_span"": 218, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
