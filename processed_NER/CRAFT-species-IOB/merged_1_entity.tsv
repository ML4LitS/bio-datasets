During the preparation of this manuscript, Lin et al. reported an independent mouse line in which the PGC - 1 alpha gene was targeted [ 37].	mouse,78,83,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	train
First, in contrast to Lin et al., the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice described here do not exhibit any postnatal mortality.	mice,58,62,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	train
In addition, whereas Lin et al. found an abnormal expression profile forCCAAT - enhancer - binding protein beta and delta and the gluconeogenic genes encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose - 6 - phosphatase at baseline and with fasting in the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice, we did not ( unpublished data).	mice,279,283,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 279, ""end_span"": 283, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	train
Third, we found evidence for an age - related increase in body fat in PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice ( females earlier than males), whereas Lin et al. identified a male - specific resistance to diet - induced obesity and insulin resistance.	mice,90,94,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	train
We have also found that male PGC - 1 alpha - deficient mice are somewhat protected against diet - induced obesity ( Figure S4).	mice,55,59,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	train
However, we observed that the insulin - sensitive phenotype of the female PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice occurred in the context of normal weight gain with high - fat diet.	mice,94,98,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	train

However, it should be noted that we did not study activity levels over an extended period of time in males as did Lin et al., so it is possible that our findings reflect an emotional disturbance that manifests only when the animals are placed in a new environment.	animals,224,231,Organism	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 224, ""end_span"": 231, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	train

In addition, the incompletely penetrant postnatal mortality noted in the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice reported by Lin et al. could have resulted in a selection bias toward greater levels of compensatory responses in liver and other tissues in the surviving group.	mice,93,97,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	train

Genes such as Msx2 ( Figure 3N) continue to be expressed throughout the posterior forelimb mesenchyme, indicating that the posterior forelimb tissue is viable at E12. 5 in the Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre animals.	animals,209,216,Organism	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 209, ""end_span"": 216, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	train
The loss of the posterior forelimb digits in these mice thus does not appear to represent a decrease in polarizing activity leading to a change in digit identity rather a consequence of the overall level of BMP signaling falling below a threshold for initiating chondrogenesis in the posterior of these forelimbs.	mice,51,55,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	train
The skeletal elements in these various BMP - deficient animals contained normal prehypertrophic chondrocytes expressing type II collagen, hypertrophic chondrocytes expressing type X collagen, as well as the osteoblasts expressing type I collagen, like their wild - type counterparts ( Figure S2; compare Figure S2F - S2H with Figure S2B - S2D; and unpublished data).	animals,55,62,Organism	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	train
To differentiate between a simple delay in bone formation in the absence of BMP2 and BMP4 and the inability to form bone without these BMPs, we performed histological analyses in Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre mice up to 3 wks of age.	mice,212,216,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 212, ""end_span"": 216, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	train

In the control mice, osteoblasts lining the surface of trabecular and cortical bone express type I collagen, runx2, and osterix genes at both 1 wk and 3 wks after birth ( Figure 7A - 7D and 7I - 7L).	mice,15,19,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	train
Compensation by BMPs in the AER also likely explains a difference seen between the Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre mice in our experiments and a recently published analysis [ 16], which used the identical Bmp4 conditional allele and Prx1:: cre driver.	mice,105,109,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	train

Their mice, therefore, lost a half - dose of BMP4 from the AER in addition to complete loss in the mesenchyme, while our conditional alleles were only recombined in the mesenchyme by the Prx1:: cre driver.	mice,6,10,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	train

We investigated further the effects of genes from the C57BL / 6 background by repeating the linkage analysis in ( 129 x C57BL / 6) F2 mice, whilst controlling for the very strong 129 effect on distal Chromosome 1, as previously described ( Zeng 1994).	mice,134,138,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test

By comparing this Chromosome 1 congenic strain with matched congenic mice lacking the Apcs gene, we demonstrated that serum amyloid P component deficiency influences the severity of glomerulonephritis, but is not the prime mover in the induction of anti - nuclear autoimmunity, contrary to our own original interpretation of our data ( Bickerstaff et al. 1999).	mice,69,73,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test

Furthermore, the region on Chromosome 7 associated with the development of lupus nephritis has been linked to the same trait in other murine models of SLE ( Santiago et al. 1998; Morel et al. 1999; Xie et al. 2002), suggesting the possibility of shared susceptibility loci.	murine,134,140,Organism	"[{""token"": ""murine"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
In the context of SLE susceptibility, one of the most consistently mapped non - MHC regions of the mouse genome is the telomeric Chromosome 1 segment, where several disease loci, designated Sle1 ( Morel et al. 2001), Nba2 ( Drake et al. 1995; Rozzo et al. 1996; Vyse et al. 1997), and Bxs3 ( Hogarth et al. 1998), have been mapped in lupus - prone strains.	mouse,99,104,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test

We have previously reported that ( 129 x C57BL / 6).

A possible explanation for this discrepancy may lie in the fact that the Apcs - / - mice analysed in the original study were generated from a limited number of founders and that this may have caused a nonrandom inheritance of the loci from the parental strains.	mice,84,88,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
In agreement with this, when we carried out a selective comparison between the ( 129 x C57BL / 6) F2.

In support of this, the expression of the human C - reactive protein, an acute - phase protein closely related to Apcs, has been shown to delay the onset and severity of lupus nephritis in the NZB / W strain by preventing the deposition of immune complexes in the renal cortex ( Szalai et al. 2003).	human,42,47,Organism	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test

New lines of transgenic mice were developed for this study that express high levels of APPswe / ind under the control of a tetracycline - responsive promoter.	mice,24,28,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
Transgenic expression of APPswe / ind and consequent overproduction of A beta 42 cause early - onset amyloid deposition in untreated mice, in which deposits appear as early as 2 mo of age.	mice,133,137,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
Amyloid burden worsens significantly with age, and by 9 mo, the hippocampus and cortex of untreated mice are largely filled with aggregated peptide.	mice,100,104,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
Importantly, this outcome occurs in animals already harboring considerable amyloid pathology, a situation similar to what might be expected in patients to be treated with secretase inhibitors.	animals,36,43,Organism	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
Two independent compounds tested in Tg2576 [ 33] and TgCRND8 [ 34] transgenic mice show no more than 85% suppression of A beta 40 levels, and where measured, even less suppression of A beta 42 ( approximately 60%) [ 35, 36].	mice,78,82,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
Thus, even after accounting for the much higher APP expression levels in our mice than in the Tg2576 and TgCRND8 lines, we have achieved better absolute suppression of A beta production with the tet - off system than is currently possible with published gamma - secretase inhibitors.	mice,77,81,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
We examined a small number of animals after 12 mo of dox treatment ( beginning at 6 mo of age), and found that amyloid deposits were still relatively abundant.	animals,30,37,Organism	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
At the latest treatment interval analyzed by ELISA, animals administered dox for 6 mo showed elevated levels of PBS - soluble A beta ( see Figure 5) that could be interpreted as an indication that the plaques are slowly releasing peptide ( or oligomeric A beta) into the soluble pool and might eventually dissolve.	animals,52,59,Organism	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
However, our data suggest that once diffuse deposits are formed in these mice, they are no more easily cleared in our system than cored plaques ( see Figure S4).	mice,73,77,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
An additional consideration we recognize is that a small amount of transgene expression continues in the presence of dox and that endogenous mouse A beta continues to be produced.	mouse,141,146,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
However, these low levels of peptide are not sufficient to induce new amyloid formation, as CaMKII alpha - tTA x tetAPPswe / ind mice raised on dox for up to a year do not develop amyloid lesions ( data not shown).	mice,129,133,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
It is also clear that in this genetic system, we have raised the production of A beta to levels not found in humans to accelerate pathology into an experimentally feasible time frame.	humans,109,115,Organism	"[{""token"": ""humans"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
Resident microglia in transgenic mouse models localize to tissue surrounding plaques but show little evidence of amyloid engulfment [ 37 - 40].	mouse,33,38,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
In contrast, microglia surrounding amyloid plaques in human brain show a much higher state of activation with greater expression of complement receptor [ 40].	human,54,59,Organism	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
Thus, the role of microglia in amyloid metabolism is minor in transgenic models compared to the human condition.	human,96,101,Organism	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
Even so, we considered the possibility that chronic dox treatment may have altered the activation state of microglia in our treated mice.	mice,132,136,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
However, if dox does have anti - inflammatory activity, then, based on previous studies with other anti - inflammatories, we would have expected to find less amyloid in the dox - treated animals.	animals,187,194,Organism	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 187, ""end_span"": 194, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
While it is possible that dox acts in some other way to slow amyloid clearance, data from multiple studies demonstrate that microglial responses are normally weak in the mouse AD models [ 37 - 40], and thus it is doubtful that dox - mediated microglial inhibition affected the outcome of our study.	mouse,170,175,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 170, ""end_span"": 175, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test

However, it has been noted that deletion of the Fc receptor ( the primary receptor for microglial opsinization of antibody - antigen complexes) in APP transgenic mouse models has no impact on the effectiveness of antibody - mediated therapy [ 56, 57].	mouse,162,167,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 162, ""end_span"": 167, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
It is, nevertheless, possible that lack of microglia activation is the major difference between the slow clearance described here, where no perturbation of the immune system is expected, and the rapid clearance described in studies involving antibody or viral injection.	viral,254,259,Organism	"[{""token"": ""viral"", ""start_span"": 254, ""end_span"": 259, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
Consistent with this hypothesis, strong activation of microglia through transgenic expression of TGF beta [ 58] or central injection of lipopolysaccharide [ 59, 60] can by itself substantially reduce plaque burden in APP transgenic mice.	mice,232,236,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 232, ""end_span"": 236, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
As in our tet - off APP mice, SantaCruz et al. found that tau neurofibrillary tangles, like amyloid plaques, are not cleared efficiently following transgene suppression.	mice,24,28,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
The lack of clearance in both models of AD pathology comes as a stark contrast to the rapid removal of protein aggregates found in similar tet - off mouse models of Huntington [ 32] and prion disease [ 62].	mouse,149,154,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 149, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test

Even at later stages in the disease, the presence of substantial microglial activation in human AD [ 40] suggests that simply slowing the formation of new amyloid deposits may allow ongoing phagocytosis to diminish preexisting lesions.	human,90,95,Organism	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test

The photopic response in E2f1 KO mice was slightly reduced relative to WT ( Figure S5B), possibly because E2f1 is required for maximal expansion of embryonic RPCs, and the E2f1 KO retina has, as noted earlier, slightly fewer cells than the WT retina, although cell type proportions are unaffected ( D.
