The purpose of this study was to determine the IOPs of genetically distinct mouse strains, assess the effects of factors such as age, sex and time of day on IOP in specific strain backgrounds, and to assess the effects of specific candidate gene mutations on IOP.

The initial experiments demonstrated that in our hands careful ocular cannulation has a very minor effect on IOP ( average of - 0. 3 mmHg, mode - 0. 5 mmHg) and demonstrated significant differences in intraocular pressure levels between four mouse strains.

Average IOP for age matched mice of the same strain assessed at different times typically differed by no more than 1. 5 mmHg, and the differences were usually smaller.	"mice	28	32	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The sex [ Male ( M) or Female ( F)], age ( months), and number of mice ( n) analyzed for the CBA strains are listed starting with the earliest measurement and ending with the latest: CBA / CaJ, F, n = 22, age 6 - 7; M, n = 11, age 2; CBA / CaHN, F, n = 16, age 3; M, n = 8, age 3.

The number of mice analyzed at each time follows: BALB / cJ 8, 10, 11, 15, 18 and 14, C57BL / 6J 10, 14, 21, 40, 40 and 42.	"mice	14	18	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The IOPs of BALB / cJ mice ( low end of spectrum) were very similar for the past several years, around 11 mmHg.	"mice	22	26	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The increased IOP in A / J also was reproducible, with the average IOP of mice assessed in the year 2000 being 14. 5 +/- 0. 4 mmHg ( n = 16).	"mice	74	78	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
For example, control mice analyzed at the same time as the 3 month, 12 month and 18 month B6 age groups had IOPs of 13. 0 +/- 0. 2 mmHg ( n = 14), 13. 3 +/- 0. 2 mmHg ( n = 14), 13. 7 +/- 0. 4 mmHg ( n = 12), respectively.	"mice	21	25	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
IOP was even lower in the 24 month B6 mice ( 10. 8 +/- 0. 4 mmHg), and again the average IOP of young controls measured at the same time was not changed ( 13. 5 +/- 0. 2, n = 12).	"mice	38	42	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The 3 months old C3H / HeJ mice were male while the other ages were composed of males and females.	"mice	27	31	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The number of mice analyzed at each age, listed from youngest to oldest, follow: C57BL / 6J, 18, 18, 18, 18, 13; 129P3 / J, 18, 15, 16, 14, 21; C3H / HeJ, 15, 23 17 and 16.	"mice	14	18	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In strain 129P3 / J, IOP did not differ significantly with age between 3 and 14 months but was lower in 18 month old mice ( P < 0. 001 compared to all younger ages, Figure 4).	"mice	117	121	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Despite a 1 mmHg dip in IOP at 8 months, there were no significant IOP differences between C3H / HeJ mice at each age tested ( P = 0. 2 for age).	"mice	101	105	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
If real, this sporadic sex difference was not dependent on age, sometimes occurring in a group of B6 mice at a particular age and sometimes not occurring in a separate group of the same age.

Initial experiments suggested that an almost identical dose ( 100 mg / kg ketamine and 9 mg / kg xylazine) of anesthesia had no effect on IOP during the experimental period with IOP being measured as soon as possible after the mouse was unconscious, typically minutes.	"mouse	227	232	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 227, ""end_span"": 232, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
To further assess the effects of anesthesia, we measured IOP in groups of genetically identical B6 mice subjected to different doses ( 1X, 1. 5X and 2X) at 5 and 25 minutes after administration ( Figure 5).

To identify any early window when it may be possible to assess IOP without an obvious anesthetic effect, 195 mice of strain B6 were anesthetized with the 1X dose and IOP was measured at 1 minute time points between 4 and 12 minutes after administration ( Figure 5).

To test if deficiency of carbonic anhydrase II leads to decreased IOP, we analyzed mice of a B6 background that were genetically similar but with normal or mutant alleles of the Car2 gene [ 25, 26].

To test if genetic perturbations that cause obesity and diabetes can alter IOP, we compared mice that were genetically similar but were either homozygous or heterozygous for a leptin receptor mutation ( db) that results in obesity and diabetes before 4 months of age on the C57BLKS / J strain background used [ 27].

The albino mice were homozygous and coisogenic for a mutant allele of tyrosinase ( Tyrc - 2J) that arose on the otherwise pigmented B6 background.	"mice	11	15	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

The time 0 measurement in that study was at a very similar state of anesthesia as our 4 and 5 minute time points ( starting as soon as possible and within 20 to 60 seconds of adequate anesthesia), and the 5 minute rat time point was similar to our 9 and 10 minute measurement times.

Of possible relevance, we previously reported that female mice of strains DBA / 2J and AKXD - 28 / Ty develop elevated IOP at an earlier age than males [ 14, 19].	"mice	58	62	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

While the experimental design of these experiments was somewhat different from that of Moyna - han et al [ 24], the results raise the possibility that CAPAN - 1 cells have more than one mutation that lowers the efficiency of recombinational repair relative to that observed in other human cell lines.

Furthermore, the discrepancy between the 100 - fold difference between CAPAN - 1 and the other human lines as compared with the fivefold to sixfold difference between the Brca2lex1 / lex2cells and Brca2 + / + ES cells might simply be accounted for by the fact that Brca2lex1 / lex2 is not a null allele.

Even though our RFP transgenic ES cell lines failed to maintain strong uniform expression with in vitro passage, we selected three lines exhibiting the most robust expression for making chimeras, in order to ascertain whether we could achieve, or possibly recover, RFP expression in animals.

Since we were unable to obtain ES cells, embryos or mice with widespread expression of a RFP ( DsRed1) we conclude that this reporter is not developmentally neutral or that its expression cannot be sustained at levels high enough for detection, and as such is not as versatile as other gene - based fluorescent reporters.

This signal was very strong over hair cells of the P0 control animals ( Fig. 8b).	"animals	62	69	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The BDNF signal in the utricle was clearly centered on the hair cells in the control animal but some aggregation of silver grains appeared also in the Brn3c null mutants ( data not shown).

A strong BDNF signal was found over the hair cells of control animals and an occasional immature hair cell also showed a BDNF signal in the Brn3c null mutants.	"animals	62	69	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The NT - 3 signal in the area of the cochlea that corresponds to the IHC ' s persisted at least until P8 in the apex of Brn3c null mice ( Fig. 9e, 9f).	"mice	131	135	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We will explore five points in this discussion: How the limited expression of neurotrophins relates to the apparent survival of primary neurons until P8; how the known absence of apical hair cells and of classical neurotrophins can be related to the presence of large numbers of apical turn spiral neurons; how absence of differentiated hair cells affects afferent and efferent targeting; and how these data possibly relate to other mutant animals and to children born with profound hearing loss.	"animals	440	447	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 440, ""end_span"": 447, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
For example, in BDNF heterozygotic animals there is a small decrease in the number of sensory neurons in the ear [ 13] but no change in the overall pattern of innervation.	"animals	35	42	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We suggest that limited expression of neurotrophins in the immature target leads to retention of primary neurons and their afferent fibers in newborn and early postnatal Brn3c null mice.	"mice	181	185	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 181, ""end_span"": 185, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This expression of NT - 3 in supporting cells in embryos and neonates may even preserve in Brn3c null mutants the numerous spiral sensory neurons in the apex of 8 - day old animals ( Figs. 3, 4).

However, known neurotrophins are largely absent in the adult cochleae [ 4] and significant amounts of neurotrophin expression appear to develop only in postnatal animals in the CNS [ 24].

In this context, it would be interesting to see whether the recently generated transgenic mouse in which BDNF is expressed under NT - 3 promoter control [ 33] could actually perform an even more pronounced rescue in a Brn3c null mutant background.

When combined with another olfactory receptor degenerate primer, P26 [ 17], this primer preferentially amplifies class I olfactory receptors from mouse genomic DNA: of 33 sequenced, cloned PCR products, 17 represented seven different class I olfactory receptors, six represented three different class II olfactory receptors, and ten represented five different non - olfactory receptor contaminants.

We were intrigued both by previous reports of splicing of human olfactory receptors near the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC) cluster, where several genes splice over long distances to a common upstream exon [ 26, 27] and by the idea that olfactory receptor transcriptional control could be achieved by DNA recombination mechanisms, perhaps with the result that transcripts would contain some sequence from another locus.

Mutations in either of two genes comprising the STSL locus, ATP - binding cassette ( ABC) - transporters ABCG5 ( encoding sterolin - 1) and ABCG8 ( encoding sterolin - 2), result in sitosterolemia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder of sterol trafficking characterized by increased plasma plant sterol levels.

Since biliary sitosterol secretion is preserved, although not elevated in the sitosterolemic mice, this observation suggests that mechanisms other than by Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 may be responsible for its secretion into bile.

A typical western diet contains relatively equal amounts of cholesterol and non - cholesterol sterols, mainly plant sterols, of which about 55% of the dietary cholesterol is absorbed and retained compared to ~ 1% of the dietary non - cholesterol sterols [ 1 - 3].

Sitosterolemic patients have diagnostically elevated plasma plant sterol levels ( for example, sitosterol, campesterol, stigmasterol, and avenosterol, etc.) and their 5 - saturated stanol metabolites, particularly sitostanol, with normal or only moderately increased cholesterol levels.

Clinical studies have shown that affected individuals hyperabsorb all dietary sterols ( thus have lost the ability to restrict the sterol species absorbed) and have lost the ability to excrete sterols into bile [ 8, 9].

However, it is important to point out that the human disease is caused by complete mutation in one or the other gene, but not both simultaneously.	"human	47	52	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

Although not quantitative, Northern analyses showed that while the knockout mice showed no detectable mRNA for Abcg8, expression of Abcg5 appeared unaltered ( Figure 1c).	"mice	76	80	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
To exclude the possibility of alternative splicing with the production of a non - functional but truncated Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 protein that may serve as a chaperone for Abcg5 / sterolin - 1, RT - PCR was performed on cDNA reverse transcribed from total liver RNA from Abcg8 - deficient mice.	"mice	287	291	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 287, ""end_span"": 291, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
No mRNA for Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 was detected containing any sequences downstream of exon 4 in the Abcg8 - deficient mice, whether primers were located in exons 4 and 13, exons 9 and 13 or exons 10 and 13 ( Figure 1d, 1e).

Liver cholesterol content of the Abcg8 - / - mice was reduced by ~ 50% relative to wild - type liver ( 1202 +/- 264 mu g / g wet weight tissue, versus 2280 +/- 310 mu g / g wet weight tissue, respectively).

To investigate the effects of a deficiency of Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 on the genes that regulate sterol metabolism, quantitative RT - PCR was performed looking at the expression levels of Abcg5, Abcg8, Hmgr, Cyp7a1, Abca1, Mdr2, Lxr, Srebp - 1c, and Srebp - 2 mRNA in the livers of mice fed a regular chow diet ( Figure 4a).	"mice	279	283	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 279, ""end_span"": 283, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
HMG - CoA reductase activity was reduced by 30% and 60% in the Abcg8 + / - and Abcg8 - / - mice, respectively ( Figure 4b), and thus reflected the changes in mRNA expression.	"mice	91	95	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

To further confirm that Abcg5 / sterolin - 1 expression is preserved and may be apical, immunohistochemistry was performed in Amsterdam using the AMC antibody to stain liver sections from wild - type and knockout mice [ 30].

Biliary secretion of bile salts, sterol and phospholipids in Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 deficient mice	"mice	92	96	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We analyzed the knockout mice for any alterations in biliary sterol handling.	"mice	25	29	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
To investigate whether the defect in biliary sterol secretion could be ( partly) restored by forced biliary sterol secretion, we infused mice with stepwise increasing doses of tauroursodeoxycholic acid ( TUDC).	"mice	137	141	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Mice were first depleted of their endogenous bile salt pools for 90 min and subsequently infused via the jugular vein with increasing doses of TUDC.	"Mice	0	4	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Mice"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In the heterozygous mice, sterol secretion increased to reach a maximal level of about 50% of the wild type suggesting that Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 is a rate - limiting step for biliary ' cholesterol ' secretion.	"mice	20	24	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In the knockout mice, sterol secretion remained at a constant level during the depletion phase and increased minimally upon infusion of TUDC.	"mice	16	20	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Since the Abcg8 - / - mice still secreted some sterols we were interested in which biliary sterol species were being secreted.	"mice	22	26	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Therefore bile was collected from mice during a constant infusion of TUDC and analyzed by GC.	"mice	34	38	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

Identification of the genetic defect ( s) in a rare human disorder, sitosterolemia, where these processes are specifically disrupted, may finally have led to the identification of the ' transporters ' responsible for these processes.

We report a mouse model of sitosterolemia, with a selective, but complete, defect in one of these genes, Abcg8.	"mouse	12	17	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Homozygous knockout mice are viable, fertile and sitosterolemic.	"mice	20	24	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, fertility seems to be reduced when homozygous mice are bred together ( S Patel and J Oatis, unpublished observation).	"mice	55	59	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This model reflects many other observed changes described in limited studies in humans.	"humans	80	86	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""humans"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
For example, in humans, the activity of HMG - CoA reductase and CYP7a1 have been reported to be low [ 7, 39].	"humans	16	22	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""humans"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In this study, we show that the mRNA and enzyme activities in the livers from knockout animals are also significantly reduced.	"animals	87	94	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Measurement of biliary sterol secretion rates in Abcg8 - / - mice demonstrated a failure to increase sterol secretion into bile despite exogenous infusion of bile acids.	"mice	61	65	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Arguably, since the body pools and plasma sitosterol levels in the knockout mice are so considerably elevated, perhaps the biliary sitosterol levels could be considered to be inappropriately low.	"mice	76	80	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Despite this reservation, the finding that sitosterol is present in the bile suggests that plant sterols may be secreted independent of Abcg8 / sterolin - 2.	"plant	91	96	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""plant"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Collectively these data suggest that Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 is necessary for hepatobiliary cholesterol secretion in mice.	"mice	114	118	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Their phenotypic features are very similar to those recently reported for a mouse deficient in both sterolins simultaneously [ 7, 20].	"mouse	76	81	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Plasma and hepatic plant sterol levels in Abcg8 - / - and Abcg5 / Abcg8 knockout are increased similarly with marked decreases in cholesterol levels.	"plant	19	24	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""plant"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The basis for this is not clear at present, unless the increase in non - plant sterols leads to a suppression of SREBP activation.	"plant	73	78	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""plant"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In preliminary studies, when knockout mice are placed on a low sitosterol diet, the activity of this enzyme, as well as the mRNA levels are increased ( E Klett and S Patel, unpublished observations).	"mice	38	42	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 deficient mice also allow us to examine the role of this protein in biliary sterol secretion.	"mice	31	35	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Thus, Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 is necessary for cholesterol secretion but not necessary for plant sterol secretion.	"plant	88	93	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""plant"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Recently, Kosters et al. reported that Abcg5 / Abcg8 mRNA expression in a variety of different mouse strains correlated with biliary cholesterol secretion rates [ 30].	"mouse	95	100	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In their studies, although diosgenin - fed mice showed a marked increase in biliary cholesterol output, mRNA levels of Abcg5 and Abcg8 were not altered.	"mice	43	47	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
While biliary cholesterol secretion is not completely absent in the Abcg8 - deficient mice it would appear that sterolin - 2 plays a major role in this process.	"mice	86	90	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Thus, there is support for at least four loci that may be involved in regulating plasma plant sterol levels.	"plant	88	93	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""plant"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In experiments shown here, using three separately developed anti - Abcg5 / sterolin - 1 antibodies, we have obtained inconsistent data regarding the trafficking of Abcg5 / sterolin - 1 in Abcg8 - / - mice.	"mice	200	204	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 200, ""end_span"": 204, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Based upon classical N - glycosylation maturation it would appear that Abcg5 / sterolin - 1, in the Abcg8 - / - mice, does not exit the endoplasmic reticulum.	"mice	112	116	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, by immunohistochemistry it appears that Abcg5 / sterolin - 1 is apically expressed in the Abcg8 - deficient mice regardless of the anti - Abcg5 / sterolin - 1 antibody used.	"mice	117	121	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Interestingly, in a report of Abcg5 / Abcg8 localization in canine gallbladder epithelial cells, these two proteins were found intracellularly under baseline conditions [ 44].	"canine	60	66	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""canine"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In a recent paper, Mangrivite et al. showed that the apical sorting of rat SPNT in polarized renal epithelial cells was independent of N - glycosylation [ 45].	"rat	71	74	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""rat"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Therefore, at this time, we can neither exclude the possibility that Abcg5 / sterolin - 1 expression is functional in our Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 deficient mice nor can we rule it out.	"mice	153	157	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
More extensive fractionation experiments are underway to better determine the exact compartmental location of Abcg5 / sterolin - 1 in the Abcg8 - / - mice.	"mice	150	154	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Given the data presented here and from the Abcg5 - deficient mouse this does not appear to be the case.	"mouse	61	66	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Taken together, these animal models suggest that Abcg5 / sterolin - 1 and Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 have independent function in vivo or that there are proteins other than the sterolins that can secrete biliary sterols.

To determine whether mitochondrial function was altered in the skeletal muscle of PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice, mitochondrial respiration rates were measured using tissue strips prepared from soleus muscle.

In soleus of PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice, a significant defect in state 3 ( ADP - stimulated) respiration, but not state 2 ( basal), was detected using succinate as the substrate ( Figure 3D).	"mice	33	37	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
State 4 respiration rates ( in the presence of oligomycin) were also similar between the genotypes, indicating that the coupling of respiration to ATP production was not significantly altered in PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice.

PGC - 1 alpha - / - male mice exhibited a significantly lower mean number of ambulations and rearings during the hour compared to the PGC - 1 alpha + / + age - matched controls ( Figure 4).

"However, an analysis of exploratory behavior showed that the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice were reluctant to go into the center of the "" field "" compared to controls."	"mice	81	85	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
"Specifically, PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice made significantly fewer entries into, spent significantly less time in, and traveled a significantly shorter distance in the central area of the "" field, "" although differences in distance traveled in the peripheral zone of the "" field "" was not significantly different between groups ( Figure S2)."

These data suggest that the general activity level may have been affected by the reluctance of the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice to go into the central area of the field and thus remain in the periphery ( thigmotaxis), possibly reflecting altered emotionality such as increased fear.	"mice	119	123	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
A battery of tests was performed to further evaluate the general sensorimotor phenotype of the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice.	"mice	115	119	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice were unable to remain on an inverted screen for as long as the PGC - 1 alpha + / + controls ( Figure 4A).	"mice	33	37	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
To further evaluate the skeletal muscle phenotype, exercise capacity was assessed in the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice.	"mice	109	113	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
To this end, the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice were exercised on a motorized treadmill apparatus using a run - to - exhaustion format.	"mice	37	41	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The same result was obtained with younger PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice, i. e., at 3. 5 mo of age ( unpublished data).	"mice	62	66	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
VO2max was significantly lower for the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice ( 120. 9 +/- 2. 0 ml O2. kg - 1. min - 1) compared to PGC - 1 alpha + / + controls ( 141. 6 +/- 2. 1 ml O2. kg - 1. min - 1) ( Figure 4B).

During the initial phase of the stimulation period, there was no difference in force generation in muscles isolated from PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice and PGC - 1 alpha + / + controls.	"mice	141	145	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, fatigue resistance index, defined as the percent of initial force generated following a 2 - min series of fatiguing contractions, was significantly lower in the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice ( 14. 6 +/- 1. 5%) compared to PGC - 1 alpha + / + controls ( 24. 8 +/- 2. 9%) ( Figure 4C).

Echocardiographic screening studies of PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice at ages 4 - 6 mo did not reveal any significant differences in chamber sizes or ventricular function compared to WT controls ( unpublished data).

Given that the exercise capacity of PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice is diminished, a series of preliminary treadmill exercise studies were performed to define a reasonable exercise duration for run - to - exhaustion to be used as a target duration for the EST.	"mice	56	60	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Echocardiographic images were obtained immediately following 60 s of exercise for the PGC - 1 alpha + / + controls or at the point of exhaustion for PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice ( mean 60 +/- 6. 1 s, range 45 - 90 s).

The mean heart rate of the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice exhibited an inappropriate decline during the post exercise period ( Figure 5A).	"mice	47	51	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
To directly assess cardiac function, the hearts of PGC - 1 alpha - / - and PGC - 1 alpha + / + mice were isolated and perfused in the working mode.	"mice	95	99	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The relative contribution of heart rate and stroke volume to diminished cardiac output in the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice could not be delineated, because both were decreased but neither to a significant degree ( Table 1).

PGC - 1 alpha - / - Mice Exhibit an Abnormal Thermogenic Response	"Mice	20	24	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Mice"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
To determine whether PGC - 1 alpha is necessary for an appropriate thermogenic response, PGC - 1 alpha + / + and PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice were subjected to cold exposure ( 4 degrees C) for a 5 - h period while core body temperature was monitored.	"mice	133	137	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice exhibited a markedly abnormal drop in core temperature compared to the WT controls ( Figure 6A).	"mice	20	24	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Specifically, the mean decline in core temperature was greater than 12 degrees C at the 5 - h time point in PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice, compared to an approximately 3 degrees C decrement in PGC - 1 alpha + / + controls.	"mice	128	132	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The histologic appearance and neutral lipid stores of BAT were assessed as an initial step to characterize the thermogenic phenotype exhibited by PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice.	"mice	166	170	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 166, ""end_span"": 170, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Electron microscopic analyses indicated that the mitochondrial ultrastructure was similar in BAT isolated from PGC - 1 alpha - / - and PGC - 1 alpha + / + mice before and after cold exposure ( unpublished data).	"mice	155	159	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 159, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Surprisingly, basal and cold - induced BAT UCP - 1 mRNA levels were similar in PGC - 1 alpha + / + and PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice ( Figure 6B).	"mice	123	127	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These results suggest that PGC - 1 alpha is not necessary for the induction of the expression of UCP - 1 with cold exposure, and that other factors, such as reduced capacity for mitochondrial respiration, likely contribute to the abnormal thermogenic response in the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice.

Accordingly, the in vivo oxygen consumption response to beta 3 - adrenergic stimulation was examined in PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice.	"mice	124	128	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
VO2 was significantly increased in response to BRL 3744 in PGC - 1 alpha + / + but not PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice ( Figure 6C).	"mice	107	111	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These results indicate that the metabolic response of BAT to an acute stimulus such as cold and / or beta 3 - adrenergic stimulation is altered in the PGC - 1 alpha null mice, likely related to reduced capacity for mitochondrial respiratory uncoupling.

Fasting - Induced Hepatic Steatosis in PGC - 1 alpha - / - Mice	"Mice	59	63	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Mice"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Under basal fed conditions, the livers of the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice appeared grossly normal and did not exhibit histologic abnormalities ( unpublished data).	"mice	66	70	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, following a 24 h - fast, the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice exhibited marked hepatic steatosis as determined by gross inspection, oil red O staining, electron microscopy, and measurements of liver triglyceride ( TAG) levels ( Figure 7).	"mice	58	62	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
To further investigate the mechanisms involved in the fasting - induced hepatic steatotic response, hepatocytes were isolated from PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice and WT controls.	"mice	151	155	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 151, ""end_span"": 155, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Therefore, we sought to determine whether the steatotic phenotype of the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice related to reduced expression of PPAR target genes.	"mice	93	97	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Next, we performed experiments to determine whether the reduced capacity for fat oxidation in the hepatocytes of the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice was related to altered mitochondrial respiratory function.	"mice	137	141	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Although the liver gene expression profiling studies did not reveal abnormalities in the fatty acid oxidation pathway in the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice, several interesting differences in the activity of the sterol regulatory element binding protein - 1c ( SREBP - 1c) pathway were noted.	"mice	145	149	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Specifically, the fasting - mediated down - regulation of SREBP - 1c and its target gene stearoyl - CoA desaturase ( SCD1), was abolished in PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice ( Table 2).	"mice	161	165	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 161, ""end_span"": 165, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Furthermore, expression of the gene encoding diglyceride acyltransferase ( DGAT), which catalyzes the last step in TAG synthesis, was activated at baseline and induced by fasting to a greater level in PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice ( Table 2).	"mice	221	225	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 221, ""end_span"": 225, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These results suggest that, in addition to a defect in oxidation, components of the TAG synthesis pathway are activated in the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice.	"mice	147	151	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
3H - TAG incorporation was increased nearly 50% in hepatocytes isolated from PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice compared to PGC - 1 alpha + / + controls ( Figure 8D), confirming that TAG synthesis rates are increased in PGC - 1 alpha null hepatocytes, identifying a second potential mechanism contributing to the fasting - induced hepatic steatosis.

Accordingly, peripheral glucose disposal and insulin responsiveness were examined in PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice.	"mice	105	109	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Glucose tolerance testing of 2 - mo - old male and female mice revealed no significant difference in blood glucose excursion between PGC - 1 alpha + / + and PGC - 1 alpha - / - groups ( unpublished data).

Given that older female PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice develop an increase in body fat stores, glucose tolerance and insulin responsiveness were further evaluated in this group.	"mice	44	48	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
To examine glucose homeostasis in response to high - fat diet, female PGC - 1 alpha + / + and PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice were placed on high - fat chow ( 43% calories from fat) for 6 wk starting at 8 wk of age.

Taken together, these results indicate that, despite excess body fat under standard conditions, the female PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice do not exhibit insulin resistance.	"mice	127	131	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

However, several lines of evidence support the conclusion that PGC - 1 alpha is necessary for the programs that regulate postnatal mitochondrial function and cellular energy metabolism, processes that equip the organism for the energy metabolic rigors of the postnatal environment.

Finally, PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice do not respond normally to a variety of physiologic and dietary stresses known to increase oxidative energy demands.	"mice	29	33	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Extensive phenotypic analyses demonstrated that mice lacking PGC - 1 alpha are unable to cope with physiologic stressors relevant to postnatal survival.	"mice	48	52	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
For example, a skeletal muscle phenotype was unveiled in PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice under conditions in which energy supply becomes limiting.	"mice	77	81	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This was most clearly demonstrated by the profound abnormalities exhibited by PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice with exercise - to - exhaustion and repetitive muscle stimulation studies.	"mice	98	102	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

Indeed, we found that exposure of the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice to cold, another relevant physiologic stress, resulted in an untoward drop in core body temperature consistent with an abnormality in thermogenesis despite normal cold induction of UCP - 1 mRNA in BAT.	"mice	58	62	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Studies with a beta 3 - adrenergic agonist confirmed that the peak oxygen consumption rate in thermogenic tissue is diminished in PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice.	"mice	150	154	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

The observation of fasting - induced hepatic steatosis is another example of the inability of PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice to respond to postnatal environmental metabolic demands.	"mice	114	118	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Following short - term starvation, we found that the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice developed marked hepatocyte triglyceride accumulation.	"mice	73	77	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Further analysis revealed that palmitate oxidation rates were reduced in hepatocytes isolated from the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice, which would predispose to lipid accumulation.	"mice	123	127	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In addition, we found that triglyceride synthesis was abnormally activated, and the expression of genes encoding SREBP - 1c and SCD - 1, key proteins in the hepatic lipogenic pathway, failed to be appropriately down - regulated in fasted PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice.	"mice	258	262	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 258, ""end_span"": 262, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We found that after 18 wk of age, female PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice exhibit a mild but significantly abnormal weight increase associated with increased fat stores.	"mice	61	65	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
With further aging, a modest but significant increase in body fat was also noted in male PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice ( unpublished data).	"mice	109	113	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We did not find differences in food intake or activity levels in female PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice.	"mice	92	96	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
It is possible that a reduction in systemic energy utilization, related to the mitochondrial dysfunction, leads to increased fat mass and weight gain in the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice.	"mice	177	181	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 181, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Interestingly, an association between PGC - 1 alpha gene polymorphisms and obesity in humans has been recently reported [ 26].	"humans	86	92	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""humans"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Clearly, future studies of male and female PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice in pure - strain backgrounds over a range of ages will be necessary to fully investigate the observed abnormalities in weight control and fat distribution.	"mice	63	67	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We did not find evidence for glucose intolerance or insulin resistance in the PGC - 1 alpha - / - animals on standard chow.	"animals	98	105	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Moreover, female PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice were more glucose - tolerant and insulin - sensitive than PGC - 1 alpha + / + controls when consuming a high - fat diet.	"mice	37	41	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These findings are surprising, given the results of several recent studies demonstrating reduced expression of PGC - 1 alpha in human diabetic skeletal muscle [ 24, 34].	"human	128	133	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
It is certainly possible that compensatory metabolic regulatory mechanisms have been activated in the PGC - 1 alpha - deficient mice, accounting for this observation.	"mice	128	132	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Consistent with this notion, we and others have shown that mice lacking the PGC - 1 alpha target PPAR exhibit resistance to diet - induced glucose intolerance [ 21, 35, 36].	"mice	59	63	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Histologic surveys of the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice revealed ultrastructural abnormalities in the central nervous system.	"mice	46	50	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Inspection of sections prepared from the brains of PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice revealed patchy areas of microvacuolation in the pyramidal neurons of the cerebral cortex, accompanied by a mild increase in the number of astrocytes in the basal ganglia.

These deficits are likely due to impaired muscle strength in the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice, but contributions by peripheral or central nervous system determinants ( or both) could be contributory.	"mice	85	89	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Moreover, evidence of altered emotionality from the 1 - h locomotor activity test also suggests the possibility of altered brain function in PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice.	"mice	161	165	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 161, ""end_span"": 165, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
It will be of interest to determine whether the neurologic abnormalities contribute to the systemic metabolic abnormalities of the PGC - 1 alpha null mice.	"mice	150	154	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
During the preparation of this manuscript, Lin et al. reported an independent mouse line in which the PGC - 1 alpha gene was targeted [ 37].	"mouse	78	83	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
First, in contrast to Lin et al., the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice described here do not exhibit any postnatal mortality.	"mice	58	62	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In addition, whereas Lin et al. found an abnormal expression profile forCCAAT - enhancer - binding protein beta and delta and the gluconeogenic genes encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose - 6 - phosphatase at baseline and with fasting in the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice, we did not ( unpublished data).	"mice	279	283	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 279, ""end_span"": 283, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Third, we found evidence for an age - related increase in body fat in PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice ( females earlier than males), whereas Lin et al. identified a male - specific resistance to diet - induced obesity and insulin resistance.	"mice	90	94	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We have also found that male PGC - 1 alpha - deficient mice are somewhat protected against diet - induced obesity ( Figure S4).	"mice	55	59	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, we observed that the insulin - sensitive phenotype of the female PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice occurred in the context of normal weight gain with high - fat diet.	"mice	94	98	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These latter results indicate that the insulin - sensitive phenotype of PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice cannot be fully explained by a lean phenotype.	"mice	92	96	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Fifth, Lin et al. found a neurologic phenotype in males characterized by hyperactivity, whereas the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice described here show reduced locomotor activity.	"mice	120	124	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, it should be noted that we did not study activity levels over an extended period of time in males as did Lin et al., so it is possible that our findings reflect an emotional disturbance that manifests only when the animals are placed in a new environment.

The reasons for the interesting differences between the two PGC - 1 alpha - deficient mouse lines are not clear.	"mouse	86	91	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In addition, the incompletely penetrant postnatal mortality noted in the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice reported by Lin et al. could have resulted in a selection bias toward greater levels of compensatory responses in liver and other tissues in the surviving group.	"mice	93	97	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Lin et al. generated PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice by Cre recombinase - mediated excision of exons 3 - 5 in oocytes.	"mice	41	45	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice described here were generated by a targeting event that involved a 3 ' homologous recombination leading to an insertion of the targeting vector including an extra exon 3 between exons 5 and 6.	"mice	24	28	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
If small amounts of PGC - 1 alpha activity are present in the mice reported here, it could explain some of the observed differences between the models.	"mice	62	66	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, the bulk of data presented here support the conclusion that the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice described are completely deficient in PGC - 1 alpha.	"mice	93	97	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

Indeed, although PGC - 1 alpha null mice survive in the protected environment of the laboratory, our results indicate that in the rigors of a typical external environment, PGC - 1 alpha would be necessary for survival.

We provide genetic evidence in the mouse that precocious ETS expression in DRG sensory neurons perturbs axonal projections, the acquisition of terminal differentiation markers, and their dependence on neurotrophic support.

In particular, genetic experiments have addressed the survival - independent role of neurotrophic factors during development by exploiting strains of mice defective both in neurotrophin signaling and in the function of the proapoptotic gene Bax [ 8, 9].

In vertebrates, peripheral neurotrophic signals have been shown to direct the onset of expression of the ETS transcription factors Er81 and Pea3 in DRG sensory neurons and motor neuron pools several days after these neurons have become post - mitotic [ 9, 13, 14, 15, 16].	"vertebrates	3	14	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""vertebrates"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In this study, we have used mouse genetics to test this general idea, by investigating whether the precise timing of onset of ETS transcription factor signaling is essential for normal sensory neuron development.

These findings prompted us to analyze mice in which we integrated EWS - Pea3, a break - point fusion product between the amino - terminal domain of the Ewing sarcoma ( EWS) gene and the Pea3 DNA binding domain [ 20, 21], into the Er81 locus ( Figure 1).	"mice	38	42	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Er81EWS - Pea3 / - mice did not differ from wild - type in the number of proprioceptive afferent cell bodies within the DRG of L1 to L5, the expression of several genes normally expressed by proprioceptive afferents, and the lack of expression of genes not normally expressed in proprioceptive afferents ( Figure S1; data not shown).

To determine the extent of rescue of Ia proprioceptive afferent projections into the ventral spinal cord of Er81 mutant mice achieved by expression of EWS - Pea3, we traced intraspinal afferent projections by axonal labeling of PV ( Figure 2A - 2C).

Targeting cassettes were integrated into the Tau locus to generate two strains of mice conditionally expressing either EWS - Pea3 or a membrane - targeted green fluorescent protein ( mGFP) to trace axonal projections of DRG neurons ( Figure S3; [ 25]).

Several quantitative trait loci ( QTL) have been identified that influence two - bottle intake of bitter stimuli in the mouse, including loci for quinine ( Qui) [ 12, 16, 26], cyclohexamide ( Cyx) [ 13] and sucrose octaacetate ( Soa) [ 14, 15, 17] sensitivity.	"mouse	120	125	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Each of these QTL map to mouse distal chromosome 6 and are linked to the marker D6Mit13, which lies within a cluster of 24 intact Tas2rs in the C57BL / 6 genome ( e. g., [ 16, 27, 28]).	"mouse	25	30	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Here we use a taste - salient brief - access lick test [ 29, 37] to measure taste sensitivities in C57BL / 6J ( B6), DBA / 2J ( D2) and BXD / Ty ( BXD) recombinant inbred ( RI) mice to two bitter stimuli, quinine hydrochloride ( QHCl) and denatonium benzoate ( DB).	"mice	177	181	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 181, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We used a modified brief - access lick test, which minimizes the contribution of such effects [ 29, 37] to determine whether B6 and D2 mice display differences in taste sensitivity to the taste stimuli QHCl and DB.	"mice	135	139	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
After initially screening B6 and D2 mice to determine stimulus concentrations that were aversive but not saturating [ 47], we selected two ligand concentrations for each compound that best differentiated the two strains.	"mice	36	40	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Avoidance by male and female B6 and D2 mice increased ( as indicated by the decreased lick ratio) in a concentration - dependent manner for both compounds ( Figure 1A; Table 1).	"mice	39	43	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

BXD mice also typically avoided both stimuli in a concentration dependent manner ( Figures 1B - 1D; Table 1).	"mice	4	8	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
A major QTL for QHCl taste on mouse chromosome 6.	"mouse	30	35	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
BXD / Ty - 34 RI mice display a clear D2 phenotype for QHCl taste ( Figure 1C) and D2 genotype for D6Mit13, but have a B6 genotype for D6Mit61 [ 39, 40], indicating that D6Mit61 is unlinked to the QHCl QTL.	"mice	17	21	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Therefore, this QTL interval can be conservatively defined as that portion of mouse chromosome 6 that lies between D6Mit254 and D6Mit374, but is most likely restricted to the region between D6Mit61 and D6Mit374.

If one ( or more) Tas2rs underlie the chromosome 6 QHCl taste sensitivity QTL, we would predict that one ( or more) Tas2r genes would exhibit one of three likely characteristics: ( 1) A Tas2r allele is a pseudogene, or is deleted, in D2 ( QHCL - insensitive), but not B6 ( QHCl - sensitive), mice; ( 2) Missense mutations in the single coding exon of a D2 Tas2r allele impact protein functions such as ligand binding or receptor coupling to downstream signaling cascades; ( 3) Mutations in noncoding or regulatory regions of a D2 Tas2r allele affects expression of the protein product.	"mice	292	296	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 292, ""end_span"": 296, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Twenty - four intact Tas2rs, along with three apparent Tas2r pseudogenes, have been identified in the distal chromosome 6 cluster of B6 mice [ 19] ( Figure 4).	"mice	136	140	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
A third, Tas2r120, could not be amplified from D2 genomic DNA ( Figure 5) using either of two pairs of oligonucleotides ( Additional file 2), suggesting that this Tas2r is deleted in D2 mice.	"mice	186	190	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 186, ""end_span"": 190, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
All 24 Tas2rs examined have different alleles in B6 and D2 mice, and 307 single nucleotide polymorphisms are present within coding exons ( data not shown).	"mice	59	63	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
For Tas2r120, which is likely deleted in D2 mice, the absence of a PCR product was diagnostic of the D2 genotype for this gene.	"mice	44	48	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The Tas2r cluster is a single haplotype in BXD / Ty RI mice.	"mice	55	59	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The gustatory system of mammals is thought to detect thousands of chemically - diverse bitter - tasting substances [ 41].	"mammals	24	31	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mammals"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We have found that a single QTL on distal chromosome 6 accounts for most of the variation in QHCL taste sensitivity between B6 and D2 mice.	"mice	134	138	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Positional cloning also permitted the identification of the Tas2r responsible for the majority of variance of phenylthiocarbamide ( PTC) taste sensitivity in humans [ 18].	"humans	158	164	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""humans"", ""start_span"": 158, ""end_span"": 164, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
It is somewhat puzzling that 22 of the 24 Tas2rs examined encode variant proteins in B6 and D2 mice even though these strains exhibit similar taste responses to bitter compounds such as DB or cyclohexamide [ 47].	"mice	95	99	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, the fact that these two mouse strains, members of the same species, are so closely related makes this explanation problematic.	"mouse	33	38	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Characterization of Tas2r sequences of several wild mouse species or subspecies, or in other inbred lines, would shed light on this issue.	"mouse	52	57	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In conclusion, we have found that sensitivity to the bitter - tasting substance quinine, as assayed by a taste specific brief - access test, is a polygenic trait in mice.	"mice	165	169	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 169, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Most Tas2r genes in the distal chromosome 6 cluster are polymorphic across inbred strains of mice, and this cluster forms a single haplotype that correlates with quinine taste sensitivity.	"mice	93	97	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

Trials were 5 s in length with an inter - trial interval of 10 s, and mice had up to 120 s to initiate a trial; if a trial was not initiated during this interval, the shutter closed for 10 s and the next trial was presented.

The reduction in both osteoblast and osteoclast activity in the 12 - month - old Sam68 + / + mice argued against bone being lost primarily due to a relative increase in osteoclast over osteoblast activity, as seen in high turnover disease [ 49].

Short - term cultures of mature osteoclasts released from the crushed long bones of Sam68 + / + and Sam68 - / - mice stained equally well for TRAP and excavated approximately equal numbers of pits of equal size in dentin slices, as visualized by scanning electron microscopy ( Figure 6B).	"mice	112	116	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These data, together with data confirming a lean phenotype in Sam68 - / - mice ( N. Torabi and S.

Given the apparent enhancement of mineralized nodule formation by Sam68 - / - bone marrow stromal cells ex vivo and the phenotype observed with short hairpin RNA ( shRNA) - treated C3H10T1 / 2, we stained sections of bone from 4 - and 12 - month - old mice for evidence of changes in marrow adiposity.

Figure 9 shows sections of undecalcified bone from 4 - and 12 - month - old Sam68 + / + and Sam68 - / - mice stained with von Kossa and toluidine blue to show mineralized tissue ( Figure 9A, black) and marrow adipocytes ( Figure 9B, white) and left unstained to show fluorochrome labeling of the mineralization fronts ( Figure 9C).

Twelve - month - old Sam68 + / + mice showed a noticeable decrease in trabecular bone ( Figure 9A), which was associated with a significant increase in marrow adiposity ( Figure 9B) and with the two fluorochrome labels superimposed upon one another ( Figure 9C).

The differentiation of bone marrow stem cells isolated from Sam68 - / - mice and embryonic mesenchymal multipotential progenitor cells C3H10T1 / 2 treated with Sam68 shRNA resulted in a more pronounced osteoblast differentiation.	"mice	72	76	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The converse was also true, as MEFs isolated from Sam68 - / - animals were impaired in their ability to undergo adipocyte differentiation compared with Sam68 + / + MEFs.	"animals	62	69	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Sam68 protein expression was observed throughout the developing mouse embryo, in keeping with previous reports that identified the Sam68 mRNA to be widely expressed [ 38].	"mouse	64	69	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

The Sam68 - / - males were sterile and the Sam68 - / - females provided inadequate care to their young, but the pups were not scattered and neglected as observed with FosB - / - mice [ 53].	"mice	178	182	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 178, ""end_span"": 182, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The Src tyrosine kinase was shown to play a role in bone remodeling when Src - / - mice died at 6 months of age with an osteopetrotic phenotype [ 48] and the defect was attributed to defective osteoclast function [ 55 - 59].	"mice	83	87	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We therefore cultured mature osteoclasts harvested from Sam68 + / + and Sam68 - / - mice ex vivo on dentin slices to quantify their resorptive capacity.	"mice	84	88	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The fact that Sam68 - / - osteoclasts looked and acted like Sam68 + / + osteoclasts ex vivo and in vivo made it unlikely that this was the primary source of the difference in bone metabolism in 12 - month - old Sam68 - / - mice.	"mice	223	227	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 223, ""end_span"": 227, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The fact that the CTX levels were lower in young and old Sam68 - / - mice suggested that there is reduced bone resorption compared with wild - type littermate controls.	"mice	69	73	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These observations are consistent with the Sam68 - / - mice having a youth - like bone phenotype.	"mice	55	59	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, it is still possible, that a mild impairment in Sam68 - / - mice osteoclast function may manifest itself later in life in overall accumulation of bone and this will require further detailed studies.	"mice	69	73	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
It will be important to demonstrate that a similar effect is observed using primary bone marrow stromal cells from aged Sam68 - / - mice.	"mice	132	136	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The bone phenotype observed in Sam68 - / - mice imply that inhibitors of Sam68 could prevent age - related bone loss.	"mice	43	47	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Furthermore, the results also suggest that Sam68 expression levels, hypomorphism, and mutations in humans may influence susceptibility to marrow adipocyte accumulation and osteoporosis.

This establishes that mu - calpain and m - calpain have distinct functions, and that m - calpain is vital for development of the preimplantation murine embryo.	"murine	145	151	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""murine"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The two ubiquitous Ca2 + - dependent, cysteine proteases known as mu - calpain ( calpain - 1) and m - calpain ( capain - 2), are the founding members of a gene family comprising 13 genes in mammals [ 1 - 3].	"mammals	190	197	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mammals"", ""start_span"": 190, ""end_span"": 197, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Despite these similarities, the differential expression patterns of mu - and m - calpain in mammalian tissues suggest they have some isoform specific and distinct functions.	"mammalian	92	101	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mammalian"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Targeted gene deletion in mice provides a powerful approach to determining the physiological roles of mu - and m - calpain and the opportunity to approach their isoform specific functions.	"mice	26	30	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Capn4 - / - murine embryos died between days 10 and 11 of gestation, and there was no detectable mu - or m - calpain activity in these or younger embryos [ 31].	"murine	12	18	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""murine"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Capn4 - / - murine embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs) could be cultured from these embryos, although they also lacked calpain activity as assessed by casein zymography or by the formation of characteristic spectrin breakdown products, and they displayed migration defects consistent with a role for calpain in release of focal adhesions [ 9].	"murine	12	18	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""murine"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Disruption of Capn1, encoding the mu - calpain catalytic subunit, was subsequently reported to result in fertile, viable mice with some mild defects in the mu - calpain rich platelets relating to their aggregation and clot retraction [ 33].	"mice	121	125	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The fact that Capn4 null mice die during embryogenesis indicates that at least one of the ubiquitous calpains is essential for development to term.	"mice	25	29	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The viability of Capn1 - deficient mice does not however distinguish between two possibilities: either that m - calpain is specifically required during embryogenesis, or that either form of calpain alone is sufficient and can compensate for the absence of the other.

Curiously, the ratio of Capn2 + / + to Capn2 + / - animals from inbred heterozygous intercrosses was substantially less than the predicted 1: 2 Mendelian ratio.	"animals	51	58	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The ratio of Capn2 + / + to Capn2 + / - animals among males ( 14% to 82%) or females ( 13% to 90%) was essentially the same is it was for the combined population, and there were an average of six pups per litter, which is normal for this background strain.

In these crosses the ratios of Capn2 + / + to Capn2 + / - animals among males or females compared well with the ratio in the combined populations; 77% of males and 69% of females were Capn2 + / - when the mutant allele came from the mother, and 62% of males and 55% of females were Capn2 + / - when the mutant allele came from the father.

Two independent laboratories observed embryonic lethality in Capn4 knockout mice, albeit at different stages of development [ 31, 32].	"mice	76	80	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These options were narrowed down by the subsequent observation that Capn1 - / - mice, which lack the mu - calpain catalytic subunit, were healthy and fertile, although platelet aggregation and clot retraction defects were observed [ 33].	"mice	80	84	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

The different timing of lethality in the Capn4 knockouts might also be a consequence of the different genetic backgrounds of the two transgenic lines, which has been observed to influence the phenotype of transgenic mice on a number of occasions [ 37].

It is now clear, from the gene targeting work done in mice, that mu - and m - calpain have some distinct physiological roles, at least during embryogenesis.	"mice	54	58	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

As a result, it is not possible to determine whether the absence of marked phenotype in Capn1 - / - animals is due to a compensatory affect by the remaining m - calpain activity, or whether the functions of mu - calpain are simply not essential.

Nonetheless, the ability of ( + / +), ( + / -) and ( - / -) mice to find the hidden platform improved over test sessions ( Fig. 2A).	"mice	60	64	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

It is widely accepted that the cerebellum is involved in the performance of the rotating rod task, since mice with structural abnormalities in the cerebellum [ 31] or with disruptions in genes enriched in the cerebellum [ 32] exhibit performance deficits in this task.

On the other hand, in the visual platform version of the water maze task, motor ability for swimming in ADAM11 - deficient mice was normal.	"mice	123	127	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

However, the deficit of motor learning in ADAM11 - deficient mice was not clear in this study.	"mice	61	65	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
To examine motor learning ability in ADAM11 - deficient mice in detail, we will need to use other cerebellar - dependent learning tasks, such as a classical eyelid conditioning test.	"mice	56	60	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
There was no impairment in the grip strength and wire suspension test in ADAM11 - deficient mice.	"mice	92	96	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Spontaneous motor activity and walking patterns of ADAM11 - deficient mice were also found to be normal, suggesting that the dysfunction found in the rotating rod test was not derived from muscle weakness or other peripheral disturbances.	"mice	70	74	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These results suggest that limited brain sites, mainly the hippocampus and cerebellum, might contribute to the dominant phenotype, spatial learning impairment and motor discoordination in ADAM11 - deficient mice.

It is unlikely that morphological changes during development led to impairment of spatial learning and motor coordination, and morphological alterations in the cytoarchitecture of the hippocampus and cerebellum were not observed in ADAM11 - deficient mice after histological investigation using HE staining.

Therefore, electrophyological studies to enable analysis of synaptic transmission and plasticity in the hippocampus and cerebellum of ADAM11 - deficient mice will be needed.	"mice	153	157	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

The use of mouse models has provided valuable insight into the etiology of monogenic syndromes caused by single gene mutations.	"mouse	11	16	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, such models do not mimic the genetic complexity of disease traits commonly seen in the human population.	"human	96	101	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
To date numerous mouse growth and obesity QTL have been localized [ 1, 2], however, little progress has been made in determining the specific nature of the underlying genetic variants.	"mouse	17	22	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This is accomplished by eliminating segregating genetic variation outside the locus of interest and reducing the environmental variation influencing a trait by characterizing large numbers of genetically identical mice.	"mice	214	218	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 214, ""end_span"": 218, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This strategy uses marker - assisted selection to identify male mice inheriting fewer donor alleles, than expected on average, during each backcross.	"mice	64	68	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Numerous traditionally developed and speed congenics have been used to successfully isolate mouse QTL for a wide array of traits, including growth and obesity [ 7 - 13].	"mouse	92	97	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The C57Bl / 6J - hg / hg ( HG) mouse is a model of systemic overgrowth resulting from a spontaneous deletion on MMU10, which eliminates expression of the Socs2 ( suppressor of cytokine signaling 2) gene [ 14 - 16].	"mouse	31	36	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The role of Socs2 in the HG phenotype was confirmed by an independently engineered Socs2 - / - knockout mouse which shared a number of phenotypes in common with HG, including gigantism [ 17].	"mouse	104	109	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Both sexes had reductions in weight at 2 ( 2WK), 3 ( 3WK), 6 ( 6WK) and 9 ( 9WK) weeks of age compared to control B6C mice ( Figure 3).	"mice	118	122	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Additionally, B62D mice displayed significantly shorter tail lengths despite no difference in naso - anal length ( NA) ( Table 2).	"mice	19	23	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In contrast, B62M mice displayed small decreases in body weights and growth ( male 9WK was significant, female 6WK and 9WK were suggestive at P < 0. 05) and significant decreases in NA ( male P = 0. 0152) and tail length ( Additional File 3 and Table 2).	"mice	18	22	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Interestingly, no difference in adiposity was seen in B62M mice.	"mice	59	63	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
HG2P and HG2PM mice of both sexes displayed significant decreases in post - weaning body weights and growth rates ( Additional Table 3).	"mice	15	19	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In addition, the HG2M strain displayed highly significant decreases in length, similar to B62M mice ( Table 2).	"mice	95	99	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Similar to growth traits a general decrease in GFP, MFP, RFP, TF and AI were seen in HG2P and HG2PM mice ( Region II) ( Table 2).	"mice	100	104	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Surprisingly, HG2M mice displayed striking sex differences in adiposity.	"mice	19	23	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In the present study, only homozygous congenic mice were characterized, thus, the overdominant effects of Wg2 were not tested.	"mice	47	51	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Unfortunately, we were unable to characterize HG2D mice.	"mice	51	55	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, as noted above, strong sex - specific effects were seen in HG2M mice.	"mice	73	77	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In accordance, HG1 mice had small differences in all growth and length traits.	"mice	19	23	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Interestingly, in HG8 mice no differences in growth were detected; however, they were significantly leaner than controls ( Table 5).	"mice	22	26	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
HG8 mice represent a lean congenic model in which CAST alleles protect against fat accumulation.	"mice	4	8	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This was expected since NA was previously found to be an excellent indicator of femur length ( R2 = 0. 88) in HG mice [ 27] and as noted above this region contains the Feml2 QTL [ 24].	"mice	113	117	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In contrast to those results, HG11 mice displayed significant differences in growth and obesity between the sexes.	"mice	35	39	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In the original intercross CAST alleles at MMU17 markers were associated with decreases in femur length, ASH and PROT [ 24] and similar results were seen in HG17 mice.	"mice	162	166	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 162, ""end_span"": 166, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In general growth differences ranged between 5% and 15% lower in congenic mice.	"mice	74	78	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

In general, HG17 mice displayed increases in all fat pads ( except MFP), TF and AI ( Table 5).	"mice	17	21	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

Maternal genotype effects on growth and obesity have been observed in a number of mouse crosses [ 8, 32 - 35] and their existence in the current cross cannot be discounted.	"mouse	82	87	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In classical terms, they are QTL which modify the expressivity of growth and obesity in HG mice [ 18].	"mice	91	95	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Cloning these QTL has major implications to improve our understanding of Gh and its regulation of growth and adiposity and in the administration of human Gh therapeutics.	"human	148	153	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

Originally, Q1Ucd1 had small effects and these results illustrate the power of congenic strain analysis to isolate small effect QTL, although it is likely this QTL represents the lower boundary of detection using only 20 - 30 congenic mice.

Thirdly, MMU11 growth QTL overlapping HG11 have been identified in a number of crosses using different mouse strains [ 37 - 41].	"mouse	103	108	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Additionally, functional variation in Stat5b may explain the sex - specific phenotypes in HG11 mice since it is the primary transcription factor responsible for Gh induced sex - specific liver gene expression [ 44].

The genes encoding members of the wingless - related MMTV integration site ( WNT) and fibroblast growth factor ( FGF) families coordinate growth, morphogenesis, and differentiation in many fields of cells during development.	"MMTV	53	57	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""MMTV"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In the mouse, Fgf9 and Wnt4 are expressed in gonads of both sexes prior to sex determination.	"mouse	7	12	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 7, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In the mouse XY gonad, Sry normally initiates a feed - forward loop between Sox9 and Fgf9, which up - regulates Fgf9 and represses Wnt4 to establish the testis pathway.	"mouse	7	12	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 7, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The role of the male sex - determining switch -- Sry in the case of mammals -- is to tip the balance between these underlying patterning signals.	"mammals	68	75	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mammals"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In principle, sex determination in other vertebrates may operate through any switch that introduces an imbalance between these two signaling pathways.	"vertebrates	41	52	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""vertebrates"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The development of sexually dimorphic reproductive organs is a common feature among animal species.	"animal	84	90	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animal"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Consistent with the idea that cells in this primordium are poised between two developmental pathways, some of the genes that are involved in establishing sexual dimorphism, including Dax1 ( dosage - sensitive sex reversal - congenital adrenal hypoplasia critical region on the X chromosome protein 1), Sox9 ( Sry - like HMG box 9), Fgf9 ( fibroblast growth factor 9), and Wnt4 ( wingless - related MMTV integration site 4), are initially expressed in similar patterns in XX and XY gonads [ 3 - 8].

The conventional view of mammalian sex determination is that the basic pathway of organ development is ovarian, and that the testis - determining gene operates by diverting this program toward testis development by simultaneously influencing the fate of the key supporting cell lineage and initiating a male - specific morphogenetic program.	"mammalian	25	34	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mammalian"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Sry, a Y chromosome - linked gene, is the primary sex - determining gene in mammals [ 12 - 14].	"mammals	76	83	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mammals"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Genetic evidence from chimeric mice [ 15], and expression studies using reporter transgenes [ 2, 16], indicate that Sry expression is required only in precursors of the somatic supporting cell lineage.	"mice	31	35	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Unlike Sry, which is specific to mammals, expression of Sox9 is known to be conserved in the gonad of many species.	"mammals	33	40	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mammals"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In mammals, Sox9 is up - regulated immediately after Sry expression initiates.	"mammals	3	10	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mammals"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Mice homozygous for a null mutation in Fgf9 display male - to - female sex reversal caused by disruption of all testis - specific cellular events, including cell proliferation, mesonephric cell migration, testis cord formation, and the differentiation of Sertoli cells [ 26, 27].

To investigate this possibility, we mated Fgf9 + / - mice with a transgenic reporter line that carries an enhanced green fluorescent protein ( EGFP) transgene driven by the Sry promoter Sry - EGFP.

The Drosophila genital disk is also a field of cells that normally follows one of two sexually dimorphic fates.	"Drosophila	4	14	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Sex - specific regulation of gonad organogenesis in vertebrates may occur in a similar manner, where some cells are cell - autonomously responsive to the sex - determining switch; however, the establishment of the male or female program occurs through the non - cell - autonomous activity of classic signaling pathways that act in an antagonistic manner and coordinate growth, cell differentiation and morphogenesis in the gonad.	"vertebrates	52	63	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""vertebrates"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The interplay between cell - autonomous and non - cell - autonomous pathways in the mammalian gonad is not well understood.	"mammalian	84	93	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mammalian"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
It appears that the male pathway can be initiated by disrupting the balance between Wnt4 and Fgf9, a finding that has strong implications for other vertebrate sex - determination systems in which Sry is not the sex determining factor.

The differences in the photopic ( light - adapted) responses, initiated by cone photoreceptors, which make up 3% of the photosensory neurons in the mouse retina [ 38], were less obvious but still exhibited a trend toward reduced amplitudes across a range of increasing light stimulus intensities ( Figure 8B).

The partial loss of the RanBP2 chaperone activity in RanBP2 + / - mice also leads to deficits in the sequestration of HKI in the ellipsoid compartment of photosensory neurons.	"mice	66	70	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Regardless, lower levels of HKI likely contribute to the decreased levels in ATP, slower growth rates, and diminished ability to metabolize glucose of RanBP2 + / - mice ( Figures 5 - 7).	"mice	164	168	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 168, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This is further evidenced by the presence of genetic modifiers in RanBP2 + / - mice on a mixed genetic background that compensates for deficits in RanBP2 and deregulation of its partners in glucose / energy homeostasis as observed in the coisogenic line.

Finally, RanBP2 appears to join other nucleoporins, such as Nup96 [ 58], in novel physiological functions that are vital for complex organisms and that were not anticipated from cell - based studies.

The resulting mice heterozygous for the Alk5Flox and Alk5KO alleles, which also carried the Wnt1 - Cre transgene, had the Alk5 gene specifically inactivated in NCCs ( herein termed Alk5 / Wnt1 - Cre), while the littermates with remaining allelic combinations were phenotypically normal and served as controls ( Alk5Flox / +, Alk5KO / +; Wnt1 - Cre).

Although relevant Gdfs 8, 9 11 and 15 are not expressed in the developing heart, nor do the mice deficient in these Gdfs display developmental cardiac defects, we cannot exclude the possibility that circulating GDFs, perhaps in concert with TGF - beta s may contribute to NCC survival during cardiac and pharyngeal morphogenesis.

Since we could not detect appropriate rotation of the OFT in neural crest - specific mutants of Alk5 or Alk2, it appears that cells derived from the NC, as well as those from the SHF, are mutually required for proper OFT rotation in mice.

To circumvent these issues, we have constructed a series of mouse strains lacking one or more of these BMPs, using conditional alleles in the case of Bmp2 and Bmp4 to remove them specifically from the limb bud mesenchyme.

As noted above, BMP7 - deficient embryos produce mostly normal limbs, and mice harboring a conditional deletion of Bmp4 in the limb bud mesenchyme also do not show evidence of anterior digit transformation [ 16], as would have been predicted if BMP4 acted as an interdigital regulator of digit morphology.

In contrast, mice in which both copies of Bmp2 and one copy of Bmp4 had been removed ( Bmp2C / C; Bmp4 + / C; Prx1:: cre) showed more severe skeletal defects, including significantly thinner skeletal elements.

The skeletal phenotypes of mouse limbs formed in the absence of BMP2, BMP7, and both BMP2 and BMP7 are illuminating, as none of these exhibit significant digit pattern defects ( Figure 1).

While a distal phalanx was lost from the middle digit of the forelimbs of these animals, these digits do not otherwise have a morphology consistent with their being transformed anteriorly into digit 1 ( thumb).

Genes such as Msx2 ( Figure 3N) continue to be expressed throughout the posterior forelimb mesenchyme, indicating that the posterior forelimb tissue is viable at E12. 5 in the Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre animals.

The loss of the posterior forelimb digits in these mice thus does not appear to represent a decrease in polarizing activity leading to a change in digit identity rather a consequence of the overall level of BMP signaling falling below a threshold for initiating chondrogenesis in the posterior of these forelimbs.	"mice	51	55	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The skeletal elements in these various BMP - deficient animals contained normal prehypertrophic chondrocytes expressing type II collagen, hypertrophic chondrocytes expressing type X collagen, as well as the osteoblasts expressing type I collagen, like their wild - type counterparts ( Figure S2; compare Figure S2F - S2H with Figure S2B - S2D; and unpublished data).

To differentiate between a simple delay in bone formation in the absence of BMP2 and BMP4 and the inability to form bone without these BMPs, we performed histological analyses in Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre mice up to 3 wks of age.	"mice	212	216	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 212, ""end_span"": 216, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
As shown in Figure 6A through 6E, in the control mice, a bone collar is found adjacent to the zone of late hypertrophic chondrocytes at 1 wk ( Figure 6A and 6B).	"mice	49	53	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The resorption of bone at 3 wks of age is clearly visible in the proximal femur of mutant animals where a portion of that bone is missing ( Figure 6L, black arrow).	"animals	90	97	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The inability to complete osteoblast differentiation in the Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre mice results in strikingly defective limb morphology at 1 wk of age ( compare Figure S3G and S3H).	"mice	93	97	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In the control mice, osteoblasts lining the surface of trabecular and cortical bone express type I collagen, runx2, and osterix genes at both 1 wk and 3 wks after birth ( Figure 7A - 7D and 7I - 7L).	"mice	15	19	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Compensation by BMPs in the AER also likely explains a difference seen between the Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre mice in our experiments and a recently published analysis [ 16], which used the identical Bmp4 conditional allele and Prx1:: cre driver.	"mice	105	109	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The difference is that the mice analyzed in the previous report had one null allele and one conditional allele, while ours had two conditional alleles.	"mice	27	31	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Their mice, therefore, lost a half - dose of BMP4 from the AER in addition to complete loss in the mesenchyme, while our conditional alleles were only recombined in the mesenchyme by the Prx1:: cre driver.	"mice	6	10	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
[ 26] showed that if mice lose both Alk3 ( BmprIa) and Alk6 ( BmpIb), two of the three type I receptors used in BMP signal transduction, there is a dramatic decrease in the size of skeletal primordial due to a reduction of proliferation and increase in apoptosis.

"mice	306	310	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 306, ""end_span"": 310, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Because the preparations were made from whole testes, it is possible that the univalent - containing metaphases from Dmc1 - / - mice were from spermatogonia, not spermatocytes.	"mice	128	132	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
To determine if TRIP13 deficiency prevents apoptosis triggered by asynapsis as in C. elegans, we analyzed mice that were doubly mutant for Spo11 and Trip13.	"mice	106	110	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In mice, Spo11 - / - spermatocytes are severely defective in homologous chromosome synapsis [ 34, 35], and arrest with chromosomes in a state characteristic of the zygotene / pachytene transition ( Figure 3H).	"mice	3	7	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In yeast, deletion of PCH2 alleviates the pachytene arrest caused by asynaptic mutants zip1 and zip2 [ 8].	"yeast	3	8	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""yeast"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Although mouse SYCP1 might be a functional equivalent of Zip1p, because Sycp1 mutant spermatocytes arrest at approximately the same point as Trip13 mutants, there would be no opportunity to observe bypass of Sycp1 - / -.	"mouse	9	14	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These observations raise the possibility that in yeast, Pch2p responds to synapsis polymerization rather than initiation.	"yeast	49	54	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""yeast"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
As in the Spo11 and Mei1 experiments, histology of testes deficient for both REC8 and TRIP13 resembled the Rec8 mutant, with no evidence of progression to metaphase I that occurs in Trip13Gt / Gt mice ( Figure 3L and 3M).	"mice	196	200	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 196, ""end_span"": 200, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Although subsequent reports indicate otherwise [ 10, 12], deletion of PCH2 in yeast was originally reported to alleviate meiotic arrest caused by deficiency for the meiosis - specific RecA homolog DMC1 [ 8].	"yeast	78	83	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""yeast"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
As in Dmc1 - / - mice, in which spermatocytes undergo meiotic arrest from defective DSB repair and failed chromosome synapsis [ 16], spermatogenesis in Dmc1 - / - Trip13Gt / Gt testes was uniformly arrested at the point where spermatocytes contained chromatin characteristic of zygonema / pachynema ( Figure 3N).	"mice	17	21	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In conjunction with the immunohistochemical data, these data provide strong evidence that meiotic arrest in Trip13 mutant mice is due to defects in DSB repair.	"mice	122	126	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Our results demonstrate that in mice, the primary meiotic function of TRIP13 is in recombination itself.	"mice	32	36	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Mice also appear to have independent CO versus NCO recombination pathways [ 46].	"Mice	0	4	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Mice"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
As in yeast, both require SPO11 - induced breaks, but only the CO pathway requires MLH1.	"yeast	6	11	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""yeast"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Interestingly, RAD54 - deficient spermatocytes display abnormal persistence of RAD51 foci on pachytene chromosomes, similar to those in TRIP13 mice, but there are no deleterious effects on meiotic progression or fertility [ 49].	"mice	143	147	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 147, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Data from budding yeast also indicate that Pch2p functions in recombination.	"budding yeast	10	23	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""budding yeast"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Deletion of PCH2 delays meiotic progression by ~ 2 h in SK1 yeast, and causes a minor decrease in ascus formation [ 50].	"yeast	60	65	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""yeast"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
DSBs persist > 2 h longer in pch2 Delta yeast than in wild type, and hyperresection of DSBs in dmc1 Delta pch2 Delta double mutants is lower than in dmc1 Delta cells [ 10].	"yeast	40	45	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""yeast"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Additionally, it was reported that pch2 Delta yeast had a meiosis I delay dependent on the RAD17 - SAE2 checkpoint that monitors recombination intermediates [ 12].	"yeast	46	51	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""yeast"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These potential recombination roles might not be limited to meiosis, since Trip13 is widely transcribed and the mutant animals exhibited developmental defects.	"animals	119	126	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Thus, the Trip13 mutant provides the first evidence that unrepaired DNA damage alone can trigger the mammalian pachytene checkpoint response.	"mammalian	101	110	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mammalian"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
TRIP13 was originally discovered to be an interactor with rat thyroid receptor beta ( THRB; [ 54]), but the relationship between THRB and TRIP13 in meiosis is unknown.	"rat	58	61	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""rat"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Considering that THRB knockout mice are viable and fertile [ 56], the functional relationship between TRIP13 and its receptor THRB in meiosis is unclear.	"mice	31	35	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Given the high similarity of PCH2 orthologs throughout the eukaryotic world, one or more essential functions of this protein must be conserved.	"eukaryotic	59	69	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""eukaryotic"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Since TRIP13 does not exhibit checkpoint function in mice, we surmise that the TRIP13 / PCH2 ancestral protein had a function in recombination that persists to the present.	"mice	53	57	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
