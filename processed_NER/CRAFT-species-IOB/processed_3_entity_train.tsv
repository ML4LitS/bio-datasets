However, expression of calpains with these modified small subunits did not give rise to any detectable calpain activity when expressed in E. coli, although their functionality in mammalian cells has yet to be determined ( J.

However, using homologous recombination in ES cells to generate mutant mice is an inefficient, slow and expensive method because ( i) homologous recombination typically occurs at low frequency in ES cells, requiring sophisticated selection schemes and screening of hundreds of clones to identify the desired mutant; ( ii) large ( 15 - 20 kb) plasmids, often difficult to clone, are required to increase targeting efficiency and ( iii) breeding mice to homozygosity and housing a mouse colony generate further delays and costs.

The unusual relatedness between mammalian and plant PCH2 may therefore be attributable to both the presence of a common conserved function ( namely recombination, although the role of PCH2 in plants has yet to be determined), and the absence of checkpoint function.
