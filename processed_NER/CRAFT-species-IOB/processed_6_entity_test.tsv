In addition to the mammals, CLN2 - like enzymes are also found in fugu ( puffer fish - unannotated record SINFRUP00000077297 in the NCBI fugu sequence database,) and zebrafish ( contig wz4596. 2 in the zebrafish EST database,).

The discovery of highly conserved CLN2 - like enzymes not only in mammals but also in two fish species and one of frogs may indicate that these peptidases are universally present in the vertebrates, and that their important role identified in humans [ 2] and mice [ 14] might be a more general feature.
