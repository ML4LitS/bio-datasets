At the base of the chordate branch of life, a single TACC gene was identified in the genome of the urochordate Ciona intestinalis [ 11], and a partial TACC sequence from an analysis of the Halocynthia rortezi EST database [ 12].

"Thus, if the TACC genes were duplicated at both events, we would expect to identify four TACC genes in the most "" primitive "" compact vertebrate genome sequenced to date, the pufferfish Takifugu rubripes, with three genes corresponding to the human TACC1 - 3, and, in keeping with the proposed model for genomic duplication of the chromosomal loci for the TACC genes ( discussed below), a possible fourth gene deriving from the TACC3 ancestor."

This indicates that the RHAMM / TACC genes diverged after the protostome / deuterostome split 833 - 933 MYA, but prior to the echinodermata / urochordate divergence ( > 750 MYA).

Recently, detailed analyses of the chromosomal regions containing the FGFR gene family in humans, mouse and the arthopod D. melanogaster have revealed the conservation of paralogous chromosomal segments between these organisms ( Fig. 2, [ 13], Table 1 [ see Additional file 1]).

Interestingly, these three clusters are located on different chromosomes in mouse and rat ( Fig. 2), further suggesting that this cluster of genes was transposed into this region after the primate / rodent divergence.

The genomic DNA sequences corresponding to the orthologous TACC genes of human, mouse, rat, pufferfish, C. intestinalis, D. melanogaster and C. elegans were extracted and analyzed by Genescan and BLAST to determine the genomic structure of each TACC gene.

In the higher organisms, D. melanogaster, and the deuterostomes C. intestinalis to human, this feature is also encoded by the final exons of the gene ( five in D. melanogaster, seven in the deuterostome genes).

These repeats are not evident in the rabbit protein, or any other TACC protein, and may indicate that the rodent TACC3 has evolved distinct functions, as has already been noted for the amphibian Xenopus TACC3, maskin [ 8].

It is possible that there are gene regulatory differences between mice and humans such that in human NR2E3 mutants, S - opsin shows a type I pattern of derepression rather than a type II as in seen in the rd7 mouse, and is therefore expressed in all of the hybrid photoreceptor cells.

Furthermore, comparison of this animal model with human MSUD has shown some differences in the pathology of the disease [ 1], making this animal a less desirable model for the human disease.

This transgene contains the tetracycline responsive hCMV * - 1 promoter [ consisting of the tetracycline responsive element ( TRE) and a minimal hCMV promoter] [ 25] from pTRE2 ( Clontech Inc., Mt.
