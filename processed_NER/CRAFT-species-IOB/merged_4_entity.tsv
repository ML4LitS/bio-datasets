The animals were fed ad libitum with standard rodent chow ( LAB FOR R36, irradiated breeding food for rats and mice; Lactamin AB, Stockholm, Sweden) and water in a photoperiod of 12 hours: 12 hours light: dark.	animals,4,11,Organism	rodent,46,52,Organism	rats,102,106,Organism	mice,111,115,Organism	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""rodent"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""rats"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test

The rebleeding time ( Figure 4B), determined as the time between bleeding cessation and initiation of the second bleeding, was markedly increased in the A / J mice compared to the B6 mice and two strains, B6 - Chr11A / J ( CSS - 11) and B6 - Chr17A / J ( CSS - 17), had significantly ( P < 0. 002) longer rebleeding times compared to the B6 mice that were similar to values from the A / J mice.	mice,159,163,Organism	mice,183,187,Organism	mice,341,345,Organism	mice,389,393,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 163, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 183, ""end_span"": 187, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 341, ""end_span"": 345, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 389, ""end_span"": 393, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
