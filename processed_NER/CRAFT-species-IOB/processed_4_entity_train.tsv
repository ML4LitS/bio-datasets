Due to conservation in mammalian physiology and the powerful tools of mouse genetics, mice are a very important experimental system for probing the functions ( both in health and disease) of many genes recently identified by sequencing the human genome [ 12].

Expression levels are mostly consistent between different mice: we find similar expression - level differences between olfactory receptor genes in all three mice examined ( that is, the rank order of the six genes is similar among the three mice), although there is variation in expression level of some genes between mice ( for example, gene E, Figure 3).
