The objectives of the current report were to characterize gross morphology of young ( 5 wk) and old ( 54 wk) mouse lenses with targeted disruption of both the alphaA and alphaB genes, in comparison to age matched wild type lenses, using scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) and confocal microscopy, to elucidate the possible functions of alpha - crystallin in the lens.

Using genome - wide linkage analysis, we identified several susceptibility loci, derived from 129 and C57BL / 6 mice, mapped in the lupus - prone hybrid ( 129 x C57BL / 6) model.	"mice	112	116	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

In this context, both genetic linkage studies in spontaneous lupus - prone models and synthetic murine models of autoimmunity generated by targeted disruption of specific genes modulating the immune system have widely been used to investigate the complexity of SLE.	"murine	96	102	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""murine"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The best - studied strains of mice that spontaneously develop a lupus - like pathology are the New Zealand Black / New Zealand White hybrid strain ( NZB / WF1); the MRL / Mp lpr / lpr strain, which carries the lpr mutation of the FAS receptor gene; and the BXSB strain, which carries the Y chromosome autoimmune accelerator ( Yaa) gene ( Theofilopoulos and Dixon 1985).	"mice	30	34	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Although considerable efforts have been made to identify the genes responsible for the development of the disease, with the exception of the lpr mutation, none of the genetic contributions to disease in the three well - documented murine SLE strains have yet been fully resolved at the molecular or protein level.	"murine	231	237	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""murine"", ""start_span"": 231, ""end_span"": 237, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Furthermore, the genetic background markedly influences the autoimmune phenotype in gene - targeted mice ( Bolland and Ravetch 2000; Santiago - Raber et al. 2001; Mitchell et al. 2002).	"mice	100	104	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
To test this, we conducted a genome - wide scan analysis of two large cohorts of ( 129 x C57BL / 6) F2 mice, one of which carried a mutation in the serum amyloid P component gene ( Apcs).	"mice	103	107	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

As previously reported ( Botto et al. 1998), the wild - type ( 129 x C57BL / 6) F2 mice developed lupus traits with elevated levels of auto - Abs, starting from 6 mo of age ( data not shown), and histological evidence of proliferative glomerulonephritis.	"mice	83	87	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In agreement with our previous observations ( Bickerstaff et al. 1999), the titres of anti - nuclear Abs ( ANAs) and anti - chromatin Ab were considerably greater in the ( 129 x C57BL / 6) F2. Apcs - / - mice compared with the strain - matched controls.	"mice	204	208	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 204, ""end_span"": 208, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Mice were genotyped with 143 microsatellite markers distributed throughout the autosomes such that 98% of the genes were within 20 cM of an informative marker.	"Mice	0	4	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Mice"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Only linkages identified in both experimental groups are reported in Table 3, with the exception of the Chromosome 1 distal segment, where the linkage analysis could not be applied to the ( 129 x C57BL / 6) F2. Apcs - / - mice as this region was of fixed 129 origin.	"mice	222	226	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 222, ""end_span"": 226, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The quantitative trait linkage ( QTL) analysis identified several intervals on Chromosome 1 with linkage to disease serological markers, and these regions were all derived from the 129 mouse strain ( see Table 3; Figures 4 and 5).	"mouse	185	190	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 185, ""end_span"": 190, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Interestingly, whilst ANA and anti - chromatin Ab levels showed suggestive or significant linkages only to the telomeric region of Chromosome 1, with an estimated peak occurring at a position approximately 90 cM near the Apcs gene, anti - dsDNA or anti - ssDNA Ab production was also linked to other segments on Chromosome 1, indicating a more complex genetic contribution from the 129 mouse strain.	"mouse	386	391	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 386, ""end_span"": 391, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Guided by these observations, we investigated whether the increased levels of ANA and anti - chromatin Ab observed in the Apcs - / - mice were caused by a gene ( s) within the fixed 129 region surrounding the mutated Apcs gene, rather than caused by the mutated Apcs gene itself.	"mice	133	137	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The C57BL / 6 strain has previously been reported to be one of the murine strains defined as low Apcs producers ( Pepys et al. 1979; Baltz et al. 1980).	"murine	67	73	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""murine"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

We investigated further the effects of genes from the C57BL / 6 background by repeating the linkage analysis in ( 129 x C57BL / 6) F2 mice, whilst controlling for the very strong 129 effect on distal Chromosome 1, as previously described ( Zeng 1994).	"mice	134	138	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Histological evidence of glomerulonephritis was only found in approximately 20% of the mice in each cohort, which reduces the power of the QTL analysis for this disease trait.	"mice	87	91	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We generated a C57BL / 6 congenic line carrying the telomeric region of Chromosome 1 from the 129 mouse strain, in order to dissect the complex polygenic disease phenotype of the ( C57BL / 6 x 129 / Sv) F2 hybrid strain into its individual genetic components.	"mouse	98	103	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In the C57BL / 6. Apcs - / - mice, the 129 genome around the Apcs locus was mapped as a stretch of approximately 17 cM, positioned from 87. 9 cM ( D1Mit15) to 105 cM ( D1Mit17).	"mice	29	33	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Thus, the congenic line carried a similar 129 region ( 80 - 106 cM) to the one present in the C57BL / 6. Apcs - / - mice ( 87. 9 - 105 cM).	"mice	116	120	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

There is accumulating evidence that background genes may influence the expression of autoimmunity in gene - targeted mice.	"mice	117	121	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Here we report what is to our knowledge the first systematic study that has examined this in the 129 and C57BL / 6 mouse strains, widely used for gene targeting.	"mouse	115	120	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We also developed a congenic mouse strain bearing a portion of 129 Chromosome 1 on a C57BL / 6 background and showed that this wild - type congenic line expressed striking anti - nuclear autoimmunity.	"mouse	29	34	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
By comparing this Chromosome 1 congenic strain with matched congenic mice lacking the Apcs gene, we demonstrated that serum amyloid P component deficiency influences the severity of glomerulonephritis, but is not the prime mover in the induction of anti - nuclear autoimmunity, contrary to our own original interpretation of our data ( Bickerstaff et al. 1999).	"mice	69	73	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In MRL / Mp mice, the presence of the lpr gene accelerates the development of high level and broad - spectrum auto - Ab production and lethal glomerulonephritis, in addition to marked lymphoproliferative disease.	"mice	12	16	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Not surprisingly, important effects of the genetic background on the expression of autoimmunity have also been reported in gene - targeted mice ( Bolland and Ravetch 2000; Santiago - Raber et al. 2001; Mitchell et al. 2002).	"mice	139	143	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Through the use of microsatellite marker maps, the identification of murine SLE susceptibility intervals in experimental crosses has been made possible.	"murine	69	75	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""murine"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We have employed the same approach to analyse the genetic basis of disease inheritance in the ( 129 x C57BL / 6) hybrid strain, the most common genetic background in gene - targeted mice.	"mice	182	186	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 182, ""end_span"": 186, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Although spontaneous autoimmunity has not been documented in either of the pure 129 or C57BL / 6 strains, a spontaneous lupus - like phenotype has been described in ( 129 x C57BL / 6) hybrid strains ( Obata et al. 1979; Botto et al. 1998; Bickerstaff et al. 1999; Santiago - Raber et al. 2001), suggesting that the predisposition in these hybrid mice may arise as a result of the interaction between specific combinations of alleles inherited from both the 129 and C57BL / 6 parental strains.	"mice	346	350	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 346, ""end_span"": 350, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We showed that there are multiple genetic loci contributing to the disease and these are derived from both 129 and C57BL / 6 mice.	"mice	125	129	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Furthermore, the region on Chromosome 7 associated with the development of lupus nephritis has been linked to the same trait in other murine models of SLE ( Santiago et al. 1998; Morel et al. 1999; Xie et al. 2002), suggesting the possibility of shared susceptibility loci.	"murine	134	140	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""murine"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In the context of SLE susceptibility, one of the most consistently mapped non - MHC regions of the mouse genome is the telomeric Chromosome 1 segment, where several disease loci, designated Sle1 ( Morel et al. 2001), Nba2 ( Drake et al. 1995; Rozzo et al. 1996; Vyse et al. 1997), and Bxs3 ( Hogarth et al. 1998), have been mapped in lupus - prone strains.	"mouse	99	104	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The human serum amyloid P component binds avidly to DNA, chromatin, and apoptotic cells in physiological conditions in vitro ( Pepys 1974; Pepys and Butler 1987; Butler et al. 1990) and also to exposed chromatin and apoptotic cells in vivo ( Hintner et al. 1988; Breathnach et al. 1989; Familian et al. 2001).	"human	4	9	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We have previously reported that ( 129 x C57BL / 6). Apcs - / - mice spontaneously produce a wide range of ANAs and develop significant immune complex glomerulonephritis ( Bickerstaff et al. 1999).	"mice	64	68	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, in this study we found that only ANA and anti - chromatin Ab levels were significantly increased in the ( 129 x C57BL / 6) F2. Apcs - / - mice.	"mice	147	151	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
A possible explanation for this discrepancy may lie in the fact that the Apcs - / - mice analysed in the original study were generated from a limited number of founders and that this may have caused a nonrandom inheritance of the loci from the parental strains.	"mice	84	88	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In agreement with this, when we carried out a selective comparison between the ( 129 x C57BL / 6) F2. Apcs - / - mice and Chromosome 1 genetically matched controls, we failed to detect any significant difference in the levels of these two auto - Abs.	"mice	113	117	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Strong supportive evidence for this was provided by the analysis of the C57BL / 6 mice congenic for this 129 region.	"mice	82	86	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In each case, the autoimmune phenotype was described in mice in which the null mutation was generated in 129 embryonic stem cells and then backcrossed to the C57BL / 6 or another genetic background.	"mice	56	60	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Thus, in view of our findings, one may postulate that in each of these murine models of SLE, the effects of the targeted null gene were irrelevant.	"murine	71	77	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""murine"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Similar conclusions may apply to other gene - targeted animals carrying mutations of genes mapped in the 129 - derived susceptibility allele on Chromosome 7 ( O ' Keefe et al. 1996, 1999).	"animals	55	62	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The expression of anti - nuclear autoimmunity was identical comparing the congenic with the Apcs - / - mice.	"mice	103	107	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In support of this, the expression of the human C - reactive protein, an acute - phase protein closely related to Apcs, has been shown to delay the onset and severity of lupus nephritis in the NZB / W strain by preventing the deposition of immune complexes in the renal cortex ( Szalai et al. 2003).	"human	42	47	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Consistent with this, a polymorphism associated with reduced basal level of C - reactive protein has been reported to be linked to SLE in humans ( Russell et al. 2004).	"humans	138	144	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""humans"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Thus, whilst the lack of lupus nephritis in the congenic mice is consistent with the need for multiple susceptibility genes for the full expression of lupus, further studies will be required to fully elucidate the role of Apcs in the pathogenesis of renal damage.

Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is required for the normal development of almost all multicellular organisms and is a physiological mechanism for controlling cell number; as a result, structures that are no longer needed are deleted during development and abnormal cells are eliminated [ 1, 2].

To investigate in vivo the functions of the phosphatidylserine receptor Ptdsr, we generated a null allele in the mouse by gene targeting ( Figure 1a, 1b, 1c).	"mouse	113	118	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In contrast to previously described Ptdsr - knockout mice [ 31, 32], we used Bruce4 embryonic stem ( ES) cells for gene targeting [ 33], thus generating a Ptdsr - null allele in a pure, isogenic C57BL / 6J genetic background.	"mice	53	57	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The newly established knockout mouse line was named Ptdsrtm1Gbf ( hereafter referred to as Ptdsr - / -).	"mouse	31	36	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

Interbreeding of heterozygous mice showed that the mutation was lethal, since homozygous mutants were not detected in over 100 analyzed litters at weaning.	"mice	30	34	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We recovered fewer than the expected number of homozygous embryos from intercrosses of Ptdsr + / - mice.	"mice	99	103	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

Because we were able to recover Ptdsr - / - embryos until E18. 5, we investigated whether Ptdsr - knockout mice could be born alive.	"mice	107	111	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
To analyze in more detail the temporal and spatial expression patterns of Ptdsr, and to correlate expression patterns with observed pathological malformations, we made use of a Ptdsr - beta - geo gene - trap reporter mouse line generated from a Ptdsr gene - trap ES cell clone.

Some Ptdsr - / - mice ( 4. 5%) also displayed extensive brain malformations that resulted in externally visible head abnormalities, with occasional ectopic tissue outside the skull or exencephaly ( Figure 1f, h).

Consistent with the observations of Kunisaki and colleagues [ 32], we found severely blocked erythropoietic differentiation at an early erythroblast stage in the liver ( Figure 3f, 3l), suggesting an explanation for the grossly anemic appearance that we observed in our Ptdsr - / - mice.

To investigate further whether removal of apoptotic cells is impaired in Ptdsr - / - mice, we stained immunohistochemically for activated caspase 3 ( aCasp3) and analyzed additional organs and tissues where apoptosis plays a crucial role in tissue remodeling during development.	"mice	85	89	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Furthermore, when we continued our analysis of apoptotic cell clearance in vivo at E16. 5, E17. 5 and E18. 5 of embryonic development as well as in neonatal mice, the number and distribution of apoptotic cells was similar in both genotypes.

As already observed at E12. 5, analysis of aCasp3 - stained sections of the developing thymus, heart, diaphragm, genital ridge, eyes and retina convincingly showed that there was no impairment in apoptotic cell removal in Ptdsr - / - mice.

Analysis of aCasp3 - stained lung tissue from Ptdsr + / + and Ptdsr - / - mice at E17. 5 and P0 demonstrated that apoptosis was an extremely rare event during lung morphogenesis at this stage.

To determine whether macrophages from Ptdsr - knockout mice were impaired in the efficacy of apoptotic cell uptake in vitro, we performed phagocytosis assays with fetal - liver - derived macrophages ( FLDMs) and quantified their phagocytosis rates.

To analyze whether pro - inflammatory signaling is affected in Ptdsr - / - macrophages, we stimulated FLDMs from Ptdsr + / + and Ptdsr - / - mice with LPS and measured levels of tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( TNF - alpha) at different time points after stimulation ( Figure 8c).

Indeed, very recently we have obtained strong evidence that Ptdsr - knockout mice die as a result of defects in heart development that are associated with specific cardiopulmonary malformations; ( J.

In summary, our studies demonstrate that Ptdsr is required for normal tissue differentiation, especially during the mid - gestation period when we observed the most severe differentiation delays in several organs of Ptdsr - knockout mice.

To generate a general system capable of specifically testing genes for functions in skeletal joint development, we engineered transgenic mice to express Cre recombinase in developing joints ( Figure 1).

First, the conditional knockout mice had shorter ears that often lay flatter against their heads than controls ( controls 13. 1 +/- 0. 1 mm long, n = 38; mutants 11. 8 +/- 0. 2 mm, n = 11; p < 0. 0001).	"mice	32	36	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
BMP signaling is known to be required for growth of the external ear of mice ( Kingsley et al. 1992), and this phenotype likely reflects loss of Bmpr1a function in the fraction of ear cells that express the Gdf5 - Cre transgene.	"mice	72	76	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Most mutant mice also showed soft tissue syndactyly or retention of webbing between the first and second digits of their feet, a phenotype that was more frequent and more severe in the forelimbs ( 201 of 220, or 91%, of forefeet and 109 of 220, or 50%, of hindfeet).	"mice	12	16	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Finally, mutant animals showed obvious skeletal changes in whole - mount skeletal preparations.	"animals	16	23	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
For example, the second distal tarsal was fused to the central tarsal bone in every conditional knockout animal examined ( 18 of 18), a phenotype not observed in controls ( zero of 18) ( Figure 3B and 3C).

At birth, digit joints were generally indistinguishable from those in control animals; chondrocytes were abundant in articular regions and were surrounded by typical cartilage matrix with normal staining by Safranin O, a histological stain for proteoglycans ( Figure 5).	"animals	78	85	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

By 1 wk after birth, obvious differences began to be detected in the articular regions of mutant animals.	"animals	97	104	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, we saw no increase in the expression of Col1a1 in mutant articular cartilage, and no proliferation was detected in articular cells of either mutant or control animals ( unpublished data).

Instead, mutant mice showed histological signs of osteoarthritis, such as fibrillation of the articular surface ( Figure 7).	"mice	16	20	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
As previously seen in 1 - and 2 - wk - old animals, Safranin O staining and Agg and Col10 expression were all reduced in mutant articular regions of the forefeet and hindfeet by 7 wk of age, and the beginning signs of cartilage loss were observed ( unpublished data).	"animals	43	50	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This reduction of the meniscus can also be seen in sections from 7 - wk - and 9 - mo - old animals ( Figure 7E, 7H, 7K, and 7N, arrows).	"animals	91	98	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
At 7 wk of age the normally domed tibial epiphysis was flattened and depressed in the knees of mutant animals, markedly reducing the distance between the growth plate and articular surface ( Figure 7E and 7H, vertical bar).	"animals	102	109	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Articular cartilage was also thinner than in control animals, showed nearly complete absence of Safranin O staining, and was either acellular or beginning to fibrillate in many regions ( Figure 7F and 7I).	"animals	53	60	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The histological signs of joint arthritis were accompanied by functional impairments in both grasping ability and range of motion in mutant animals.	"animals	140	147	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 147, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Gdf5 - Cre / Bmpr1afloxP mutant animals showed a highly significantly reduced ability to grasp and remain suspended on a slender rod ( mean suspension time: controls 38 +/- 6 s, n = 39; mutants 6 +/- 3 s, n = 11; p < 0. 0001).	"animals	32	39	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Mutant mice also showed a clear decrease in the maximum range of mobility of two different joints in the digits, as assayed by passive manipulation ( MT / P1 joint: controls 100 +/- 0 degrees, n = 26; mutants 82 +/- 3 degrees, n = 8; p < 0. 0003; P1 / P2 joint: controls 152 +/- 1 degrees, n = 23; mutants 140 +/- 5 degrees, n = 6; p < 0. 05).

The structural, histological, marker gene expression, and functional changes in mutant mice demonstrate that BMPR1A is required for normal postnatal maintenance of articular cartilage.	"mice	87	91	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Mutations in two different ligands in the BMP family, Gdf5 and Gdf6, the Bmpr1b receptor, and in the human Noggin locus ( Storm and Kingsley 1996; Gong et al. 1999; Baur et al. 2000; Yi et al. 2000; Settle et al. 2003) also produce defects in joint formation at specific locations in the limbs.

Despite the normal appearance of articular regions and gene expression immediately after birth, Bmpr1a - deficient animals are unable to maintain the normal differentiated state of articular cartilage as they continue to develop and age.	"animals	115	122	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, several of the most prominent structural components of cartilage matrix fail to be maintained in mutant animals, resulting in decreased synthesis of Col2a1, Agg, and proteoglycans.	"animals	113	120	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In addition, close examination of the order of genes induced during chicken digit formation reveals that Sox9 turns on first, followed by Bmpr1b with L - Sox5, and then Sox6 and the cartilage matrix structural components Col2a1 and Agg ( Chimal - Monroy et al. 2003).	"chicken	68	75	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""chicken"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These results, together with the altered pattern of gene expression seen in our Bmpr1a - deficient mice, suggest that BMPR1A signaling may normally act to stimulate SOX9 by post - translational protein modification, or to induce L - Sox5 or Sox6 in cartilage to maintain expression of ECM components.

Although BMPs were originally isolated on the basis of their ability to induce ectopic bone formation, their presence in articular cartilage and strong effect on cartilage formation has stimulated interest in using them to repair or regenerate cartilage defects in adult animals ( Chang et al. 1994; Erlacher et al. 1998; Edwards and Francis - West 2001; Chubinskaya and Kuettner 2003).

However, the control mice used in this study were heterozygous for a null allele of Bmpr1a, and they showed little sign of osteoarthritis even late in life.	"mice	21	25	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

Mice deficient in NT - 3, its tyrosine kinase receptor, TrkC, or in TrkC - positive neuron - specific transcription factor Runx3 display severe ataxia associated with the absence of muscle spindles, and loss of proprioceptive neurons in dorsal root ganglia ( DRGs) or their axons ( Ernfors et al. 1994; Klein et al. 1994; Tessarollo et al. 1994; Fari n as et al. 1996; Liebl et al. 1997; Inoue et al. 2002; Levanon et al. 2002).

Previously noted chemoattractant action of the embryonic mouse maxillary process on trigeminal ganglion neurons ( Lumsden and Davies 1986) is now attributed to NT - 3 and brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF) ( O ' Connor et al. 1999).	"mouse	57	62	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In transgenic mice, which over - express NT - 3 under the nestin promoter in the central nervous system, the course of the proprioceptive afferents are altered and directed towards the regions with high levels of ectopic NT - 3 expression in the spinal cord ( Ringstedt et al. 1997).	"mice	14	18	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, earlier findings of normal proprioceptive afferent trajectories in chicken embryos despite injection of function - blocking NT - 3 antibody into the spinal cord ( Oakley et al. 1995) led them to discount this possibility.

Ectopic NT - 3 supplied using osmotic pumps and adenovirus - mediated expression induce sensory axon growth during regeneration ( Zhang et al. 1998, Bradbury et al. 1999, Oudega et al. 1999, Ramer et al. 2002), and induce axonal plasticity of corticospinal axons in injured adult spinal cord ( Zhou et al. 2003), where the sprouting axons from the intact site cross the midline towards the NT - 3 source on the lesion side of the spinal cord.

Previously, normal motor neuron innervation was rescued in NT - 3 KO animals by over - expressing NT - 3 selectively in their muscles ( Wright et al. 1997).	"animals	69	76	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
It appears that peripheral NT - 3 alone is sufficient for rescuing proprioceptive neurons in NT - 3 KO animals and proper axonal pathfinding in the spinal cord.	"animals	103	110	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, it is unclear whether NT - 3 is absent from the ventral spinal cords of these animals.	"animals	87	94	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Assays to determine whether any NT - 3 is present in the ventral horns of these mice would be informative.	"mice	80	84	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

Seventy - three percent of retrogradely labeled gastrocnemius muscle afferents were reported to be expressing TrkC RNA in the adult rat DRG, although some of these ( about 10%) may represent cutaneous innervation ( McMahon et al. 1994).	"rat	132	135	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""rat"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Based on the available evidence showing that all proprioceptive neurons are eliminated in NT - 3 or TrkC null mice, we think that TrkC staining in the tibial nerve mostly represents proprioceptive axons in the vicinity of their peripheral target.	"mice	110	114	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
They found that in the spinal cord of Er81 KO mice, ventral projections of proprioceptive axons were mostly absent, and very few axons made it to the ventral cord.	"mice	46	50	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
It is highly possible that a small but considerable number of DRG cells express the transcription factor Er81 and that their axons grow beyond the intermediate levels of the spinal cord in Bax / NT - 3 double KO mice.	"mice	212	216	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 212, ""end_span"": 216, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
While the phenotype of Er81 KO mice is quite dramatic, and most proprioceptive axons stop within the intermediate spinal cord, it is important to note that a few axons still find their way to the ventral spinal cord and target properly to the motor neurons ( Arber et al. 2000).	"mice	31	35	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
( 2003) also present observations from islet2DTA mice, which lack a significant portion of the motor neurons in the ventral cord.	"mice	49	53	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

Patel et al. argue that since motor neurons are absent in these mice, NT - 3 secreted by them could not be a signal for proprioceptive axons to enter the lateral motor columns.	"mice	64	68	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, there is no evidence showing that NT - 3 mRNA or protein expressed in the ventral spinal cord is exclusively from motor neurons, and there are no available data indicating that in islet2DTA mice, NT - 3 expression in the ventral spinal cord is abolished ( Yang et al. 2001; Pun et al. 2002).	"mice	199	203	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 199, ""end_span"": 203, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Studies in embryonic mice reported NT - 3 mRNA in the ventral horns of the spinal cord, but it is not definitive that both mRNA and protein are expressed solely by motor neurons.	"mice	21	25	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Our present results, along with those from transgenic mice with NT - 3 over - expression in ectopic regions of the spinal cord ( Ringstedt et al. 1997), argue for a role of NT - 3 in chemoattractant axon guidance of proprioceptive axons in the spinal cord.	"mice	54	58	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Lack of PV expression in Bax / NT - 3 KO mice suggests that PV expression might be responsible for proper axon targeting and muscle spindle differentiation.	"mice	41	45	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, no defects in axon pathfinding along the monosynaptic reflex arc or in muscle spindle differentiation have been noted in PV KO mice, which develop normally and show no apparent changes in their behavior or physical activity ( Schwaller et al. 1999).	"mice	136	140	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These observations suggest that axonal targeting defects in Bax / NT - 3 double KO mice cannot be simply due to lack of PV expression in proprioceptive cells.	"mice	83	87	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

This suggests that Mcm4 / 6 / 7 may bind to a replication bubble substrate with a 2 - fold symmetry as a double hexamer ( Figure 1A, see the lower scheme), in a manner similar to SV40 T - antigen ( 21).

Our previous studies have shown that the sequences containing periodic ( dT) n tracts derived from the human lamin B2 origin ( 48% thymine content) can serve as an efficient activator for the Mcm helicase on a bubble, and replacement of thymines with guanines abolished the helicase activation ( 13, 28).

The results in this report indicate that helicase action of Mcm4 / 6 / 7 on synthetic bubbles may depend on the presence of an unpaired region of sufficient length ( at least 40 nt), which may permit assembly of a double - hexameric complex on the substrate DNA, similar to SV40 T - antigen protein ( Figure 2A) ( 21).

The fact that our mice survive shows either that AQP2 - F204V possesses some residual water transporting ability or that there are AVP - independent pathways for water reabsorption.	"mice	18	22	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

Diminished response to dDAVP, diminished abundance of mature glycosylated protein in mutant animals, and the transport of a fraction of mutant protein beyond the ER in MDCK cells are all consistent with the notion that AQP2 - F204V misfolding is limited and that it may retain some residual water transporting activity.

"GluR - B depletion in forebrain was ectopically variable ( "" mosaic "") among individuals and strongly correlated with decreased olfactory memory in hippocampus and cortex."

The sense of smell is of paramount importance for rodents [ 1], for which rapid odor discrimination and long - lasting olfactory memory permits responses to predator and prey critical for survival.	"rodents	50	57	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""rodents"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Consequently, the behavioral analyses of olfactory capabilities in rodents are efficient, quantitative, and reproducible [ 2 - 4].	"rodents	67	74	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""rodents"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Hence, either GluR - B deficiency, or the expression of Q / R site - unedited GluR - B with a glutamine residue at the critical channel site, leads to increased Ca2 + permeability of AMPA channels, as amply demonstrated in gene - targeted mice [ 51, 53, 58, 60].	"mice	239	243	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 239, ""end_span"": 243, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Concerning this intended switch in AMPAR properties, mice lacking all GluR - B, however, show a widespread impairment in behavior, including lethargy, motor coordination problems, and deficits in exploratory activity [ 51], which preclude detailed behavioral analyses.	"mice	53	57	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Similarly, mice expressing ( in the entire brain) a substantial part of the GluR - B population in the Q / R site - unedited form become seizure - prone and die prematurely [ 53].	"mice	11	15	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Some of these problems can be partially overcome by use of spatially and temporally restricted expression systems [ 54 - 56], in particular the Cre - lox system, with Cre - recombinase expression in defined brain areas of gene - targeted mice carrying GluR - B alleles marked by loxP sites for Cre - mediated recombination [ 55, 57].

To allow for the mechanistic separation of olfactory learning, discrimination, and memory, we exploited a well - known phenomenon of transgenes, which concerns heterogeneous expression among different founder lines and even among genetically identical individuals of a given line.

"Although such "" mosaic "" expression is usually undesired, here we took advantage of it by ablating GluR - B via gene - targeted, floxed GluR - B alleles with the help of a transgenic mouse line with variegated Cre expression in forebrain."

"To explore the role of fast excitatory neurotransmission carried by GluR - B - containing AMPA channels in olfactory processes, we first analyzed mice that express part of the GluR - B population in a Q / R site - unedited form ( Figure 1A; termed "" GluR - B Delta ECS: FB ""; see also [ 58])."	"mice	146	150	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These mice carry, in addition to a wild - type GluR - B allele, a gene - targeted GluR - Bneo allele in which the intronic sequence critical for GluR - B pre - mRNA editing at the Q / R site is replaced by a floxed TK - neo gene, which severely reduces splicing of the modified intron and hence attenuates the expression of the GluR - Bneo allele [ 60].

As expected [ 53, 60], also in mice expressing postnatally forebrain - specific Q / R site - unedited GluR - B ( Q) subunits, Ca2 + permeability through AMPAR was increased and AMPAR currents showed rectification ( [ 58] and unpublished data).

Strikingly, GluR - B Delta ECS: FB mice showed more rapid learning and enhanced discrimination capabilities ( Figure 1C, group effect: F ( 1, 10) = 10. 2, p < 0. 01).	"mice	35	39	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

To ascertain if enhanced olfactory learning and odor discrimination may indeed correlate with the increased Ca2 + permeability of AMPA channels in the Q / R site - unedited form, we next analyzed GluR - B Delta FB mice, which lack GluR - B in forebrain.

The specific GluR - B depletion in GluR - B Delta FB mice can be monitored by immunohistochemistry ( see below) and immunoblotting.	"mice	53	57	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In addition, in contrast to the complete GluR - B knockouts, mice with forebrain - specific GluR - B depletion appeared normal throughout life with no developmental abnormalities, or difference in body size and weight in adulthood ( wild - type: 31. 0 g +/- 1. 2; GluR - B Delta FB: 28. 4 +/- 0. 9; each n = 10).	"mice	61	65	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Exploratory activity in an open field task was slightly increased in GluR - B Delta FB mice ( 3, 480 cm +/- 180, n = 11), compared with wild - type littermates ( 2, 512 cm +/- 96, n = 12, p < 0. 01).	"mice	87	91	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Motor coordination measured in an accelerating rotarod was somewhat impaired in the mutant mice ( wild - type: 156 s +/- 37, n = 6; GluR - B Delta FB: 37 s +/- 10, n = 6; p < 0. 05).	"mice	91	95	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Tests in the dark / light box revealed increased anxiety of GluR - B Delta FB mice ( latency of first exit: wild - type [ 17 s +/- 3], GluR - B Delta FB [ 97 s +/- 42], p = 0. 047; compartment changes: wild - type [ 17 s +/- 3], GluR - B Delta FB [ 7 +/- 2], p < 0. 05; time spent in lit compartment: wild - type [ 103 s +/- 10], GluR - B Delta FB [ 59 s +/- 19], p = 0. 051; each n = 6).	"mice	78	82	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Hence, unlike the complete GluR - B knockouts, GluR - B Delta FB mice show only very minor changes in general activity and no sign of any major developmental disturbance, thus allowing detailed, quantitative behavioral investigations.	"mice	65	69	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We therefore trained nine GluR - B Delta FB mice and nine littermate controls in the same automated associative go / no - go olfactory conditioning task described above.	"mice	44	48	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
"After habituation, GluR - B Delta FB and control mice were trained to discriminate between the "" simple "" monomolecular odors amylacetate and ethylbutyrate, and subsequently additionally on a "" difficult "" discrimination task consisting of similar binary mixtures of cineol and eugenol; and finally again on a "" simple "" discrimination task with the monomolecular odors pelargonic and valeric acid."	"mice	49	53	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Similar to GluR - B Delta ECS: FB, GluR - B Delta FB mice also showed enhanced learning and discrimination compared with controls ( Figure 2B; group effect: F ( 1, 16) = 6. 55; p < 0. 05).	"mice	53	57	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
"Consistent with this notion, differences between GluR - B Delta FB and control mice were not only larger if the detailed sampling pattern and discrimination index were investigated ( Figure 2C and 2D, group effect: F ( 1, 16) = 29. 5; p < 10 - 4), but in particular for the discrimination of binary mixtures with similar composition ( group effect: F ( 1, 16) = 27. 8; p < 10 - 4 for the mixture; FAA EB ( 1, 16) = 7. 0; p = 0. 02, and FPel Val ( 1, 16) = 5. 8; p = 0. 03 for the "" simple "" discrimination tasks; 3 - way ANOVA: F ( 6, 96) = 2. 9; p = 0. 01)."	"mice	79	83	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
As activity, measured by the intertrial interval, was not significantly different between genotypes ( F ( 1, 16) = 3. 1; p = 0. 1), and analysis of the lick frequency showed a tendency to reduced motivation of GluR - B Delta FB mice in this particular task ( F ( 1, 16) = 9. 2; p < 0. 01), we conclude that depletion of GluR - B in forebrain areas indeed resulted in increased olfactory learning and discrimination performances, rather than motivational alterations.

Furthermore, enhancement in odor discrimination in both GluR - B Delta ECS: FB and GluR - B Delta FB mice makes it likely that improvement in this task results from the common AMPAR property change mediated by the depletion of GluR - B and the lack of the Q / R site - edited GluR - B subunit, both resulting in Ca2 + - permeable AMPARs.

To probe olfactory memory in GluR - B Delta FB mice, six days after the end of the first training phase for odor discrimination ( amylacetate versus ethylbutyrate), the training trials for the third odor pair ( pelargonic versus valeric acid) were interleaved with unrewarded trials in which amylacetate or ethylbutyrate were again presented ( black bar in Figure 2C).

We observed that onset and extent of Cre - recombinase expression in different forebrain regions varied among individual TgCre4 mice ( Figure 3A), which could also be directly visualized by immunohistochemistry with a Cre - antibody ( unpublished data).	"mice	128	132	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
As this variability persisted after several backcrosses, and Southern blot analysis revealed no differences of transgene integration or number among animals ( Figure 3B), it could not be attributed to genetic differences but rather to epigenetic mechanisms.

Subsequently, protein was extracted from olfactory bulbs, cortical areas, and hippocampi from each mouse, and GluR - B protein was quantified ( Figure 4C).	"mouse	99	104	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

To obtain independent evidence for this spatial and mechanistic dissection of the roles of Ca2 + - permeable AMPARs, we expressed by transgenic means N - terminally green fluorescent protein ( GFP) - tagged GluR - B specifically in hippocampus and piriform cortex of GluR - B Delta FB mice ( Figure 5A and 5B).	"mice	285	289	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 285, ""end_span"": 289, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Analysis of beta - galactosidase activity and GFPGluR - B expression in brain sections of GluR - BRescue mice revealed expression in hippocampus and piriform cortex, whereas cortex, amygdala, and striatum only rarely showed any positive cells ( Figure 5B).	"mice	105	109	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Importantly, both the spatial pattern and intensity of GFPGluR - B expression were constant among all GluR - BRescue mice analyzed ( n = 11).	"mice	117	121	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Olfactory memory experiments with GluR - BRescue, and both GluR - B Delta FB and GluR - B2lox mice as controls, were performed as described above ( indicated with shaded symbols in Figure 6A).	"mice	94	98	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Memory was again highly reproducible in both GluR - B Delta FB ( 66 +/- 12%; n = 4) and GluR - B2lox ( 94 +/- 2%; n = 3) mice, compared with experiments performed earlier ( Figures 2E and 4A).	"mice	121	125	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In summary, GluR - BRescue mice showed both enhanced memory performances compared with GluR - B Delta FB ( overall ANOVA: F ( 2, 41) = 13. 6, p < 10 - 4; memoryRescue = 75 +/- 15%, n = 8; memory Delta FB = 66 +/- 14%, n = 22; p < 0. 05; Figure 6A), but were still impaired relative to GluR - B2lox controls ( memory2lox = 88 +/- 8%, n = 14; p < 0. 005), consistent with a partial rescue of the memory deficit by circumscribed transgenic GFPGluR - B expression in hippocampus and piriform cortex.	"mice	27	31	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In the olfactory memory experiments with GluR - B Delta FB animals, olfactory memory linearly depended on GluR - B expression in cortex and hippocampus with a slope of 9. 1 +/- 2. 5% ( cortex) and 8. 9 +/- 2. 0% ( hippocampus) increase in memory per 10% increase in protein ( Figure 4D).	"animals	59	66	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
A 9. 7% increase in GluR - B in these brain regions, as achieved by GluR - BRescue animals ( Figure 5), is thus predicted to increase olfactory memory by approximately 9% throughout the heterogeneous population ( blue line in Figure 6B).	"animals	83	90	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, odor discrimination ( measured by the discrimination index as in Figures 1, 2, and 4D) was as enhanced as in GluR - B Delta FB mice ( 0. 79 +/- 0. 05, mean +/- SEM compared with 0. 76 +/- 0. 02, p > 0. 7, Figure 6C), and improved relative to GluR - B2lox controls ( 0. 48 +/- 0. 06; Figure 6C; overall ANOVA: F ( 2, 41) = 17. 2, p < 10 - 5; post hoc Newman Keuls: p < 10 - 3), as expected if the enhanced discrimination phenotype is due to Ca2 + - permeable AMPARs in the olfactory bulb and unaffected by GluR - B expression in piriform cortex or hippocampus.	"mice	136	140	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We observed among individual mice a striking variability in olfactory memory performance but not in odor discrimination.	"mice	29	33	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

This was rather pronounced for GluR - B ( Q) - expressing mice, consistent with the overall stronger phenotypic consequences in comparison to GluR - B depletion, both when forebrain - selective ( [ 58], and this study) or global [ 53, 60].	"mice	58	62	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
"A detailed analysis of the sampling pattern [ 3], and in particular the analysis of discrimination tasks that involved "" simple "" dissimilar monomolecular odor pairs and "" difficult "" binary mixtures, were necessary to fully capture the characteristics of the olfactory discrimination phenotype for forebrain - specific GluR - B - depleted mice."

"Interestingly, transgenic expression of GFPGluR - B in GluR - B Delta FB mice ( genetic "" rescue ""), specifically in piriform cortex and hippocampus with no detectable expression in the olfactory bulb, did not alter enhanced discrimination and learning capabilities."	"mice	73	77	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This notion will be further tested in mice with piriform cortex - specific GluR - B ablation.	"mice	38	42	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In both mouse models Ca2 + influx through AMPA channels is increased, whereas the effect on the macroscopic AMPA conductance differs.	"mouse	8	13	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
AMPAR currents are reduced in mice not expressing GluR - B [ 51], possibly due to fewer synaptic AMPA channels and impaired AMPAR trafficking and recycling.	"mice	30	34	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In mice expressing the unedited form of GluR - B ( Q), macroscopic conductance in whole - cell patches of CA1 pyramidals is increased [ 60], but excitatory transmission in CA3 - to - CA1 cell synapses is somewhat reduced, in spite of a lower threshold for generating a population spike [ 58], indicating increased synaptic excitability by sustained GluR - B ( Q) expression, in line with the seizure - prone phenotype.	"mice	3	7	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Yet, both mouse models yield enhanced discrimination and learning capability.	"mouse	10	15	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This is further supported by kainate - induced Co2 + uptake in acute brain slices, revealing considerably higher Co2 + uptake via Ca2 + - permeable AMPARs in hippocampal pyramidal neurons of mice expressing GluR - B ( Q), than those lacking GluR - B ( DRS, RS, and PHS, unpublished data).	"mice	191	195	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 191, ""end_span"": 195, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
"Increased inhibition will thus in general improve discriminability, consistent with the behavioral improvements observed with GluR - B ( Q) expression, the GluR - B knockout, and the "" rescue "" mice."

Prolonged behavioral tasks such as the assessment of long - term olfactory memory were not performed with the seizure - prone GluR - B Delta ECS: FB mice.	"mice	149	153	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 149, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Memory in GluR - B Delta FB mice, however, was dramatically impaired.	"mice	28	32	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Finally, in other memory - related tasks, such as a hippocampus - dependent spatial reference memory task ( Figure S2), mice with GluR - B depletion were not impaired after task acquisition.	"mice	120	124	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
To dissect the discrimination, learning, and memory phenotypes, and ultimately identify potential cellular correlates, we made use of the variegated Cre expression of TgCre4 mice.	"mice	174	178	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 174, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Therefore, residual GluR - B levels were determined from each mouse that had been tested in the behavioral experiments, and levels were correlated with odor learning, discrimination, and olfactory memory.	"mouse	62	67	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In particular, extensive lesions to the hippocampal formation in rats do not interfere with long - term olfactory memory in go / no - go successive olfactory discrimination tasks [ 72], such as the one described.	"rats	65	69	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""rats"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Surprisingly, in GluR - B Delta FB mice no LTP changes could be observed in field measurements in the hippocampus, nor could NMDA - independent LTP be induced in hippocampal synapses between Schaffer collaterals and CA1 pyramidal cells in presence of the NMDA antagonist APV ( K. Jensen, O. Hvalby, personal communication).	"mice	35	39	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
A critical step in discerning the discrimination and learning phenotypes from the memory phenotype was the observation of increased variability in the memory of the GluR - B knockout animals and, subsequently, the individual analyses of protein expression levels.	"animals	183	190	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 183, ""end_span"": 190, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
To achieve this, we made use of the epigenetic variability in the extent of GluR - B ablation, which correlated with the variability in odor memory, but not in discrimination and learning; this finding was subsequently confirmed in GluR - B rescue mice with piriform cortex - specific transgenic expression of GluR - B.

On close examination, a very faint band similar in size to full - length signal was also observed in those mice, probably due to a low amount of residual full - length Mtf1 mRNA.	"mice	107	111	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The level of functional MTF - 1 protein was examined by EMSA ( Figure 1c): MTF - 1 protein - DNA complex was detectable with liver protein extract from an Mtf1loxP control mouse, but no functional MRE - binding protein was observed with an Mtf1Mx - cre sample.

As a control, no binding to MRE1 was detected with extract from a pI - pC - induced Mtf1Mx - cre mouse, confirming that the bandshift was indeed dependent on the presence of MTF - 1.	"mouse	97	102	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The Ndrg1 microarray results were confirmed with semiquantitative RT - PCRs ( Figure 3a): for Mtf1loxP control livers, a clear increase of Ndrg1 expression was observed after cadmium exposure; in livers from Mtf1Mx - cre mice, this cadmium response was not detectable, while basal expression was similar to controls.

In contrast, no cadmium response was detectable in livers from Mtf1Mx - cre mice, suggesting that MTF - 1 is required for cadmium induction of Csrp1.	"mice	76	80	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In accordance with microarray data, semiquantitative RT - PCRs showed a downregulation of Slc39a10 expression in livers of Mtf1loxP mice upon cadmium exposure.	"mice	132	136	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

To analyze the role of the glutathione system in the cellular cadmium response, mouse embryonic fibroblasts with and without functional Mtf1 were treated with cadmium in combination with BSO, a specific inhibitor of glutamate - cysteine ligase ( 31), and cell viability was assessed by a colorimetric assay based on the tetrazolium salt MTT ( Figure 6).

In accordance with this, ectopic expression of mouse Sepw1 renders cells resistant to hydrogen peroxide, and this resistance is dependent on it binding glutathione ( 36).	"mouse	47	52	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This response was dependent on an overlapping - inverted MRE sequence located proximal to the rat Sepw1 transcription start ( 49), even though initial studies failed to demonstrate MTF - 1 binding to that sequence ( 50).

A previous target gene search for MTF - 1 with mouse embryos of conventional Mtf1 knockout phenotype revealed, besides metallothionein genes, the multifunctional alpha - fetoprotein ( Afp) and the liver - enriched transcription factor CCAAT / enhancer binding protein alpha ( Cebpa) as prime candidates ( 65).

In non - BC individuals, based on the r2 values from Pearson ' s correlation analysis, CEBPG accounts for much of the variance in expression of XRCC1 ( 69%), ERCC5 ( 62%), GSTP1 ( 55%), SOD1 ( 44%), and GPX1 ( 52%).

We used the tet - off transgene system to express a double mutant version of chimeric mo / huAPP695 ( swe / ind KM570, 571NL, and V617F) from a tetracycline - responsive promoter [ 12, 13].	"mo	86	88	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mo"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
After initial screening of founders, we identified four lines of tet - APPswe / ind mice that produced very high levels of transgene product in offspring coexpressing tTA ( Figures 1 and Figure S1).	"mice	84	88	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This estimate was confirmed by direct comparison of APP levels in nontransgenic and tet - off APP mice using an antibody that recognizes both endogenous APP ( and amyloid precursor - like protein 2) and the transgenic protein ( monoclonal antibody 22C11; Figure 1D).	"mice	98	102	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Importantly, all four new lines of tet - off APP mice showed nearly complete suppression of the transgene following dox treatment ( Figures 1 and Figure S1).	"mice	49	53	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Two dox - treated groups were compared to two untreated groups: one group of mice was born and raised on dox, a second group was treated with dox for 2 wk starting at 1 mo of age ( 4 wk + 2 wk dox); two untreated groups kept on normal chow were harvested at either 4 or 6 wk of age.	"mice	77	81	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

The residual expression remaining in acutely treated mice represents less than 4% of the transgenic protein produced in the absence of dox ( Figure 1C), and likely results from slight leakage at the level of transcription ( data not shown).	"mice	53	57	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
To ensure that A beta production was suppressed in concert with the dox - mediated inhibition of its precursor APPswe / ind, we measured A beta 40 and A beta 42 levels by ELISA in forebrain homogenates from young tet - off animals.	"animals	223	230	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 223, ""end_span"": 230, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
At 1 mo of age, the mice lacked visible amyloid aggregates that might act as an intractable reservoir of peptide remaining in the brain after the transgene had been suppressed.	"mice	20	24	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Consistent with the reduction in full - length APPswe / ind synthesis shown by immunoblot ( see Figure 1), we found that transgene - derived A beta levels were completely suppressed in animals born and raised on dox, and were sharply reduced following acute ( 2 wk) antibiotic treatment.	"animals	185	192	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 185, ""end_span"": 192, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Compared to the levels in untreated 4 - wk - old mice, PBS - soluble A beta 42 dropped by 95. 2% following 2 wk of dox treatment and by 99. 2% with chronic treatment ( Figure 2A).	"mice	49	53	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Only the FA fraction revealed a small dox - resistant pool of peptide in acutely treated animals that we believe represents stable predeposit aggregates that have already accumulated by 4 wk of age when treatment was begun ( Figure 2C).	"animals	89	96	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The ELISA data also confirmed that incorporation of the Swedish and Indiana mutations led to high levels of A beta 42, which we predicted would induce rapid plaque formation in untreated animals.

Histological characterization of double transgenic ( CaMKII alpha - tTA x tet - APPswe / ind) mice revealed early - onset amyloid formation in all four new lines.	"mice	94	98	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Amyloid plaques were seen in mice as young as 8 wk of age ( data not shown).	"mice	29	33	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We have noted the same early appearance of cored deposits in other lines of APP transgenic mice that harbor the Swedish mutation [ 27].	"mice	91	95	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Diffuse plaques were apparent in 6 - mo - old tTA / APP mice, and became relatively abundant by 9 mo of age.	"mice	56	60	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
At older ages ( 9 - 12 mo) amyloid deposits were visible in the thalamus, which has also been observed in mice expressing mutant APP via the Thy - 1 promoter.	"mice	106	110	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Most importantly, only double transgenic mice, expressing both the tTA and APP transgenes, developed amyloid lesions.	"mice	41	45	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Single transgenic mice up to 15 mo of age showed no sign of pathology ( Figure S3).	"mice	18	22	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Similarly, amyloid pathology can be completely prevented in double transgenic animals born and raised on dox.	"animals	78	85	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Animals from our highest expressing line ( line 885) maintained on dox for up to 1 y harbored no amyloid pathology ( data not shown), indicating that residual leakage of transgene expression in the presence of dox does not provide sufficient A beta peptide to induce amyloid formation even over long periods.	"Animals	0	7	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Animals"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
To mimic therapeutic intervention with inhibitors of A beta production, we raised a group of 25 double transgenic mice ( CaMKII alpha - tTA x APP line 107) on normal food until 6 mo of age, when we knew amyloid formation was already well underway in the brain.	"mice	114	118	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
At 6 mo, half of the animals were switched from normal chow to food containing dox at 200 mg / kg until they were sacrificed at 9 or 12 mo of age.	"animals	21	28	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The remaining control animals were kept on standard chow ( untreated).	"animals	22	29	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Full suppression ( > 95%) of transgenic APPswe / ind levels in the dox - treated animals was confirmed by immunoblot ( Figure 3).	"animals	81	88	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Tissue sections from each animal in the four treatment groups were stained for amyloid pathology by Hirano silver, Campbell - Switzer silver, thioflavin - S, and A beta immunohistochemistry.	"animal	26	32	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animal"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In contrast, the extent of amyloid pathology in mice from the 6 mo + 3 mo treated or 6 mo + 6 mo treated cohorts closely resembled that of the 6 mo untreated cohort, despite the significant age difference between the treated and untreated groups ( Figures 4 and Figure S3).	"mice	48	52	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Well - formed plaques remained in the treated animals after 6 mo of transgene suppression, even though as much time was given to clear the lesions as they had taken to form.	"animals	46	53	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Again, long - term dox treatment was begun at 6 mo of age, and mice were harvested after 3 mo of transgene suppression ( 6 mo untreated, n = 8; 9 mo untreated, n = 6; 6 mo + 3 mo treated, n = 8).	"mice	63	67	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Immunoblotting for APP confirmed full transgene suppression in the treated animals ( Figure S5).	"animals	75	82	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Both silver - and thioflavin - S - positive plaques could still be found in each of the dox - treated animals.	"animals	102	109	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Consistent with our visual analysis of the histological sections, line 107 tTA / APP mice treated with dox for 3 or 6 mo had the same amount of aggregated A beta as when they started treatment at 6 mo of age ( Figure 4A and 4B).	"mice	85	89	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In contrast, untreated 9 - mo - old mice had almost twice as much aggregated A beta as either of the treated groups.	"mice	36	40	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Cortical homogenates were sequentially extracted to separate peptide into PBS -, SDS -, and FA - soluble fractions, then transgene - derived A beta 40 and A beta 42 were measured by human - specific ELISA [ 23].	"human	182	187	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 182, ""end_span"": 187, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In all animals harboring amyloid deposits, we found that the vast majority of A beta ( > 99%) was extracted into the SDS and FA fractions ( Figure 5A and 5B).	"animals	7	14	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 7, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, brains of both 6 mo + 3 mo and 6 mo + 6 mo treated cohorts contained roughly twice as much PBS - soluble A beta 40 as untreated 6 - mo - old mice ( Figure 5C).	"mice	150	154	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Similarly, activated astrocytes immunostained for GFAP were found near plaques in all animals ( Figure 6).	"animals	86	93	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Neuritic and glial pathology were more severe in the older untreated mice.	"mice	69	73	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In contrast, transgene suppression prevented the growth of individual deposits apparent in untreated mice, and limited the surrounding pathology to what was already present when treatment began.	"mice	101	105	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
An obvious question we sought to address was whether the deposition of A beta diminished cognitive ability in untreated mice, and what might happen to cognition when the process was interrupted.	"mice	120	124	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Unfortunately, efforts to characterize cognitive behavior were compromised by severe hyperactivity in untreated double transgenic mice.	"mice	130	134	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In our case, the penetrance of hyperactivity was close to 100%, leaving us with no testable animals.	"animals	92	99	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This phenotype has not affected previous lines of APPswe mice we have produced, such as lines E1 - 2 or C3 - 3, that express lower levels of transgenic protein.	"mice	57	61	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
As shown in Figure 7, the double transgenic mice were up to 10 - fold more active during the dark phase of the day - night cycle than any of the control groups.	"mice	44	48	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, even during the light phase, the tTA / APP mice remained many - fold more active than normal controls.	"mice	52	56	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In contrast, hyperactivity was completely abolished by rearing tTA / APP mice on dox.	"mice	73	77	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Animals born and raised on dox showed activity levels similar to the untreated controls ( Figure 7C).	"Animals	0	7	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Animals"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Intriguingly, all of the dox - reared animals, both transgenic and wild - type, showed altered circadian rhythms with far less distinction between their day - and nighttime activity levels.	"animals	38	45	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We present a new mouse model for AD that was designed to test the consequences of inhibiting A beta production after the onset of amyloid pathology.	"mouse	17	22	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
New lines of transgenic mice were developed for this study that express high levels of APPswe / ind under the control of a tetracycline - responsive promoter.	"mice	24	28	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Transgenic expression of APPswe / ind and consequent overproduction of A beta 42 cause early - onset amyloid deposition in untreated mice, in which deposits appear as early as 2 mo of age.	"mice	133	137	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Amyloid burden worsens significantly with age, and by 9 mo, the hippocampus and cortex of untreated mice are largely filled with aggregated peptide.	"mice	100	104	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Importantly, this outcome occurs in animals already harboring considerable amyloid pathology, a situation similar to what might be expected in patients to be treated with secretase inhibitors.	"animals	36	43	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Two independent compounds tested in Tg2576 [ 33] and TgCRND8 [ 34] transgenic mice show no more than 85% suppression of A beta 40 levels, and where measured, even less suppression of A beta 42 ( approximately 60%) [ 35, 36].	"mice	78	82	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Thus, even after accounting for the much higher APP expression levels in our mice than in the Tg2576 and TgCRND8 lines, we have achieved better absolute suppression of A beta production with the tet - off system than is currently possible with published gamma - secretase inhibitors.	"mice	77	81	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We examined a small number of animals after 12 mo of dox treatment ( beginning at 6 mo of age), and found that amyloid deposits were still relatively abundant.	"animals	30	37	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
At the latest treatment interval analyzed by ELISA, animals administered dox for 6 mo showed elevated levels of PBS - soluble A beta ( see Figure 5) that could be interpreted as an indication that the plaques are slowly releasing peptide ( or oligomeric A beta) into the soluble pool and might eventually dissolve.	"animals	52	59	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, our data suggest that once diffuse deposits are formed in these mice, they are no more easily cleared in our system than cored plaques ( see Figure S4).	"mice	73	77	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
An additional consideration we recognize is that a small amount of transgene expression continues in the presence of dox and that endogenous mouse A beta continues to be produced.	"mouse	141	146	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, these low levels of peptide are not sufficient to induce new amyloid formation, as CaMKII alpha - tTA x tetAPPswe / ind mice raised on dox for up to a year do not develop amyloid lesions ( data not shown).	"mice	129	133	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
It is also clear that in this genetic system, we have raised the production of A beta to levels not found in humans to accelerate pathology into an experimentally feasible time frame.	"humans	109	115	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""humans"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Resident microglia in transgenic mouse models localize to tissue surrounding plaques but show little evidence of amyloid engulfment [ 37 - 40].	"mouse	33	38	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In contrast, microglia surrounding amyloid plaques in human brain show a much higher state of activation with greater expression of complement receptor [ 40].	"human	54	59	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Thus, the role of microglia in amyloid metabolism is minor in transgenic models compared to the human condition.	"human	96	101	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Even so, we considered the possibility that chronic dox treatment may have altered the activation state of microglia in our treated mice.	"mice	132	136	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, if dox does have anti - inflammatory activity, then, based on previous studies with other anti - inflammatories, we would have expected to find less amyloid in the dox - treated animals.	"animals	187	194	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 187, ""end_span"": 194, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
While it is possible that dox acts in some other way to slow amyloid clearance, data from multiple studies demonstrate that microglial responses are normally weak in the mouse AD models [ 37 - 40], and thus it is doubtful that dox - mediated microglial inhibition affected the outcome of our study.	"mouse	170	175	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 170, ""end_span"": 175, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The persistence and stability of amyloid deposits in our system is unexpected given the speed with which A beta aggregates are cleared in other mouse models of therapeutic intervention.	"mouse	144	149	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
More recently, an alternative approach has shown that lentiviral transfer of neprilysin can also reduce the number of aggregates in the area of the injection site [ 54].	"lentiviral	54	64	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""lentiviral"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, it has been noted that deletion of the Fc receptor ( the primary receptor for microglial opsinization of antibody - antigen complexes) in APP transgenic mouse models has no impact on the effectiveness of antibody - mediated therapy [ 56, 57].	"mouse	162	167	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 162, ""end_span"": 167, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
It is, nevertheless, possible that lack of microglia activation is the major difference between the slow clearance described here, where no perturbation of the immune system is expected, and the rapid clearance described in studies involving antibody or viral injection.	"viral	254	259	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""viral"", ""start_span"": 254, ""end_span"": 259, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Consistent with this hypothesis, strong activation of microglia through transgenic expression of TGF beta [ 58] or central injection of lipopolysaccharide [ 59, 60] can by itself substantially reduce plaque burden in APP transgenic mice.	"mice	232	236	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 232, ""end_span"": 236, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
As in our tet - off APP mice, SantaCruz et al. found that tau neurofibrillary tangles, like amyloid plaques, are not cleared efficiently following transgene suppression.	"mice	24	28	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The lack of clearance in both models of AD pathology comes as a stark contrast to the rapid removal of protein aggregates found in similar tet - off mouse models of Huntington [ 32] and prion disease [ 62].	"mouse	149	154	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 149, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Studies from the tet - off tau mice suggest that protein clearance may in fact not be required for cognitive improvement following transgene suppression [ 61].	"mice	31	35	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
At present, because of unexpected noncognitive behavioral abnormalities, it is not clear whether the tet - off APP mice can be used to address the same question in the context of amyloid pathology.

Both lines of tTA / APP mice we studied here display extreme hyperactivity visible as cage circling and quantified by activity monitoring ( see Figure 7).	"mice	24	28	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

Even at later stages in the disease, the presence of substantial microglial activation in human AD [ 40] suggests that simply slowing the formation of new amyloid deposits may allow ongoing phagocytosis to diminish preexisting lesions.

Turning off APP in these mice had the same effect as treating them with A beta - lowering drugs, and so the researchers were able to ask what happened to the amyloid plaques after A beta production was shut down.

To analyze the role of chromatin assembly factor 1 ( CAF - 1) during pre - implantation development, we generated a mouse line carrying a targeted mutation in the gene encoding its large subunit, p150CAF - 1.

In wild - type blastocysts and in mouse somatic cells, pericentric heterochromatin domains cluster together and form higher - order chromatin structures called chromocenters [ 20], which are visualized as DAPI - dense foci ( Figure 1C).

Surprisingly, we did not observe this severe alteration in heterochromatin organization in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs) following p150CAF - 1 depletion by RNAi.	"mouse	99	104	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Previous studies performed in mammalian cell lines showed that CAF - 1 activity is required for S phase progression [ 16, 23, 24].	"mammalian	30	39	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mammalian"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In order to better characterize the defects in heterochromatin organization, we performed two - color DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH) experiments to reveal the spatial distribution of pericentric and centric chromosomal regions, which in mouse are mainly composed of large blocks of major and minor satellite repeats, respectively [ 20].

Indeed, in Arabidopsis thaliana, in which CAF - 1 is not essential for viability [ 36], loss of CAF - 1 is associated with a mild alteration in chromocenter size [ 37].
