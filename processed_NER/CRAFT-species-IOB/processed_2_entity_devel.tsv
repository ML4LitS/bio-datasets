While identification of Mcoln1 is crucial to the development of mouse models for MLIV, the fact that there are two transcripts in mice suggests an additional or alternate function of the gene that may complicate phenotypic assessment.

Correspondence with the Joint Genome Institute and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ( LLNL) Human Genome Center confirmed the location of this BAC to mouse chromosome 8 and allowed us to construct a physical map of this region [ 14] ( Fig. 1A).

Mouse adult multiple tissue and embryonic Northern blots were hybridized using a probe generated from mouse exon 2 ( probe 1, Fig. 1B), yielding a band of approximately 2. 4 kb ( isoform 1), as expected, and a less abundant and unexpected 4. 4 kb band ( isoform 2) ( Figs. 3A & 3B).

Since the human MCOLN1 gene encodes a single transcript [ 7 - 9], we carried out additional hybridizations with probes generated from various regions of the coding sequence and 3 ' UTR, and all probes identified the same two transcripts in the mouse ( data not shown).

Next, we directly compared the nucleotide and amino acid sequence of the alternatively spliced mouse transcript to the entire human MCOLN1 genomic sequence and found no significant similarity.

However, our results suggest that phenotypic assessment of Mcoln1 knock - out mice may be complicated and that care must be taken when interpreting data on mouse gene expression and phenotype.

Mouse embryo multiple - tissue northern blot and mouse adult multiple - tissue northern blot filters were purchased from Clontech Laboratories ( Palo Alto, CA).

Among vertebrates, differences in the shape or number of skeletal elements, altered morphology of epidermal appendages, and variation in pigment distribution combine to produce the majority of what distinguishes one animal from another.

In rodents and probably other mammals, this dorsoventral difference in hair color is brought about by differences in pigment type as determined by allelic variation of the Agouti gene ( Bultman et al. 1992; Miller et al. 1993).	"rodents	3	10	Organism"	"mammals	30	37	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""rodents"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mammals"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Agouti protein has a short radius of action ( Silvers and Russel 1955) and can be switched on and off during a single hair cycle ( Bultman et al. 1992, 1994; Miller et al. 1993; Vrieling et al. 1994); thus, its regulated expression is thought to be responsible for the cream - colored or yellow ventral surface of mice carrying the black - and - tan ( at) allele and for the yellow markings around the feet, ears, or head, i. e., tan points or head spots, of certain dog breeds.	"mice	314	318	Organism"	"dog	467	470	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 314, ""end_span"": 318, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""dog"", ""start_span"": 467, ""end_span"": 470, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The boundary between dorsal and ventral color compartments in at / at mice bears superficial resemblance to dorsoventral boundaries apparent for many other mammals, but morphogenetic differences between dorsal and ventral skin seem likely to include more elements than the type of pigment made by hair follicle melanocytes.	"mice	70	74	Organism"	"mammals	156	163	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mammals"", ""start_span"": 156, ""end_span"": 163, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In age - matched inbred mice, we observed a small decrease in the ratio of undercoat hairs ( zigzags) to overcoat hairs ( auchenes, awls, and guard hairs) in dorsum compared to ventrum ( Figure 1E), but there was no consistent difference in hair - type distribution for outbred mice ( data not shown).	"mice	24	28	Organism"	"mice	278	282	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 278, ""end_span"": 282, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Differences between dorsal and ventral pigmentation of at / at mice are usually attributed to pigment - type differences caused by ventral - specific expression of Agouti, but animals homozygous for a null allele of Agouti, extreme nonagouti ( ae), have ventral hairs that contain less melanin than dorsal hairs, giving a slightly paler appearance to the ventral coat ( Figure 1G).	"mice	63	67	Organism"	"animals	176	183	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 176, ""end_span"": 183, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
By contrast, skin from at / at mice reveal an abrupt dorsoventral transition of DOPA staining, which probably reflects the additive effects of reduced melanin content ( as in ae / ae mice) and downregulation of tyrosinase activity induced by Agouti.	"mice	31	35	Organism"	"mice	183	187	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 183, ""end_span"": 187, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
An abnormal dorsoventral pigment pattern is readily apparent in at / at; deH / deH mice, but comparison to nonmutant animals is more accurately described in terms of ventral, lateral, and dorsal regions ( Figures 1G and 2A).	"mice	83	87	Organism"	"animals	117	124	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The lateral region contains yellow hairs of progressively increasing length; in at / at mice, the lateral region appears as a thin yellow stripe along the flank, but in at / at; deH / deH mice, the lateral region is considerably expanded with a diffuse boundary along the dorsal flank, and a dorsal eumelanic region whose size is correspondingly reduced ( Figure 2A and 2B).	"mice	88	92	Organism"	"mice	188	192	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 188, ""end_span"": 192, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Total body size is smaller in mutant compared to nonmutant animals, but the proportion of body circumference occupied by the lateral region in mutant animals is increased about 2 - fold, from 11. 9% to 22. 2% ( Figure 2C).

We used an F2 intercross with CAST / Ei mice to localize deH to a 0. 1 cM interval between D3Mit213 and 16. MMHAP32FLF1, which was refined by development of a bacterial artificial chromosome ( BAC) contig and additional markers to a 1. 4 Mb region that contained eight genes, including Tbx15 ( Figure 3A).

However, the deletion removes 534 of the 602 amino acids encoded by Tbx15 ( including the T - box DNA - binding domain), deH / + animals are grossly normal, and the phenotype of deH / deH animals is identical to that described for the original allele.

We generated Tbx15LacZ / deH compound heterozygotes; on an Aw / at background, these animals exhibited the same abnormal restriction of dorsal pigmentation at P3. 5 and expanded yellow flank area as described above for deH / deH animals ( see Figure 2).

Named for the presence of a DNA - binding domain first identified in the mouse Brachyury gene ( haploinsufficiency causes a short tail), T box - containing genes have been identified as developmental regulators in a wide spectrum of tissues and multicellular organisms ( reviewed in Papaioannou 2001).

These observations suggest that an ancestral gene for Tbx15, Tbx18, and Tbx22 may have been important for craniofacial development in cephalochordates, with acquisition of additional expression patterns and developmental functions in the limb and the trunk during early vertebrate evolution.

In rodents, only the pigmentation boundary is evident externally, but many mammals have more complicated patterns of hair type, length, and / or color that vary along the dorsoventral axis.

Raccoons, squirrels, skunks, and many different ungulates exhibit lateral stripes whose developmental origins have not been investigated, but may correspond to the lateral somitic frontier, the paraspinal Msx1 compartment, or an interaction between these domains.

Saddle markings are common in some dog breeds, such as German shepherds, and in certain populations of Peromyscus polionotus, in which a dorsal extension of ventral depigmentation provides an adaptive advantage to subspecies that live on white sand reefs ( Blair 1951; Kaufman 1974; Belk and Smith 1996).

Neither German shepherds nor deer mice have craniofacial characteristics similar to the deH mutation, but the pigmentation patterns in these animals could represent alterations in the regulation or action of Tbx15 activity.

A similar mouse SLOS model, generated by replacing exons 3, 4 and part of exon 5 of the murine Dhcr7 gene, with similar biochemical and structural defects and a 100% neonatal lethality, has also been reported [ 17].

One explanation of why the Dhcr24 - / - mice are developmentally normal but Dhcr7 - / - mice are affected may be because desmosterol can functionally substitute for cholesterol, whereas the other cholesterol precursors can not.

To determine whether dopamine D2 receptor - mediated signaling contributes to associative and reversal learning, we compared C57Bl / 6J mice that completely lack functional dopamine D2 receptors to wild - type mice with respect to their ability to attach appropriate salience to external stimuli ( stimulus discrimination) and disengage from inappropriate behavioral strategies when reinforcement contingencies change ( e. g. reversal learning).

However, the dopamine D2 receptor deficient mice required significantly more trials than wild - type mice to discriminate between two dishes, each filled with a different scented sand, and to associate one of the two odors with the presence of a reinforcer ( food).

This analysis has determined the phylogenetic relationship of the TACC proteins to other coiled coil proteins, the resolution of the placement of the rabbit TACC4 as the orthologue of human TACC3, and RHAMM as a distinct family of coiled coil proteins.

Thus, during the evolution of vertebrates, subsequent successive duplications of the ancestral gene cluster have given rise to three TACC family members located close to FGFR genes in humans.

Although two additional new candidate TACC family members, Oryctolagus cuniculus TACC4 [ 9] and human RHAMM [ 10] have been proposed, their true identity and placement in the evolution of the TACC family is under debate.

The next major event in the evolution of the chordate genome has been suggested to have occurred 687 +/- 155. 7 million years ago ( MYA), with the first duplication of the chordate genome, and a second duplication occurring shortly thereafter.	"chordate	45	53	Organism"	"chordate	172	180	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""chordate"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""chordate"", ""start_span"": 172, ""end_span"": 180, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, given the intron / exon structure of this apparently complete gene, it appears likely that trTACC1B is active in the pufferfish, and presumably fulfils either a temporal - spatial specific function within the organism, or a distinct function from the larger trTACC1A product within the cell.	"pufferfish	126	136	Organism"	"organism	218	226	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""pufferfish"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""organism"", ""start_span"": 218, ""end_span"": 226, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Thus, based upon the surrounding chromosomal loci ( see below), the trTACC1A and trTACC1B genes appear to have arisen from the duplication of the chromosomal segment containing the teleost TACC1 ancestor, during the additional partial genomic duplication that occurred in the teleost lineage.	"teleost	181	188	Organism"	"teleost	276	283	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""teleost"", ""start_span"": 181, ""end_span"": 188, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""teleost"", ""start_span"": 276, ""end_span"": 283, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This gene is clearly related to the mouse TACC1, however, further examination revealed a mouse B1 repeat distributed over the length of the proposed intron.	"mouse	36	41	Organism"	"mouse	89	94	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We have previously noted that the N - terminal and C - terminal regions of the human and mouse TACC3 proteins are highly conserved ( [ 2], see below).

Therefore, based upon the sequence identity between these genes, we designed a consensus oligonucleotide primer, T3con2, that would be suitable for the identification of the region containing the initiator methionine of the TACC3 cDNAs from primates and rodents.

"Thus, while it remains possible that the "" TACC4 "" sequence is an alternative splice product, or is the product of reduplication of the TACC3 gene ( events that would be specific to the rabbit), the only transcript detected in rabbit RNA corresponds to the predicted transcript size of the TACC3 sequence that we have identified here."

"Because the conservation of gene order can also provide clues to the evolution of gene regulation, we next attempted to trace the evolution of these paralogous segments by examining the genome of the tunicate C. intestinalis [ 11] and the most "" primitive "" compact vertebrate genome sequenced to date, T. rubripes [ 14]."

Similarly, elements of these gene clusters, extending from HMP19 to GPRK6 in human chromosome 5q34 - ter are also found in the pufferfish, with the T. rubripes orthologues of NSD1, FGFR4 and a RAB - like gene mapping on scaffold 407 ( emb | CAAB01000407).

However, it should be noted that no clusters of genes from the vertebrate paralogous segments are locate close to the TACC or RHAMM genes of C. intestinalis, indicating that the formation of the much larger paralogous segments encompassing the FGFR - TACC genes formed later in evolutionary time, or conversely have been subject to extensive rearrangement in tunicates.

In combination with the examination of the T. rubripes genome, this also provides additional evidence that either the second round of duplication of the chromosomal segment that contained the FGFR3 / 4 ancestor did not include a TACC gene, or that such a gene was lost very early in vertebrate evolution, prior to the divergence of the Gnanthostome lineages.

However, the final resolution of the initial evolution of these paralogous segment will await the sequencing of the amphioxus and lamprey genomes, which only have one FGFR gene, and therefore should only contain one copy of the other corresponding genes in this conserved segment.

The lack of conservation in both size and sequence of the central portion of the TACC3 proteins of human and mouse has been previously noted, and accounts for the major difference between these two orthologues [ 2].

The majority of this central portion, which contains the SDP repeat motifs, is encoded by one exon in human and the pufferfish ( emb | CAAB01001184).

Using an in silico protein - protein interaction model based upon known mitotic spindle and centrosomal components, we have previously predicted a number of additional interactions that could be conserved between a functional TACC homologue in yeast, spc - 72, and one or more human TACC proteins [ 21].

For instance, TACC1 and TACC3 interact with Aurora A kinase, whereas TACC2 interacts with Aurora C kinase [ 21], suggesting a degree of functional specialization in the derivatives of the ancestral chordate TACC, after the radiation of the vertebrate TACC genes.

Thus, it seems likely that TACC family members in protostomes and deuterostomes have integrated new unique functions as the evolving TACC genes acquired additional exons.

Similarly, large scale proteomics [ 29] has shown that Drosophila TACC interacts with two proteins, the RNA binding protein TBPH and CG14540 ( Fig. 6B), and thus indirectly with the Drosophila SWI / SNF chromatin remodeling complex and DNA damage repair machinery.

Strikingly, however, the C. elegans specific proteins lin15A, lin36 and lin37 do not have readily discernible homologues in vertebrates or Drosophila, although the presence of a zinc finger domain in lin36 may suggest that this protein is involved directly in transcription or perform an adaptor role similar to LIM containing proteins.

However, the assignment of the human homologue of CG14540 is less clear, with the closest matches in the human databases corresponding to glutamine rich transcription factors such as CREB and the G - box binding factor.

From this analysis, it seems likely that the vertebrate TACC3 protein has retained this direct ancestral function, based upon its location in these structures during mitosis [ 27], its strong interaction with Aurora Kinase A, and the observation that it is the only human TACC protein phosphorylated by this enzyme [ 21].

A recent study has suggested that this function may be unique to maskin: although it is unclear whether the other vertebrate TACC3 proteins interact with the eIF4E / CPEB complex, the human TACC1A isoform is unable to interact with the eIF4E / CPEB complex.

To further characterize the evolving functions of the TACC proteins, we have used an unbiased yeast two hybrid screening method to identify proteins that bind to the human TACC proteins [ 3, 34].

This suggests that while protostome TACCs may require additional protein factors to interact with such components, the TACCs in higher organisms may have evolved the ability to directly interact with some of the proteins in the predicted interaction map ( Fig. 6E).

It is also intriguing that the deuterostome specific SDP repeat interacts with GAS41, a component / accessory factor of the human SWI / SNF chromatin remodeling complex [ 3, 15].

Thus, where the ceTAC protein is only composed of the TACC domain, the significantly larger TACC family members in higher protostomes and deuterostomes may have integrated one or more functions of the bridging protein ( in this case lin15A, lin36 or lin37).

However, over the process of evolutionary time, with the acquisition of new domains and duplication of the chordate TACC precursor, the chordate TACC proteins have acquired the ability to directly interact with some of the other components of these complexes ( such as the LSm proteins, nuclear hormone receptors, GAS41, accessory proteins and transcription factors), and thus evolved additional functions within these complexes.

In a comparison between wild - type and mutant mice found dead on day one of life, body weights were not different; however, the lung weights were significantly lower in the mutant mice.

In nine mice examined at E11. 5, all lungs showed a specific enhancement of Fog2 expression in the mesenchyme surrounding the accessory bud and the right middle lobe bud, which are the lobes that do not develop normally in Fog2 mutant mice ( Figure 5).

Like the human gene, the mouse Atrx gene is also X - linked, such that a direct disruption of the single Atrx allele in male ES cells would immediately give rise to the null state.

It has been shown that disease - causing mutations in the human ATRX gene give rise to changes in the normal pattern of DNA methylation at several repetitive sequences within the human genome [ 11].

Other mouse repetitive sequence elements surveyed in ES cell DNA include the heterochromatic major satellite ( assayed with MaeII) and minor satellite ( assayed with HpaII) repeats, as well as interspersed retroviral repeats of the intracisternal A particle ( IAP) type and the Line 1 and Sine B1 families ( all assayed with HpaII).

Embryonic lethality in mice in the absence of Atrx was a surprising finding, as there had been no suggestion of foetal loss in the human ATR - X syndrome.

It is possible that the role of Atrx in the trophoblast is specific to mice and that ATRX has no role or is redundant in the human trophoblast.

Some full - length ATRX protein is detected in cases predicted to have truncating mutations ( RJG, unpublished data), and residual ATPase activity in ATRX immunoprecipitates can be detected in Epstein - Barr virus - transformed lymphocytes of all human patients analysed to date ( A.

Further evidence that Atrx is also required at later stages of mouse development is provided by the observed dramatic skewing against Atrx - negative cells in some somatic tissues of carrier female mice, whose tissues initially comprise a mosaic of Atrx - positive and Atrx - negative cells as a result of random X - inactivation ( M.

Here we have shown that animal - wide disruption of the Atrx gene causes a severe embryonic - lethal phenotype, revealing an essential role for Atrx in the formation of the murine trophoblast.

An alternate approach to understand the role of Apc in development and / or in specific tissues is to generate a mouse strain that carries a conditionally modified allele and mate it with a mouse strain that facilitates the modification of the conditional allele in specific cell lineages.

Similar to the results reported with an independently generated Apc Delta 580 / + conditional mouse strain [ 14], Apc Delta 580 / + mice had more than 100 ( 120 +/- 37, n = 11) intestinal tumors at the time of their death ( Figure S1).

In addition, this product was not detected at all in either the liver of K14 - cre - positive or in any of the K14 - cre - negative mouse tissues samples, establishing that Cre - mediated recombination has taken place in the tissue - specific manner in the mice that inherited K14 - cre ( Figure 3A).

However, this product was not detected in either the K14 - cre - negative mouse tissues samples or the liver of K14 - cre - positive mice, and only the product from the wild - type allele ( 528 bp) was detected from these RNA samples, further confirming that Cre - mediated recombination has taken place in the tissue - and genotype - specific manner ( Figure 3B).

To gain more insights into the effects of Apc loss in tissues other than gastrointestinal tract during life of animals and to circumvent the embryonic lethality associated with Apc nullizygosity, we created a mouse strain carrying a conditional allele of Apc ( ApcCKO) in which exon 14 of the Apc is flanked by loxP sequences.
