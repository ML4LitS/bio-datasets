For butyric acid degradation, since no genome - scale model of known butyric acid - oxidizing bacteria is available yet, we augmented model iSfu648 by the reactions catalyzed by the butyryl - CoA synthetase and the acetyl - CoA acetyltransferase, added butyric acid uptake via a proton symport, and enforced the excretion of 97. 9% of the carbon influx as acetic acid, using the same ratio that the model predicted for growth on propionic acid.

Forty - nine SD rats were grouped into seven groups comprising a reference group ( n = 7) fed a regular ( low - fat) chow, a group of AIA rats treated with vehicle ( n = 7), a group of AIA rats gavaged with L. casei ( n = 7), a group of AIA rats gavaged with MTX ( n = 7), a group of AIA rats gavaged with GJK ( n = 7) or ZQFNT ( n = 7), and a group of AIA rats fed a high - fat diet ( D12492) ( n = 7).
