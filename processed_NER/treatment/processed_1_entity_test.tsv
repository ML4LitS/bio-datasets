Since this patient population is a major reservoir of MDRO, investigating their fecal resistomes to characterize and quantify fecal antimicrobial - resistance ( AR) genes is needed ( van Schaik, 2015).

Most animals consumed the entire daily volume of DSSwater for the treatment duration, however, some animals failed to ingest the prescribed dose and some animals consumed each dose more rapidly than others, which may be reflected in some of the animal - to - animal variability seen in our measures of colitis.
