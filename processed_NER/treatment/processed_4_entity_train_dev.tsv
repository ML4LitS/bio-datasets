Owing to the severity of colitis in animals treated with 1% DSS for 5 days, we then tested 0. 25% DSS for 7 days and then for 10 days, which yielded optimal mild - to - moderate colitis with few overt clinical symptoms, and thus this dose ( 4 - to 20 - fold less DSS than in most murine DSS models published) and duration were chosen for subsequent experiments.
