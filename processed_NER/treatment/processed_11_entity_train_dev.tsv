Growth with CO and different CO - rich gas mixtures by pure and mixed cultures 1mL of a CO - consuming culture ( mixed or pure isolate) in exponential growth was used to inoculate glass serum bottles ( 160mL) with 50mL reduced anaerobic medium and different substrates: CO, CO: CO2, CO: H2, CO: CO2: H2, or CO: yeast extract ( YE).
