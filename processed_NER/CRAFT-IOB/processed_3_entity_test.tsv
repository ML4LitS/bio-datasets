These results indicated that both alphaA - and alphaB - crystallin are necessary for proper fiber cell formation, and that the absence of alpha - crystallin can lead to cataract formation.

During the early 1990 ' s, alpha - crystallin was shown to act as a molecular chaperone, binding to partially denatured proteins, both in vitro [ 5] and probably in vivo [ 6], to inhibit further denaturation and aggregation of lens proteins.

In addition to the equatorial region, ultrastructural differences between alphaA / BKO lenses ( Figure 3C and 3H) and wild type lenses ( Figure 3M and 3R) were observed in fiber cells of the embryonic and fetal nucleus.

Although this property may be a major contributor to the maintenance of lens clarity, the early changes in the alphaA / BKO lenses indicate a much broader cellular function for alpha - crystallin.

It is therefore possible that increased synthesis of alpha - crystallin in epithelial cells early in the differentiation process may have profound effects upon the cytoskeleton, which in turn may profoundly affect cell shape and migration.

This group of cells continues to express tif1 gamma and scl while it converges and forms the embryonic blood island ( Detrich et al. 1995).

Taken together these results strongly suggest that zebrafish mon and mouse Tif1 gamma are orthologs that function during hematopoiesis.

Like mammalian TIF1 alpha ( Le Douarin et al. 1995; Niederreither et al. 1999), the predicted zebrafish tif1 gamma gene is broadly expressed ( see Figure 4A).

Therefore, tif1 alpha is coexpressed in the same cells with tif1 gamma and may therefore be available to form hetero - oligomers in vivo.

Consistent with this finding, after 24 hpf, zebrafish mon mRNA expression falls during the terminal maturation of the primitive erythroid cells ( unpublished data).

Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterised by the production of autoantibodies ( auto - Abs) against a wide spectrum of self - antigens, mainly from subcellular compartments, especially the cell nucleus.

Amongst these shared susceptibility loci, the most striking are loci on distal Chromosome 1, for which important contributing genes have been found in New Zealand and BXSB models ( Theofilopoulos and Kono 1999; Wakeland et al. 2001).

Thus, targeted genetic disruption of candidate genes encoding proteins of the immune system has been extensively used to examine their role in immune regulation.

In this regard, it is of note that hybrid strains between 129 and C57BL / 6 mice, widely used in the generation of gene - targeted mice, are spontaneously predisposed to development of humoral autoimmunity with low levels of glomerulonephritis ( Obata et al. 1979; Botto et al. 1998; Bickerstaff et al. 1999; Santiago - Raber et al. 2001).	"mice	76	80	Organism"	"gene	101	105	Sequence"	"mice	131	135	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""gene"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Furthermore, the genetic background markedly influences the autoimmune phenotype in gene - targeted mice ( Bolland and Ravetch 2000; Santiago - Raber et al. 2001; Mitchell et al. 2002).	"genetic	17	24	Sequence"	"gene	84	88	Sequence"	"mice	100	104	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""genetic"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""gene"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Here we show that there are multiple genetic loci, derived from both 129 and C57BL / 6 mice, contributing to autoimmunity.	"genetic	37	44	Sequence"	"loci	45	49	Sequence"	"mice	87	91	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""genetic"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""loci"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
As previously reported ( Botto et al. 1998), the wild - type ( 129 x C57BL / 6) F2 mice developed lupus traits with elevated levels of auto - Abs, starting from 6 mo of age ( data not shown), and histological evidence of proliferative glomerulonephritis.

Consistent with this explanation, we found that the 129 mice have significantly higher levels of Apcs in circulation compared with the C57BL / 6 mice ( median, 83 mg / l; range, 25 - 208; n = 16 versus median, 5 mg / l; range, 4 - 9; n = 10, respectively; p < 0. 0001).

A genomic region between D3Mit40 and D3Mit13, with an estimated peak at position approximately 51 cM, showed a significant linkage to ANA production and weaker linkages to anti - ssDNA and anti - chromatin production ( see Table 3; Figure 7).	"genomic region	2	16	Sequence"	"position	72	80	Sequence"	"chromatin	196	205	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""genomic region"", ""start_span"": 2, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""position"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""chromatin"", ""start_span"": 196, ""end_span"": 205, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
We investigated further the effects of genes from the C57BL / 6 background by repeating the linkage analysis in ( 129 x C57BL / 6) F2 mice, whilst controlling for the very strong 129 effect on distal Chromosome 1, as previously described ( Zeng 1994).	"genes	39	44	Sequence"	"mice	134	138	Organism"	"Chromosome	200	210	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Chromosome"", ""start_span"": 200, ""end_span"": 210, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
We generated a C57BL / 6 congenic line carrying the telomeric region of Chromosome 1 from the 129 mouse strain, in order to dissect the complex polygenic disease phenotype of the ( C57BL / 6 x 129 / Sv) F2 hybrid strain into its individual genetic components.	"telomeric region of Chromosome	52	82	GO_ontology"	"mouse	98	103	Organism"	"genetic	240	247	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""telomeric region of Chromosome"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""genetic"", ""start_span"": 240, ""end_span"": 247, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Each backcrossed generation was screened with more than three markers per chromosome to facilitate the removal of unselected 129 genomic regions.	"chromosome	74	84	GO_ontology"	"removal	103	110	Sequence"	"genomic regions	129	144	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""chromosome"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""removal"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""genomic regions"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Thus, the congenic line carried a similar 129 region ( 80 - 106 cM) to the one present in the C57BL / 6. Apcs - / - mice ( 87. 9 - 105 cM).	"region	46	52	Sequence"	"Apcs	105	109	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	116	120	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""region"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Apcs"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
As previously reported ( Bickerstaff et al. 1999), the levels of auto - Abs were markedly increased in the C57BL / 6. Apcs - / - compared to the wild - type C57BL / 6 controls.	"Abs	72	75	GO_ontology"	"Apcs	118	122	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"wild - type	145	156	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Abs"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""Apcs"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""wild - type"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
These results clearly demonstrated that epistatic interactions between 129 loci on Chromosome 1 and C57BL / 6 genes were sufficient to mediate the loss of tolerance to nuclear autoantigens.	"loci on Chromosome	75	93	Sequence"	"genes	110	115	Sequence"	"nuclear	168	175	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""loci on Chromosome"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 168, ""end_span"": 175, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
However, in contrast to the serological data, the histological assessment of the kidneys showed evidence of markedly increased glomerulonephritis in the C57BL / 6. Apcs - / - compared to both control groups ( Figure 9), suggesting that the lack of Apcs, when combined with other C57BL / 6 susceptibility alleles, can induce the development of severe renal damage.

There is accumulating evidence that background genes may influence the expression of autoimmunity in gene - targeted mice.

The influence of background genes on the development of spontaneous autoimmune disease is well known, especially with respect to the lpr and Yaa disease - susceptibility genes.	"genes	28	33	Sequence"	"Yaa	141	144	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"genes	170	175	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Yaa"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 170, ""end_span"": 175, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
In MRL / Mp mice, the presence of the lpr gene accelerates the development of high level and broad - spectrum auto - Ab production and lethal glomerulonephritis, in addition to marked lymphoproliferative disease.	"mice	12	16	Organism"	"gene	42	46	Sequence"	"Ab	117	119	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""gene"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Ab"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Not surprisingly, important effects of the genetic background on the expression of autoimmunity have also been reported in gene - targeted mice ( Bolland and Ravetch 2000; Santiago - Raber et al. 2001; Mitchell et al. 2002).	"genetic	43	50	Sequence"	"gene	123	127	Sequence"	"mice	139	143	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""genetic"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""gene"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Through the use of microsatellite marker maps, the identification of murine SLE susceptibility intervals in experimental crosses has been made possible.	"microsatellite marker	19	40	Sequence"	"murine	69	75	Organism"	"intervals	95	104	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""microsatellite marker"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""murine"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""intervals"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
These mapping studies have shown that the disease expression in relation to the inheritance of the different alleles followed a threshold liability pattern in which a positive phenotype depended upon the presence of multiple discrete susceptibility loci with no single locus being a prerequisite factor.	"alleles	109	116	Sequence"	"loci	249	253	Sequence"	"locus	269	274	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""alleles"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""loci"", ""start_span"": 249, ""end_span"": 253, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""locus"", ""start_span"": 269, ""end_span"": 274, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
We showed that there are multiple genetic loci contributing to the disease and these are derived from both 129 and C57BL / 6 mice.	"genetic	34	41	Sequence"	"loci	42	46	Sequence"	"mice	125	129	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""genetic"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""loci"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This region is probably capable of causing the initiation of a humoral autoimmune response to nuclear antigens; however, this response does not occur in the absence of C57BL / 6 genes.

In support of this, we identified a C57BL / 6 segment on Chromosome 3, which may interact with the 129 genes on Chromosome 1 to mediate the loss of tolerance.	"segment on Chromosome	46	67	Sequence"	"genes	103	108	Sequence"	"Chromosome	112	122	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""segment on Chromosome"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Chromosome"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Furthermore, the region on Chromosome 7 associated with the development of lupus nephritis has been linked to the same trait in other murine models of SLE ( Santiago et al. 1998; Morel et al. 1999; Xie et al. 2002), suggesting the possibility of shared susceptibility loci.	"region on Chromosome	17	37	Sequence"	"murine	134	140	Organism"	"loci	268	272	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""region on Chromosome"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""murine"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""loci"", ""start_span"": 268, ""end_span"": 272, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
We have previously reported that ( 129 x C57BL / 6). Apcs - / - mice spontaneously produce a wide range of ANAs and develop significant immune complex glomerulonephritis ( Bickerstaff et al. 1999).	"Apcs	53	57	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	64	68	Organism"	"immune complex	136	150	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Apcs"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""immune complex"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
A possible explanation for this discrepancy may lie in the fact that the Apcs - / - mice analysed in the original study were generated from a limited number of founders and that this may have caused a nonrandom inheritance of the loci from the parental strains.	"Apcs	73	77	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	84	88	Organism"	"loci	230	234	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Apcs"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""loci"", ""start_span"": 230, ""end_span"": 234, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
We adopted the same strategy to investigate the relative contribution of the 129 Chromosome 1 segment and the Apcs gene to each disease trait.	"Chromosome 1 segment	81	101	Sequence"	"Apcs	110	114	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"gene	115	119	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Chromosome 1 segment"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Apcs"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""gene"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
The expression of anti - nuclear autoimmunity was identical comparing the congenic with the Apcs - / - mice.	"nuclear	25	32	GO_ontology"	"Apcs	92	96	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	103	107	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""Apcs"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Consistent with this, a polymorphism associated with reduced basal level of C - reactive protein has been reported to be linked to SLE in humans ( Russell et al. 2004).	"polymorphism	24	36	Sequence"	"C - reactive protein	76	96	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"humans	138	144	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""polymorphism"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""C - reactive protein"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""humans"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Thus, whilst the lack of lupus nephritis in the congenic mice is consistent with the need for multiple susceptibility genes for the full expression of lupus, further studies will be required to fully elucidate the role of Apcs in the pathogenesis of renal damage.

In summary, our findings demonstrate the impact of epistatic interactions between 129 and C57BL / 6 genomes on the development of SLE and illustrate how these background gene effects may lead to incorrect interpretations when analysing the autoimmune phenotype of specific genetic disruptions.

Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells is very distinct from other engulfment processes that result, for example, in the clearance of microorganisms, because engulfment of apoptotic cells triggers the secretion of potent anti - inflammatory and immunosuppressive mediators, whereas pathogen recognition causes the release of pro - inflammatory signals [ 6].

Consistent with the observations of Kunisaki and colleagues [ 32], we found severely blocked erythropoietic differentiation at an early erythroblast stage in the liver ( Figure 3f, 3l), suggesting an explanation for the grossly anemic appearance that we observed in our Ptdsr - / - mice.

At day E16. 5, however, retinal layers in Ptdsr - / - embryos were much thinner than in wild - type embryos, contained fewer cells and were greatly reduced in size ( Figure 4b, f).

Apoptosis of interdigital cells in the distal mesenchyme of limb buds occurs most prominently from developmental stages E12. 0 to E13. 5 and can be easily examined in situ by whole - mount terminal deoxynucleotide transferase - mediated UTP end - labeling ( TUNEL).

This suggests that at this stage of development it is mainly neighboring cells that are involved in removal of apoptotic cells, rather than professional macrophages.

This indicates that ablation of Ptdsr function does not compromise in general the ability of macrophages to release immune - suppressive cytokines after recognition and engulfment of apoptotic cells.

Other defects must therefore be responsible for the death of Ptdsr - mutant mice.

[ 31] found smaller lenses in Ptdsr - knockout mice and described the formation of retinal protrusions, although anophthalmia and specific differentiation defects of retinal cell layers were not reported in their study.

Furthermore, cell death during normal retinal development occurs in retinal layers distinct from the inner granular layer where we observed the most pronounced differentiation defects in the Ptdsr - / - mutants described here.	"cell	13	17	Cell"	"Ptdsr	191	196	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutants	203	210	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 191, ""end_span"": 196, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutants"", ""start_span"": 203, ""end_span"": 210, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
In summary, our studies demonstrate that Ptdsr is required for normal tissue differentiation, especially during the mid - gestation period when we observed the most severe differentiation delays in several organs of Ptdsr - knockout mice.	"Ptdsr	41	46	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Ptdsr	216	221	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	233	237	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 216, ""end_span"": 221, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 233, ""end_span"": 237, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Additional studies with conditionally targeted Ptdsr - deficient mice are required to investigate the role of spatial and temporal Ptdsr expression and function during tissue differentiation.	"Ptdsr	47	52	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	65	69	Organism"	"Ptdsr	131	136	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In addition, our data suggest that during embryogenesis, macrophage - mediated clearance of apoptotic cells is not the only - or even the primary - mechanism for the removal of apoptotic cells.	"macrophage	57	67	Cell"	"apoptotic cells	92	107	Cell"	"apoptotic cells	177	192	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""macrophage"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 192, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In many tissues where programmed cell death occurs as a prominent event during embryogenesis, such as remodeling of the genital ridge during gonad morphogenesis and differentiation of the neural tube, we found almost no co - localization of apoptotic cells and macrophages.	"cell	33	37	Cell"	"apoptotic cells	241	256	Cell"	"macrophages	261	272	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 241, ""end_span"": 256, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 261, ""end_span"": 272, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This indicates that in these cases clearance of apoptotic cells is directly mediated by neighboring ' bystander ' cells rather than by macrophages that have been recruited into areas where apoptosis occurs.	"apoptotic cells	48	63	Cell"	"cells	114	119	Cell"	"macrophages	135	146	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
[ 31], we did not observe any impairment in the uptake of apoptotic cells by Ptdsr - / - macrophages in vitro.

Thus, it seems possible that recruitment and activation / differentiation of macrophages after adoptive transfer and thioglycollate elicitation are affected by Ptdsr - deficiency.

This is especially important in light of recent findings that demonstrated nuclear localization of the Ptdsr protein [ 29].

The developmental malformations cannot be explained by impaired clearance of apoptotic cells, a process that proved to be normal in Ptdsr - deficient mice.

Interestingly, HPLAP expression in the Gdf5 - Cre transgenic GAC ( A) line used for all subsequent breeding experiments was seen to precede LACZ expression during successive development of joints in the digits ( Figure 1C) ( unpublished data).

These experiments clearly demonstrate that the Gdf5 - Cre transgene expresses Cre recombinase and causes DNA recombination in developing joint regions.

Adult expression patterns of the Gdf5 gene are not as well characterized, but Gdf5 expression has previously been detected in adult articular cartilage using both RT - PCR and immunocytochemistry ( Chang et al. 1994; Erlacher et al. 1998; Bobacz et al. 2002).

"Surprisingly, 23 of 63, or 37% of transgenic mice analyzed also show some degree of wider "" ectopic "" LACZ expression, which can extend throughout many different tissues in the animal."

However, sustained expression of the transgene itself, as assayed by HPLAP activity, is still restricted primarily to joints in animals that show evidence of more generalized recombination based on LACZ expression ( unpublished data).

Most cells found in the webbed region between the first and second digits at E15. 5 strongly expressed LACZ in Gdf5 - Cre / Bmpr1afloxP mutant embryos ( Figure 2H).	"cells	5	10	Cell"	"Gdf5	111	115	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutant	136	142	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Gdf5"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Although Gdf5 - Cre - mediated recombination was seen as early as E13. 5 in digit interzone regions ( see Figure 2C), no changes in cell death or cell proliferation could be seen in the metacarpal - phalangeal or metatarsal - phalangeal joints at E13. 5 or E14. 5 ( unpublished data).	"Gdf5	9	13	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cell	132	136	Cell"	"cell	146	150	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Gdf5"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Similarly, although clear LACZ expression was seen by E15. 5 in interphalangeal joints and periarticular regions ( Figure 4D), no difference in morphology or expression of Col2a1, Gdf5, or Bmpr1b was seen in the articular regions of the phalanges at these stages ( unpublished data).

In both control and mutant animals, transcription of Mat4 was clearly detectable in the articular cartilage layers of newborn joints ( Figure 5D and 5I).

For example, Osteocalcin and Col1a1 expression appeared normal in osteoblasts ( unpublished data).

Together, these data suggest that BMPR1A activity is required in postnatal joint articular cartilage to maintain expression of many genes encoding structural components of cartilage matrix.

No alterations were seen in the expression of Osteocalcin, Col1a1, or matrix metalloprotease - 13 at either 7 wk or 9 mo.

The Gdf5 - Cre recombination system bypasses the early embryonic lethality of Bmpr1a mutations, and provides important new information about the role of this receptor in limb and skeletal development.

The three major limb phenotypes revealed by eliminating Bmpr1a with Gdf5 - driven Cre include webbing between digits, lack of joint formation at specific locations in the ankle, and failure to maintain articular cartilage after birth, resulting in severe arthritis.	"eliminating	44	55	Sequence"	"Bmpr1a	56	62	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Gdf5	68	72	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""eliminating"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Bmpr1a"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Gdf5"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Despite the normal appearance of articular regions and gene expression immediately after birth, Bmpr1a - deficient animals are unable to maintain the normal differentiated state of articular cartilage as they continue to develop and age.

It is interesting that the SOX9 transcription factor continues to be expressed in mutant cartilage despite loss of Col2a1, a direct target of this transcription factor ( Bell et al. 1997; Lefebvre et al. 1997).	"SOX9 transcription factor	27	52	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutant	82	88	Sequence"	"Col2a1	115	121	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""SOX9 transcription factor"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Col2a1"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
These models are consistent with the ability of BMP2 to both increase PKA activity and induce expression of Sox6 in tissue culture cells ( Lee and Chuong 1997; Fernandez - Lloris et al. 2003).	"BMP2	48	52	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Sox6	108	112	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cells	131	136	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Sox6"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Furthermore, null mutations in L - Sox5 or Sox - 6 cause lethality at or soon after birth, and no effect on cartilage maintenance has been reported ( Smits et al. 2001).	"mutations	18	27	Sequence"	"L - Sox5	31	39	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Sox - 6	43	50	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""mutations"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""L - Sox5"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Sox - 6"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, it seems likely that these or other processes regulated by BMP signaling cooperate with SOX9 to induce target genes in articular cartilage.

In contrast, our analysis of Bmpr1a mutant articular cartilage showed a loss of ECM components, but no signs of hypertrophy or bone replacement.

The failure to maintain articular cartilage in the absence of normal BMPR1A function suggests that ligands or small molecule agonists that interact specifically with this receptor subtype may be particularly good candidates for designing new approaches to maintain or heal articular cartilage at postnatal stages.

However, the control mice used in this study were heterozygous for a null allele of Bmpr1a, and they showed little sign of osteoarthritis even late in life.

The Gdf5 - Cre system provides a new method for restricting gene expression or inactivation primarily to articular regions, thus avoiding the pleiotropic functions of many genes in other tissues.

Depending on the configuration of the floxed target gene, this system can be used to either activate the expression of a gene primarily in developing joints ( ssee Figure 1B - 1D), or to inactivate gene function in articular regions ( see Figure 3).

DRG axons began extending towards the localized NT - 3 source by the end of the first day and consistently displayed a strong chemoattraction by 3 d in vitro, whereas they did not show such preference for BSA - loaded control beads ( Figure 5A and 5B).

Conversely, beads soaked with neurotrophin function - blocking antibodies led to reduction of sensory and motor axon growth towards the limb.

However, earlier findings of normal proprioceptive afferent trajectories in chicken embryos despite injection of function - blocking NT - 3 antibody into the spinal cord ( Oakley et al. 1995) led them to discount this possibility.

( 1997) argue that while central sensory axons may still navigate properly in the absence of NT - 3, ectopic expression of NT - 3 disrupts their targeting.

Seventy - three percent of retrogradely labeled gastrocnemius muscle afferents were reported to be expressing TrkC RNA in the adult rat DRG, although some of these ( about 10%) may represent cutaneous innervation ( McMahon et al. 1994).

On Bub - T40 and Bub - T50, on the other hand, significant displacement was observed, indicating that a single - stranded segment of at least 40 nt long is required for efficient helicase actions on bubble substrates ( Figure 2B).

In contrast, PriA helicase, used as a control, bound to A - fork [ 3 '] more efficiently than to A - fork [ 5 '], as reported previously ( 23, 25).

Mcm4 / 6 / 7 bound to A - fork [ 3 ', 5 '] with much lower affinity, and the complex gave rise to a single band.

This is consistent with the previous results that Mcm4 / 6 / 7 binds to 50mer oligo - dT, - dC and - dG, but not to a 50mer oligo - dA ( 13).

Therefore, the elucidation of how the replicative helicases interact with DNA substrate and how they are activated is crucial for understanding the molecular basis of initiation of DNA replication.

Helicases are loaded onto replication forks through the melted region, induced by initiator binding, in bacteria ( 32).

We previously reported that Mcm4 / 6 / 7 can be loaded onto a bubble - like structure and can serve as a DNA helicase at the forks ( 13).

This is most clearly shown by its helicase action on A - fork [ 5 '] and 3 ' - extension but not on A - fork [ 3 '], A - fork [ 3 ', 5 '] nor 5 ' - extension.

We also noticed that the presence of a secondary structure within the single - stranded DNA is inhibitory for helicase action.

However, on this substrate, Mcm4 / 6 / 7 was able to displace DNA past the GC - rich region, albeit to a limited extent, when it was added at a high concentration.

Inactivation of the Huntington ' s disease gene ( Hdh) impairs anterior streak formation and early patterning of the mouse embryo	"Huntington ' s disease gene	20	47	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Hdh	50	53	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mouse	117	122	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Huntington ' s disease gene"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Hdh"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These findings provide fundamental starting points for identifying the novel cellular and molecular activities of huntingtin in the extraembryonic tissues that govern normal anterior streak development.

However, polyglutamine expansions in unrelated proteins that target distinct neuronal cell populations cause distinct ' polyglutamine ' neurodegenerative disorders.

This observation strongly suggests that the striatal cell specificity of the polyglutamine expansion in the context of huntingtin must be determined by some aspect of huntingtin ' s structure, subcellular location or activities [ 2].	"cell	53	57	Cell"	"huntingtin	119	129	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"huntingtin	167	177	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""huntingtin"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""huntingtin"", ""start_span"": 167, ""end_span"": 177, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Huntingtin is postulated to function as a flexible ~ 350 kDa HEAT domain scaffold that may facilitate the assembly and possibly the subcellular location of large protein complexes [ 3 - 7].	"Huntingtin	0	10	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"domain	66	72	Sequence"	"protein complexes	162	179	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Huntingtin"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""domain"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""protein complexes"", ""start_span"": 162, ""end_span"": 179, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Therefore, we, and others, set out to discover huntingtin ' s essential activities by studying the effects of huntingtin deficiency in the mouse.	"huntingtin	47	57	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"huntingtin	110	120	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mouse	139	144	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""huntingtin"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""huntingtin"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, huntingtin is needed at the level of the organism for proper mammalian embryonic development [ 10, 13, 14].	"huntingtin	9	19	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"organism	50	58	Organism"	"mammalian	70	79	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""huntingtin"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""organism"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mammalian"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
To investigate huntingtin ' s developmental activities, we then analyzed the expression of genes which pattern the early embryo or mark morphogenic landmarks in wild - type and Hdhex4 / 5 / Hdhex4 / 5 embryos by whole mount and section in situ hybridization.	"huntingtin	15	25	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"genes	91	96	Sequence"	"wild - type	161	172	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""huntingtin"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""wild - type"", ""start_span"": 161, ""end_span"": 172, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Extraembryonic mesoderm, derived from the proximal streak, does not normally express T or Evx1 in wild - type embryos [ 22].	"T	85	86	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Evx1	90	94	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"wild - type	98	109	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""T"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Evx1"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""wild - type"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Therefore, the inappropriate expression of T and Evx1, the shortened primitive streak, and the absence of a morphological node, all suggest that the anterior primitive streak is deficient in the mutant embryos.	"T	0	1	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Evx1	49	53	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutant	195	201	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""T"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 1, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Evx1"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 195, ""end_span"": 201, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
However, in mutant embryos, both T ( B, D) and Evx1 ( F) are ectopically expressed in the extraembryonic region.

Wnt3A expression is reduced in mutant embryos ( H), although the localization of its expression to the proximal streak is the same as in wild - type embryos ( G).

In huntingtin deficient mutants, Wnt3a is induced in the proximal streak ( Fig. 2G, H), confirming stage appropriate posterior development, in contrast to the absence of anterior head folds.

Furthermore, in mutant embryos at E7. 5, the expression of Dll1 in the distal streak region and in only a narrow swath of cells located laterally confirms the paucity of paraxial mesoderm ( Fig. 2K, L, [ 24]).

Nodal, a member of the Tgf beta family of secreted molecules is required for the formation and maintenance of the primitive streak and induction of the AVE [ 25 - 27].

Nodal expression was assessed in Hdhex4 / 5 / Hdhex4 / 5 embryos heterozygous for the Ndl lac Z allele [ 28, 29].

The tight node expression of Nodal in normal embryos ( C) is lost in mutant embryos ( D), consistent with the loss of a morphological node in the absence of huntingtin.

Transient expression of Gsc in the definitive endoderm overlying the prospective head region in normal embryos ( I, K) is distinguished in other cell layers in normal embryos but remains unrestricted in mutant embryos ( J, L).

However, streak derivatives appear to migrate normally as evidenced by the proper anterior expression of markers such as Otx2, Hnf3 beta and Hesx1 anteriorly ( Fig. 1).	"Otx2	121	125	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Hnf3 beta	127	136	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Hesx1	141	146	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Otx2"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Hnf3 beta"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Hesx1"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Therefore, mutant embryos exhibit normal migration of streak derivatives but display impaired Fgf8 repression in mutant endoderm.

However, in the mutant Hdhex4 / 5 / Hdhex4 / 5 embryos, high levels of Gsc expression remain unrestricted in the endoderm overlying the entire embryo and ectopically in cells adjacent to the ectoplacental cone ( Fig. 3J, L).	"mutant	16	22	Sequence"	"Gsc	71	74	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cells	169	174	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Gsc"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In Hdhex4 / 5 / Hdhex4 / 5 embryos, consistent with normal primitive and visceral endoderm differentiation, Hnf4 expression appears normal, although the signal is stronger in mutant embryos compared to wild - type embryos ( Fig. 4B).	"Hnf4	108	112	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutant	175	181	Sequence"	"wild - type	202	213	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Hnf4"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 181, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""wild - type"", ""start_span"": 202, ""end_span"": 213, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Similarly, Pem, a transcription factor expressed in proximal visceral endoderm and ectoplacental cone in wild - type embryos at E7. 5, also is expressed in these tissues in the mutant embryos ( Fig. 4C, D [ 35]).	"Pem	11	14	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"wild - type	105	116	Sequence"	"mutant	177	183	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Pem"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""wild - type"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 183, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Lefty1 expression appears disorganized in mutant embryos ( I) compared to wild - type embryos ( J).

In contrast, the anterior expression of Dkk1 in the AVE in mutant embryos ( L) matches the wild - type expression pattern ( K).	"Dkk1	40	44	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutant	59	65	Sequence"	"wild - type	91	102	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Dkk1"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""wild - type"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
In Hdhex4 / 5 / Hdhex4 / 5 embryos, both Dkk1 ( Fig. 4I, J) and Lefty1 ( Fig. 4K, L) are expressed normally in the AVE as compared with wild - type embryos.	"Dkk1	41	45	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Lefty1	64	70	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"wild - type	136	147	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Dkk1"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Lefty1"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""wild - type"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 147, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Instead, our results reveal that huntingtin is required for normal anterior streak formation and the consequent production of paraxial mesoderm, with a previously unrecognized role for huntingtin in the proper extinction of transiently and / or dynamically expressed genes.	"huntingtin	33	43	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"huntingtin	185	195	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"genes	267	272	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""huntingtin"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""huntingtin"", ""start_span"": 185, ""end_span"": 195, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 267, ""end_span"": 272, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Indeed, the hallmark of the huntingtin deficient molecular phenotype is the impaired down - regulation of a subset of dynamically expressed genes, after the proper onset of expression.	"huntingtin	28	38	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"molecular	49	58	Chemical"	"genes	140	145	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""huntingtin"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""molecular"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Nor can it be simply explained by delayed development, as stage - specific markers, such as Wnt3a and primordial germ cells, which are detectable at E7. 0 in wild - type embryos, are induced appropriately.	"Wnt3a	92	97	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"primordial germ cells	102	123	Cell"	"wild - type	158	169	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Wnt3a"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""primordial germ cells"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""wild - type"", ""start_span"": 158, ""end_span"": 169, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
However, Nodal, Fgf8 and Gsc are expressed ectopically in the visceral endoderm of Hdhex4 / 5 / Hdhex4 / 5 embryos.	"Nodal	9	14	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Fgf8	16	20	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Gsc	25	28	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Nodal"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Fgf8"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Gsc"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In addition, it is possible that other extraembryonic signal ( s) that we have not analyzed may also be affected by the lack of huntingtin activity in extraembryonic cells in mutant embryos.

The presence of some mature glycosylated proteins ( 35 - 45 kDa) in Aqp2F204V / F204V mice presumably permits their survival compared to Aqp2T126M / T126M mice, and is consistent with a diminished response to dDAVP.

To allow for the mechanistic separation of olfactory learning, discrimination, and memory, we exploited a well - known phenomenon of transgenes, which concerns heterogeneous expression among different founder lines and even among genetically identical individuals of a given line.

Motor coordination measured in an accelerating rotarod was somewhat impaired in the mutant mice ( wild - type: 156 s +/- 37, n = 6; GluR - B Delta FB: 37 s +/- 10, n = 6; p < 0. 05).

As activity, measured by the intertrial interval, was not significantly different between genotypes ( F ( 1, 16) = 3. 1; p = 0. 1), and analysis of the lick frequency showed a tendency to reduced motivation of GluR - B Delta FB mice in this particular task ( F ( 1, 16) = 9. 2; p < 0. 01), we conclude that depletion of GluR - B in forebrain areas indeed resulted in increased olfactory learning and discrimination performances, rather than motivational alterations.

Olfactory Memory Correlates with Residual GluR - B Protein Expression in GluR - B Delta FB Mice	"GluR - B	42	50	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Protein	51	58	Chemical"	"Mice	91	95	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Protein"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""Mice"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Whereas no learning or discrimination - related parameter correlated with residual protein levels ( Figure 4D, R2 < 0. 3), a strong correlation between memory and GluR - B protein was observed in hippocampus ( Figure 4D, R2 = 0. 72, p < 0. 003, n = 10) and cortical areas ( Figure 4D, R2 = 0. 62, p < 0. 006, n = 10).

GluR - A levels were unchanged from wild - type, indicating that compensatory up - regulation of other AMPAR subunits is unlikely ( GluR - A levels relative to control: 1. 02 +/- 0. 05, mean +/- SEM, n = 10).

In summary, mice with reduced GluR - B levels in forebrain areas showed decreased olfactory memory, which correlated tightly with a reduction in GluR - B levels in the hippocampus and cortical areas.

Partial Rescue of Olfactory Memory Deficit by Selective Transgenic GluR - B Expression in Hippocampus and Piriform Cortex in GluR - B Delta FB Mice	"Transgenic	56	66	Sequence"	"GluR - B	67	75	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Mice	143	147	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Transgenic"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Mice"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 147, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The effect of selective GluR - B depletion in mice indicated that GluR - B - containing AMPARs in the hippocampus, and / or ( olfactory) cortex are likely to be important for olfactory memory.

Notably, the partial memory is in numerical agreement with the predictions from the protein correlation and the measurement of transgenic protein expression ( see predicted memory, blue line, in Figure 6B).	"protein	84	91	Chemical"	"transgenic	127	137	Sequence"	"protein	138	145	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""transgenic"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
In the olfactory memory experiments with GluR - B Delta FB animals, olfactory memory linearly depended on GluR - B expression in cortex and hippocampus with a slope of 9. 1 +/- 2. 5% ( cortex) and 8. 9 +/- 2. 0% ( hippocampus) increase in memory per 10% increase in protein ( Figure 4D).	"animals	59	66	Organism"	"GluR - B	106	114	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"protein	266	273	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 266, ""end_span"": 273, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
However, odor discrimination ( measured by the discrimination index as in Figures 1, 2, and 4D) was as enhanced as in GluR - B Delta FB mice ( 0. 79 +/- 0. 05, mean +/- SEM compared with 0. 76 +/- 0. 02, p > 0. 7, Figure 6C), and improved relative to GluR - B2lox controls ( 0. 48 +/- 0. 06; Figure 6C; overall ANOVA: F ( 2, 41) = 17. 2, p < 10 - 5; post hoc Newman Keuls: p < 10 - 3), as expected if the enhanced discrimination phenotype is due to Ca2 + - permeable AMPARs in the olfactory bulb and unaffected by GluR - B expression in piriform cortex or hippocampus.	"mice	136	140	Organism"	"Ca2 +	449	454	Chemical"	"GluR - B	514	522	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Ca2 +"", ""start_span"": 449, ""end_span"": 454, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 514, ""end_span"": 522, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Hence, transgenic GluR - B expression, specifically in the piriform cortex and hippocampus in the GluR - B knockout background, rescues the odor memory deficit but leaves enhanced olfactory discrimination and learning unaltered.

The subsequent transgene - driven re - introduction of GluR - B, specifically in piriform cortex and hippocampus, reversed the Cre - induced loss of GluR - B and partially rescued the odor memory deficit, but left unaltered the enhanced olfactory discrimination.

In a nutshell, we conclude that olfactory discrimination is enhanced by an increase in AMPAR - mediated Ca2 + permeability within the olfactory bulb, whereas olfactory memory becomes impaired upon genetically induced GluR - B ablation in higher brain centers, specifically in piriform cortex.

Both forebrain - specific GluR - B ( Q) expression and GluR - B depletion led to increased olfactory learning and discrimination capabilities.

As no Cre expression and activity was observed in the main olfactory sensory neurons at any developmental stage ( Figure S4 and unpublished data), olfactory epithelial function was unaltered by the genetic modification.

"Interestingly, transgenic expression of GFPGluR - B in GluR - B Delta FB mice ( genetic "" rescue ""), specifically in piriform cortex and hippocampus with no detectable expression in the olfactory bulb, did not alter enhanced discrimination and learning capabilities."

AMPAR currents are reduced in mice not expressing GluR - B [ 51], possibly due to fewer synaptic AMPA channels and impaired AMPAR trafficking and recycling.

The milder phenotype upon GluR - B depletion could be attributed to reduced AMPAR densities at synapses [ 40, 41] and therefore probably to a lesser extent of Ca2 + influx.

A critical step in discerning the discrimination and learning phenotypes from the memory phenotype was the observation of increased variability in the memory of the GluR - B knockout animals and, subsequently, the individual analyses of protein expression levels.

The analysis of quantitative trait loci ( for review, see [ 80]), or classically correlating different behavioral phenotypes within a truly wild - type population [ 81 - 84], also attempts to find common or distinct genetic origins of different behavioral traits.

As a result, purely correlating behavioral traits within a wild - type population usually remains rather descriptive, whereas quantitative trait loci analysis is capable of revealing multigenic basis of behavioral traits but usually lacks the power to identify the individual genes themselves.

According to the paradigm used in this study, a) a normal phenotype results from regulated transcription of a group of genes by one or more transcription factors, b) the corresponding risk - conferring or disease phenotype results from sub - optimal interaction among those same genes, and c) each phenotype is identifiable and distinguishable through virtually - multiplexed transcript abundance analysis.

Over a decade ago the amyloid cascade hypothesis predicted that increased levels of amyloid - beta ( A beta) peptide lead to secondary pathologies that ultimately culminate in the onset of Alzheimer disease ( AD) [ 1].

If, as predicted, overproduction of A beta initiates the cascade of events leading to disease, then therapeutic strategies that lower A beta levels should either arrest or reverse the progression from peptide to dementia.

Intriguingly, all of the dox - reared animals, both transgenic and wild - type, showed altered circadian rhythms with far less distinction between their day - and nighttime activity levels.

Notably, pharmaceutical gamma - secretase inhibitors published to date show less strict regulation of A beta production following chronic administration than we have attained here.

At the latest treatment interval analyzed by ELISA, animals administered dox for 6 mo showed elevated levels of PBS - soluble A beta ( see Figure 5) that could be interpreted as an indication that the plaques are slowly releasing peptide ( or oligomeric A beta) into the soluble pool and might eventually dissolve.

An additional consideration we recognize is that a small amount of transgene expression continues in the presence of dox and that endogenous mouse A beta continues to be produced.

It is also clear that in this genetic system, we have raised the production of A beta to levels not found in humans to accelerate pathology into an experimentally feasible time frame.

This system allowed us to create an approximately 20 - fold differential between APP / A beta synthetic rates before and after treatment, yet the in vivo equilibrium between aggregated and disaggregated states of A beta still favored the maintenance of amyloid deposits.

One potential mechanism by which amyloid may be more efficiently removed in the human disease than in the mouse models is through microglial phagocytosis.	"human	80	85	Organism"	"mouse	106	111	Organism"	"microglial	130	140	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""microglial"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Resident microglia in transgenic mouse models localize to tissue surrounding plaques but show little evidence of amyloid engulfment [ 37 - 40].

Thus, the role of microglia in amyloid metabolism is minor in transgenic models compared to the human condition.

Dox is structurally similar to minocycline, a reported anti - inflammatory drug and inhibitor of microglial activation [ 48].

While it is possible that dox acts in some other way to slow amyloid clearance, data from multiple studies demonstrate that microglial responses are normally weak in the mouse AD models [ 37 - 40], and thus it is doubtful that dox - mediated microglial inhibition affected the outcome of our study.	"microglial	124	134	Cell"	"mouse	170	175	Organism"	"microglial	242	252	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""microglial"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 170, ""end_span"": 175, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""microglial"", ""start_span"": 242, ""end_span"": 252, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
It is, nevertheless, possible that lack of microglia activation is the major difference between the slow clearance described here, where no perturbation of the immune system is expected, and the rapid clearance described in studies involving antibody or viral injection.	"microglia	43	52	Cell"	"antibody	242	250	GO_ontology"	"viral	254	259	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""microglia"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""antibody"", ""start_span"": 242, ""end_span"": 250, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""viral"", ""start_span"": 254, ""end_span"": 259, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This finding reinforces the notion that without continued stimulation, microglia in mouse models do not maintain the same level of sustained activation that may occur in humans.

An immediate extension of this approach is toward dissecting the genetic regulation of complex phenotypes, which would greatly improve the progression from candidate locus to candidate gene.

Gonadal fat mass differed significantly between the sexes in F2 ( p < 10 - 4) and in the parental C3H. ApoE - / - ( p < 0. 05), but not in B6. ApoE - / - mice.

QTL analysis for several clinical traits ( clinical QTLs [ cQTLs]), including the unadjusted raw values for gonadal fat mass, was performed using a single marker regression approach ( justified by the high - density of markers, making interval mapping unnecessary).	"QTL	0	3	Sequence"	"QTLs	52	56	Sequence"	"interval	235	243	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""QTL"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""QTLs"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""interval"", ""start_span"": 235, ""end_span"": 243, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
From these analyses we constructed receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) - like curves to demonstrate that our straightforward method has significantly increased power to detect QTLs compared to QTL mapping methods that do not incorporate sex and genotype - sex interactions ( Figure S1).

Table 5 summarizes the genes that possess these properties for each cQTL, increasing evidence for these genes as potential candidates.

However, they are potentially involved in the pathway ( s) leading from the causative gene to the expression of the fat mass trait ( i. e., their transcription is closely regulated by the causative gene at the locus).	"gene	86	90	Sequence"	"gene	198	202	Sequence"	"locus	210	215	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""gene"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""gene"", ""start_span"": 198, ""end_span"": 202, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""locus"", ""start_span"": 210, ""end_span"": 215, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
As an approach to this problem, we hypothesized that those cQTLs that are most closely associated with liver gene expression would show an overrepresentation of colocalized eQTL for correlated genes, while those loci primarily controlled by other tissues would not have shown this pattern.	"gene	109	113	Sequence"	"genes	193	198	Sequence"	"loci	212	216	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""gene"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 193, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""loci"", ""start_span"": 212, ""end_span"": 216, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
This suggests that the genetic regulation of fat mass for the Chromosome 19 locus is more closely tied to liver gene expression than are the other four fat mass cQTLs.	"genetic	23	30	Sequence"	"Chromosome 19 locus	62	81	Sequence"	"gene	112	116	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""genetic"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Chromosome 19 locus"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""gene"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Analyzing the sexes separately is suboptimal since it reduces sample size in both groups, thus reducing power to detect main QTL effects, as demonstrated by our genome scan of Chromosome 5 ( Figure 1B).	"QTL	125	128	Sequence"	"genome	161	167	Sequence"	"Chromosome	176	186	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""QTL"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""genome"", ""start_span"": 161, ""end_span"": 167, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Chromosome"", ""start_span"": 176, ""end_span"": 186, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
The Chromosome 19 cQTL for fat mass was recently reported by us [ 5] in the BXD intercross F2 progeny from the strains B6 and DBA ( which shares the same haplotype at this region as the C3H strain used in this study).

Furthermore, by treating transcript levels as quantitative traits, we can map the genetic regulation underlying differential gene expression ( eQTLs).

Of these, 304 were cis and 852 were trans, suggesting that only a minority of the sex - specific effects on the regulation of gene expression occur through polymorphisms within the gene itself.

As with cQTLs, sex bias in the predominantly trans genetic regulation of gene expression is likely secondary to different sex hormone profiles.

Recently, using a similar dataset, our group demonstrated that significant cis - eQTLs ( p < 5 x 10 - 5) largely represent true positives [ 30] and are enriched for highly polymorphic regions over the mouse genome.

In an effort to identify genes associated with the fat mass trait, but not necessarily candidate genes underlying the trait cQTLs, we fitted linear models to assess the degree of association between transcripts and gonadal fat mass.

Regardless of which variables are used in the construction of these networks, whether they measure gene expression or protein interactions, accounting for sex specificity, hormonal status, or construction of different networks for females and males would likely more accurately represent the complexity associated with these phenotypes.

Finally, we showed that localization of a subset of liver genes linked in trans to a cQTL region can identify relative tissue contributions to the genetic regulation of a complex trait.

The mice used in the present study, ( NFR / N x B10. Q) x B10.

Since the parental strains differ in susceptibility to CIA, in spite of both having the MHC class II A beta genes [ 15], we wanted to test the susceptibility to inflammatory disease in mice from this cross.

Finally, the NFR / N strain had not previously been used in linkage analyses for detection of CIA - associated loci, which opened ( up) the possibility of detecting new polymorphic genes of importance in this disease.

These findings provide the possibility that mr - s may play a critical role by regulating gene expression in photoreceptor development.

mr - s is preferentially expressed in the photoreceptors at postnatal day 3 - 6 ( P3 - 6), when photoreceptors undergo terminal differentiation, and in the adult pineal gland.

To determine the tissue specificity of mr - s expression, the expression of the mr - s gene in various adult tissues was examined by Northern hybridization ( Fig. 2H).

The mr - s probe did not detect a band in the adult tissues examined, indicating that these tissues do not express mr - s at a level comparable to that of the developing retina.

Transcription factors Otx2 and Crx are known to be key regulators of retinal photoreceptor development [ 3, 8, 9].

In the Crx KO retina, the mr - s transcript was dramatically reduced ( Fig. 3B).

Taken together, these data indicate that mr - s transcription is regulated by Crx in the developing photoreceptors and pineal gland.

Our GAL4 assay indicated that the signal when the full - length mr - s was present in both the bait and prey contexts was weaker than when isolated SAM domains were used.

To investigate whether the homophilic association of mr - s is required for transcriptional repression, two site - directed mutants, DBD - W404A and DBD - G453A, either of which may reduce self - binding ability, were analyzed ( Fig. 7C).

However, these in vitro experiments using HEK293T and Y79 cells strongly support our hypothesis that mr - s functions as a transcriptional repressor in developing photoreceptors.

In the present study, we identified a novel gene, mr - s, which is predominantly expressed in retinal photoreceptors and the pineal gland.

To characterize the biochemical function of mr - s, we performed yeast two - hybrid screening using full - length mr - s as the bait.

Previously, using comparative immunohistochemistry, we and others have shown an up to 70% reduction of TFIIH levels in primary fibroblasts from patients with TTD compared with wt controls due to reduced stability [ 16, 17].

Although phenotypic consequences, referred to here as biallelic effects, resulting from two different mutant alleles in compound heterozygote patients have been postulated, such effects have historically been difficult to distinguish from the influence of environment and genetic background.

In the third type of biallelic effect, known as interallelic complementation, two mutant alleles produced a phenotype closer to wt than either could alone in a homo - or hemizygous state.

The preblastocyst - stage homozygous lethality shared by the XpdKO, Xpd + XPCS, and Xpd + XP alleles most likely reflects a defect in basal transcription that is incompatible with life.

Our data suggest that certain presumed null alleles, although unable on their own to support basal transcription, may in fact have a substantial impact on disease outcome in compound heterozygous humans, as they do in mouse models.

These data evidence a key role for p150CAF - 1 during pre - implantation development, and reveal that this protein is required for the proper 3 - D organization of heterochromatin within embryonic cell nuclei.

DAPI - dense foci were lost, and we observed diffuse HP1 alpha and DAPI staining around the nucleoli and at the periphery of the nucleus ( Figure 2B).

p150CAF - 1 depletion in MEFs resulted in a strong inhibition of cell proliferation ( unpublished data), but did not alter the clustering of heterochromatin domains ( Figures 2C and S2).

However, 24 h later, ES cells cease to proliferate and die, revealing that p150CAF - 1 is required for an essential cellular process, as in embryos.

In p150CAF - 1 RNAi - depleted cells, we observed a disruption of pericentric heterochromatin clusters that coincides with the disappearance of DAPI - dense foci ( Figure 4B).

In contrast, centric domains showed an intensity and shape similar to control cells, suggesting that they remain unaffected by p150CAF - 1 depletion ( Figure 4C and 4D).	"domains	21	28	Sequence"	"cells	78	83	Cell"	"p150CAF - 1	127	138	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""domains"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We found that pericentric DNA was immunoprecipitated with a 2 - fold lower efficiency with H4K20me3 [ 29, 30] antibodies following p150CAF - 1 depletion ( Figure 7A and 7B).	"pericentric DNA	14	29	GO_ontology"	"antibodies	110	120	GO_ontology"	"p150CAF - 1	131	142	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""pericentric DNA"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""antibodies"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Immunoprecipitation of minor satellite repeats in the same experiment was less affected ( Figure 7B), showing that loss of p150CAF - 1 function mainly affects H4K20me3 at pericentric heterochromatin.	"satellite repeats	29	46	Sequence"	"p150CAF - 1	123	134	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"pericentric heterochromatin	171	198	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""satellite repeats"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""pericentric heterochromatin"", ""start_span"": 171, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
This result shows that p150CAF - 1 contributes to normal levels of H4K20me3 at pericentric heterochromatin, but not necessarily at other loci.

H3K9me3 was severely perturbed in p150CAF - 1 - depleted cells, displaying a diffuse pattern similar to HP1 alpha ( Figure 7C).

Altogether, our results show that depletion of CAF - 1 in ES cells leads to a simultaneous disruption of heterochromatin 3 - D organization and an alteration in epigenetic marking.	"CAF - 1	47	54	GO_ontology"	"cells	61	66	Cell"	"heterochromatin	105	120	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""heterochromatin"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Here, we provide evidence that p150CAF - 1 has a crucial function during mouse early embryogenesis and in ES cells.

Previous studies showed that CAF - 1 is essential for the progression of DNA replication in vertebrates.

In Xenopus laevis, p150CAF - 1 function is required for the rapid cell divisions that occur during early development [ 33].	"Xenopus laevis	3	17	Organism"	"p150CAF - 1	19	30	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cell	66	70	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Xenopus laevis"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Ultimately, p150CAF - 1 depletion results in the arrest of ES cell division and cell death.	"p150CAF - 1	12	23	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cell	62	66	Cell"	"cell	80	84	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This important function of CAF - 1 in pluripotent embryonic cells could be partially conserved during evolution.	"CAF - 1	27	34	GO_ontology"	"cells	60	65	Cell"	"conserved	85	94	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""conserved"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
This phenotype is somehow reminiscent of loss of CAF - 1 - mediated defects in heterochromatin organization in early mouse embryos.	"CAF - 1	49	56	GO_ontology"	"heterochromatin	79	94	GO_ontology"	"mouse	117	122	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""heterochromatin"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These data suggest that proper nuclear organization and epigenetic marking of pericentric heterochromatin are coupled in ES cells.	"nuclear	31	38	GO_ontology"	"pericentric heterochromatin	78	105	GO_ontology"	"cells	124	129	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""pericentric heterochromatin"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
CAF - 1 is essential in mammals but dispensable in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [ 38].	"CAF - 1	0	7	GO_ontology"	"mammals	24	31	Organism"	"Saccharomyces cerevisiae	51	75	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""mammals"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Saccharomyces cerevisiae"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In mammals, H3K9 dimethylation is predominantly associated with H3. 1, but not with H3. 3, which carries modifications typically found in transcribed chromatin regions [ 39].	"mammals	3	10	Organism"	"modifications	105	118	Sequence"	"chromatin regions	150	167	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""mammals"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""modifications"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""chromatin regions"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 167, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Outside of the centromeric H3 variant, S. cerevisiae possesses only H3. 3, which is expressed and incorporated into chromatin in a replication - independent fashion in higher eukaryotes [ 12].	"variant	30	37	Sequence"	"chromatin	116	125	GO_ontology"	"eukaryotes	175	185	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""variant"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""chromatin"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""eukaryotes"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 185, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
One possibility would be a scenario in which incorporation of H3. 1 into chromatin is required for the proper nuclear organization of constitutive heterochromatin in an embryonic context.	"chromatin	73	82	GO_ontology"	"nuclear	110	117	GO_ontology"	"heterochromatin	147	162	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""chromatin"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""heterochromatin"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 162, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
While this has to be addressed experimentally, it is worthwhile to mention an alternate possible mechanism that might explain the disruption of heterochromatin domains in p150CAF - 1 null embryos and ES cells.	"heterochromatin domains	144	167	GO_ontology"	"p150CAF - 1	171	182	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cells	203	208	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""heterochromatin domains"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 167, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 171, ""end_span"": 182, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 203, ""end_span"": 208, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
CAF - 1 could be required for the loading, into heterochromatin, of an interacting partner required for the clustering of pericentric domains.

A potential candidate is the HP1 protein, which interacts with CAF - 1 [ 13, 16].

In agreement with a recent report [ 40], our analysis of heterochromatin in pre - implantation embryos has revealed drastic changes in nuclear organization between the two - cell and blastocyst stages.

Rb absence impairs cell cycle exit and triggers death of some neurons, so differentiation defects may well be indirect.

Indeed, we show that abnormalities in both differentiation and light - evoked electrophysiological responses in Rb - deficient retinal cells are rescued when ectopic division and apoptosis are blocked specifically by deleting E2f transcription factor ( E2f) 1.

In contrast, Rb is thought to promote differentiation by potentiating tissue - specific transcription factors, although differentiation defects in Rb null cells could be an indirect consequence of E2f - driven division and death.

Rather than potentiating a cell - specific factor, Rb promotes starburst cell differentiation by inhibiting another E2f, E2f3a.

This cell - cycle - independent activity broadens the importance of the Rb - E2f pathway, and suggests we should reassess its role in the differentiation of other cell types.

Its development proceeds through three overlapping steps starting with retinal progenitor cell ( RPC) proliferation, followed by birth of post - mitotic retinal transition cells ( RTCs, also referred to as precursors), and ending with terminal differentiation of seven major cell types ( Figure 1A) [ 1].

Indeed, E2f3 - induced apoptosis in fibroblasts has recently been shown to require E2f1 [ 15].

Thus, it is controversial whether E2f3 is required for apoptosis of any Rb KO cell type.

Determining which activating E2fs promote death in distinct Rb KO tissues requires conditional rather than germ line models of Rb deletion to avoid secondary indirect effects ( such as hypoxia).

E2f3b, like repressive E2fs, is present in both quiescent and dividing cells, and in quiescent fibroblasts it associates primarily with Rb, suggesting that it mediates repression [ 16 - 18].

In the retina, others have noted abnormally shaped Rb KO rods and have suggested Rb may directly promote their morphogenesis by activating retina - specific factors [ 29].

Contrary to the prevailing view that Rb promotes differentiation through E2f - independent tissue - specific transcription factors, we show that Rb facilitates SAC development through E2f3.

E2f3 is also present in a specific subset of other CNS neurons, implying that this may be a general mechanism by which Rb facilitates neurogenesis.

To define the mechanism in even more detail, we determined which E2f3 isoform Rb targets to control SAC differentiation.

Using an isoform - specific null mouse we show that Rb drives SAC differentiation through E2f3a.

To measure ectopic cell division, mice were pulse - labelled with bromodeoxyuridine ( BrdU) 2 h before sacrifice and the peripheral retina analyzed for BrdU incorporation by immunofluorescence.

This is easily detected at E14, E16, and postnatal day ( P) 0 in the inner retina where abnormal BrdU + ganglion and amacrine RTCs are located, or on the outermost region of the P0 retina, where BrdU + photoreceptor RTCs reside ( Figures S1A and S2, arrows) [ 2].

Ectopic RTC division in Rb KO retinas is even more obvious at P8 or P18, when division is completed in wild - type ( WT) retina ( Figures 1C and S1A).

Strikingly, the ectopically positioned S - phase cells at E14, E16, and P0 and all the abnormal division at P8 and P18 were completely suppressed in the Rb / E2f1 DKO retina ( Figures 1C, 1E, 1F, S1A, and S2).

It was suggested that Rb might regulate photoreceptor differentiation, possibly through rod - specific transcription factors ( Figure 1B) [ 29].

The morphology of E2f1 KO neurons was WT ( Figure 2A).

Slightly reduced cell numbers were not due to residual RTC death since we have not observed ectopic apoptosis at any embryonic or postnatal stage in the developing Rb / E2f1 DKO retina ( Figures 1D, 1G, and S2).	"cell	17	21	Cell"	"Rb	164	166	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"E2f1	169	173	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 166, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""E2f1"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, slightly reduced RPC division and dramatic rescue of severe defects in Rb KO RTCs are distinct effects stemming from the deletion of E2f1.

The presence of Chat in some cell bodies but never in processes ( Figure 3B) also suggests a transport defect.

Inactivating E2f1 and E2f3 together rescues the ectopic mitosis, cell death, and SAC defects.

This marker is expressed in both SACs and ganglion cells, thus Isl1 + cells in the INL are exclusively SACs [ 49].	"ganglion cells	42	56	Cell"	"Isl1	63	67	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cells	70	75	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""ganglion cells"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Isl1"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
It is also expressed earlier than Slc18a3, permitting analysis of SACs soon after their birth at ~ E15; thus, we could study retina at P0, a time when ectopic division is high in the inner retina and prior to Rb - independent cell cycle exit associated with terminal differentiation [ 2].

Indeed, about one - third of all Isl1 + cells in the entire inner NBL were dividing in the Rb KO retina, or ~ 50% in the periphery where Cre is expressed ( Figure 4E and data not shown).	"Isl1	33	37	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cells	40	45	Cell"	"Rb	91	93	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Isl1"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We did not solve this issue for E2f1 or E2f2, but used a modified protocol [ 50] to successfully track E2f3 expression ( Figure 5).	"E2f1	32	36	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"E2f2	40	44	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"E2f3	103	107	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""E2f1"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""E2f2"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""E2f3"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
By P18, E2f3 was also detected in two tracks in the IPL ( Figure 5A and 5B), reminiscent of SAC markers such as Chat and Slc18a3 ( c. f. Figures 3 and 4).	"E2f3	8	12	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Chat	112	116	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Slc18a3	121	128	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""E2f3"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Chat"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Slc18a3"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The antibody that worked in immunostaining recognizes a C - terminal region and thus, does not distinguish a / b isoforms.

To our knowledge, the subcellular location of E2f3 isoforms has not been determined in any cell type.

Consistent with the drop in E2f3 - expressing cells during WT retinal maturation ( Figure 5A), the total amount of E2f3a was less at P18 compared to P0 ( Figure 6).

Error bars represent SD of measurements from three animals, and asterisks indicate a significant difference between WT and the indicated genotypes ( *, p < 0. 05; * *; p < 0. 01; ANOVA and Tukey HSD test).

Thus, separate from its role in cell cycle control, Rb regulation of E2f3a is critical to ensure proper neuronal differentiation.

Work in the early 1990s showed that Rb loss triggers defects in neuronal cell cycle exit, survival, and differentiation [ 26 - 28].	"Rb	36	38	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"neuronal	64	72	Cell"	"cell	73	77	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Here, deleting E2f1 specifically rescued ectopic division and death in the Rb KO retina.	"deleting	6	14	Sequence"	"E2f1	15	19	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Rb	75	77	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""deleting"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""E2f1"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In any case, it is clear that in most retinal cells, including photoreceptors [ 29], transcription factors that promote differentiation function independently of Rb.	"cells	46	51	Cell"	"photoreceptors	63	77	Cell"	"Rb	162	164	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""photoreceptors"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 162, ""end_span"": 164, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, deregulated E2f1 activity in the retina, whether resulting from the inactivation of Rb or from overexpression, promotes unscheduled cell division and triggers apoptosis in susceptible RTCs.	"E2f1	18	22	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Rb	90	92	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cell	138	142	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""E2f1"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
There was a slightly lower response in the Rb / E2f1 DKO retina relative to the E2f1 KO control retina.	"Rb	43	45	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"E2f1	48	52	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"E2f1	80	84	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""E2f1"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""E2f1"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, E2f3 inhibition is the first, and may be the only, mechanism by which Rb participates directly in neuronal differentiation.	"E2f3	6	10	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Rb	76	78	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"neuronal	104	112	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""E2f3"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
To further dissect the mechanism of action of Rb in SACs we determined the E2f3 isoform it targets to promote differentiation.	"Rb	46	48	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"E2f3	75	79	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"isoform	80	87	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""E2f3"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""isoform"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
However, in the first work to our knowledge to examine the function of any E2f protein isoform in vivo, we made the surprising observation that Rb regulates SAC differentiation through E2f3a ( Figure 8).	"protein	79	86	Chemical"	"isoform	87	94	Sequence"	"Rb	144	146	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""isoform"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Nevertheless, our data prove that Rb definitely regulates SAC differentiation through the activating E2f3 isoform.	"Rb	34	36	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"E2f3	101	105	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"isoform	106	113	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""E2f3"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""isoform"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
E2f3a is both nuclear and cytoplasmic, but E2f3b is always nuclear.	"nuclear	14	21	GO_ontology"	"cytoplasmic	26	37	GO_ontology"	"nuclear	59	66	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""cytoplasmic"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
However, even E2f3b, which lacks this domain, binds and is regulated by Ccna2 [ 18], so the domain difference may not explain the unique distributions we observed.	"domain	38	44	Sequence"	"Ccna2	72	77	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"domain	92	98	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""domain"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Ccna2"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""domain"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Indeed, immunostaining revealed that Rb and E2f3 colocalize to SAC processes.

Early overexpression studies in vitro suggested Rb might temper expansion of cycling cells, but KO studies in vivo indicate that its major role is to block division in terminally differentiating cells.	"Rb	48	50	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cells	85	90	Cell"	"cells	195	200	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 195, ""end_span"": 200, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In the case of SACs, the differentiation defects we observed ( e. g., loss of Slc18a3 and Chat) were not due to aberrant division, but it is possible there are other problems with these cells that are caused by ectopic division.	"Slc18a3	78	85	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Chat	90	94	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cells	186	191	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Slc18a3"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Chat"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 186, ""end_span"": 191, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Others have suggested that Rb promotes differentiation in non - neuronal cells through E2f - independent means [ 31 - 33].

However, these studies did not assess whether these cell types differentiate normally if Rb is deleted along with one or more E2f family members.
