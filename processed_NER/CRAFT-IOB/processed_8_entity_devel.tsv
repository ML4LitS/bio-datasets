Since the human MCOLN1 gene encodes a single transcript [ 7 - 9], we carried out additional hybridizations with probes generated from various regions of the coding sequence and 3 ' UTR, and all probes identified the same two transcripts in the mouse ( data not shown).

However, given the intron / exon structure of this apparently complete gene, it appears likely that trTACC1B is active in the pufferfish, and presumably fulfils either a temporal - spatial specific function within the organism, or a distinct function from the larger trTACC1A product within the cell.

Although the analysis of T. rubripes, rodents and humans so far suggests that the vertebrate TACC3 precursor was not included in the second round of genomic duplication, it could not be excluded that a TACC4 gene may have been lost during the evolution of these lineages.

Significantly, sequence and phylogenetic analysis of coiled coil proteins ( Fig. 1) clearly shows that RHAMM does not contain a TACC domain and instead forms a distinct family of proteins in the coiled coil superfamily, and is not a direct descendant of the ancestral TACC gene.

Interestingly, these three clusters are located on different chromosomes in mouse and rat ( Fig. 2), further suggesting that this cluster of genes was transposed into this region after the primate / rodent divergence.

In combination with the examination of the T. rubripes genome, this also provides additional evidence that either the second round of duplication of the chromosomal segment that contained the FGFR3 / 4 ancestor did not include a TACC gene, or that such a gene was lost very early in vertebrate evolution, prior to the divergence of the Gnanthostome lineages.

The results of our functional analysis, as well as other published data clearly indicate that the vertebrate TACCs interact with proteins that can be divided into two broad categories: 1) proteins with roles in centrosome / mitotic spindle dynamics, and 2) proteins involved in gene regulation, either at the level of transcription, or subsequent RNA processing and translation [ 3, 5 - 7, 15, 19 - 21, 24, 25, 33, 34].

Thus, alternative splicing of the TACC1 gene adds further diversity to TACC1 function, as the deletion of specific exons and their associated binding domains will change the potential protein complexes with which they can associate, either directly, or by redirecting the splice variants to different subcellular compartments.

The second cell population in the ONL of the rd7 retina has some of the nuclear features of normal rods, such as a single, dense mass of heterochromatin and moderately electron - dense euchromatin ( Figure 7H); yet these cells also show features of cones.

In contrast to the marked derepression of the vast majority of cone - specific genes in the rd7 mutant, two genes stand out as being unaffected by the mutation: the gene encoding M - opsin and Thrb2.

It is possible that there are gene regulatory differences between mice and humans such that in human NR2E3 mutants, S - opsin shows a type I pattern of derepression rather than a type II as in seen in the rd7 mouse, and is therefore expressed in all of the hybrid photoreceptor cells.

Given the similarity of the Atrx - and Hand1 - mutant phenotypes and the likelihood that Atrx acts as a transcriptional regulator by modifying chromatin structure, it will be of interest to determine whether Atrx is itself a regulator of Hand1 expression, or alternatively whether it acts as a co - regulator of one or more of the downstream transcriptional targets of Hand1.

As with the Itpr1opt / opt mice, where the deletion of exons 43 and 44 is also predicted to leave the translational reading frame unaffected, the in - frame Itpr1 Delta 18 / Delta 18 deletion mutation results in markedly decreased levels of Itpr1 in cerebellar Purkinje cells.

However, visualization of log R ratio and B allele frequency metrics from the genome - wide SNP genotyping experiments clearly showed data consistent with a heterozygous genomic deletion across the first one - third of ITPR1 and across the first half of a neighboring gene, SUMF1 ( Figure 2).

Sequencing of this fragment revealed a deletion of 201, 509 bp ( Figure S3), removing the first three of the nine exons of SUMF1 and the first ten of the 58 exons of ITPR1.

The site of mutation is of interest, particularly the fact that in each of the three families the telomeric end of the deletion is anchored between exons 3 and 4 of SUMF1; sequence searches failed to identify any repeat sequences that might explain this phenomenon.

Conversely, mutation of ITPR1 is biologically plausible as a cause of ataxia: the protein is highly expressed in Purkinje cells; as we have shown here, mice with mutation at this locus present with ataxia; and perturbed Ca2 + signaling has previously been implicated in the etiology of ataxia, notably in episodic ataxia type 2 and SCA6 [ 8].

Second, we cannot rule out the existence of an alternate start site for ITPR1 that may result in a product that confers a pathogenic gain of function to the protein; however, Western blot analysis of cells derived from affected AUS1 family members, which was performed using an antibody raised against the C - terminal portion of ITPR1, failed to identify any disease - specific truncated protein products.
