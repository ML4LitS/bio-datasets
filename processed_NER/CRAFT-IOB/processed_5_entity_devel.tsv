Loss of Tbx15 affects dorsoventral transitions of hair length, pigment content, and expression of the ventral - specific Agouti isoform; however, the former two effects are subtle and contribute little, if at all, to the abnormal pigmentation of adult deH / deH mice.

Two of us ( S. Kuijper and F.

For example, while the expanded domain of Agouti expression in postnatal deH / deH animals can be traced to events that occur between E11. 5 and E13. 5, the underlying cause may be that embryonic cells in dorsolateral mesenchyme acquire a ventral rather than dorsal identity or that those cells fail to proliferate normally, followed by compensatory expansion of ventral cells.

These considerations notwithstanding, control of dorsoventral trunk pattern by Tbx15 shares certain features with control of dorsoventral limb patterning by Lmx1b, a LIM domain transcription factor that acts downstream of Wnt7a and En1 ( Riddle et al. 1995; Vogel et al. 1995; Cygan et al. 1997; Logan et al. 1997; Loomis et al. 1998; Chen and Johnson 2002).

Mildly food - deprived female wild - type and dopamine D2 receptor deficient mice rapidly learned to retrieve and consume visible food reinforcers from a small plastic dish.

However, the dopamine D2 receptor deficient mice required significantly more trials than wild - type mice to discriminate between two dishes, each filled with a different scented sand, and to associate one of the two odors with the presence of a reinforcer ( food).

Administration of the D2R / D3R antagonist, sulpiride, impairs spatial reversal leaning in mice [ 20] and has also been shown to impair attention and the cognitive performances of healthy human volunteers [ 21].

Therefore, the number of D2R + / + mice represented in session # 1 is 8, in session # 2 n = 8, session # 3 n = 6 ( 2 mice met our criterion), in session # 4 n = 5 ( three met the criterion).

An analysis of the time course of responding for errors of commission across the first four reversal sessions revealed that the D2R - / - committed several more errors of commission than the D2R + / + mice ( * p < 0. 001).

Whereas exon shuffling can drive the functional diversification of gene families over evolutionary time, the temporal and / or tissue specific alternative splicing of a gene can give rise to functional diversification of a single gene during the development of an organism.

In nine mice examined at E11. 5, all lungs showed a specific enhancement of Fog2 expression in the mesenchyme surrounding the accessory bud and the right middle lobe bud, which are the lobes that do not develop normally in Fog2 mutant mice ( Figure 5).

We hypothesize that Fog2 is required ( either directly or indirectly) for the induction of HGF in the developing diaphragm, and dysregulation of HGF patterning along the path of muscle precursor cell migration between the PPF and the diaphragm accounts for the abnormal phenotype in these mice.

Microarray and in situ hybridization analyses revealed a modest increase in the number of S - opsin - positive cells and widespread derepression of many cone - specific genes within rod photoreceptor cells.

In order to rule out the possibility that these scattered positive cells were simply the normal complement of cones that had failed to localize their cell bodies to the scleral edge of the ONL, the number of positive cells in the rd7 retina was quantitated by dissociated cell in situ hybridization.

Dissociated cell in situ hybridization was performed using a probe for the S - cone opsin gene ( Opn1sw), which shows type II derepression ( Figures 2 and 3A - 3C).

Previous studies have estimated that the total number of cones in the mouse retina is 2% of all retinal cells [ 20], and that S - opsin is largely repressed in cones in the dorsal third of the retina [ 21].

In addition to the ten genes that showed cone - specific expression in the wild - type retina, another 11 novel genes were derepressed in the rd7 retina by in situ hybridization ( Figure 1, genes G36 - G46).

In sharp contrast to changes in cone gene expression, rod - specific genes were much less severely affected in the rd7 mutant.

This latter finding suggests that all the rod - and many cone - specific genes are coexpressed in the majority of photoreceptors in the rd7 mutant.

Analysis of several photoreceptor transcription factors in the rd7 mutant indicated that the levels of Crx and Nrl are unaffected in the mutant at P14 ( see Figure 2, lower right photomicrographs).

In contrast to what is seen in the Nrl mutant, Nr2e3 expression is unchanged in Crx mutant homozygotes ( unpublished data).

It has a single, large clump of dense heterochromatin, a thin rim of moderately electron - dense euchromatin, and very scant juxtanuclear cytoplasm without organelles [ 26, 27].

Such juxtanuclear organelles are only very rarely seen in normal rods ( 1. 5%; six out of 399 cells counted), but are common in cones ( yellow arrow in Figure 7H).

In this paper we have determined that the primary role of the rod - specific transcription factor, Nr2e3, is to maintain cone genes transcriptionally silent within rods.

Consistent with the hybrid pattern of gene expression in these cells, electron microscopic analysis revealed them to be morphologically intermediate between normal rods and cones.

As mentioned above, Nrl is a retinal transcription factor that, when mutated, results in en masse conversion of rods into S - opsin - expressing cones [ 24].

Both studies showed that cone genes in addition to S - cone opsin are derepressed in the mouse rd7 mutant.

Although we found Elovl2 to have a cone - enriched pattern of expression ( see Figure 1), in situ hybridization analysis of Fabp7 failed to show a signal in wild - type or mutant retina ( unpublished data).

The gene expression changes identified in the rd7 mutant retina in the present study suggest the scheme of gene regulation in mouse rods depicted in Figure 8.

In contrast to the rd7 mutant, Notch1 - / - retinas show marked derepression of Thrb2 and a corresponding derepression of the gene that encodes M - opsin.

Furthermore, prior studies have suggested differences in glycogen and glucose metabolism between primate rods and cones [ 35].	"glycogen	57	65	Chemical"	"glucose	70	77	Chemical"	"primate	97	104	Organism"	"rods	105	109	Cell"	"cones	114	119	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""glycogen"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""primate"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""rods"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cones"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
One of the most curious findings in the rd7 mutant retina was the occurrence of two different types of changes: an increase in the number of S - opsin - expressing cones and a transformation of rods into hybrid photoreceptors.	"mutant	44	50	Sequence"	"S - opsin	141	150	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cones	164	169	Cell"	"rods	194	198	Cell"	"photoreceptors	211	225	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""S - opsin"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cones"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 169, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""rods"", ""start_span"": 194, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""photoreceptors"", ""start_span"": 211, ""end_span"": 225, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
An alternative explanation would be that there is only a single, homogeneous population of postmitotic rod precursors in the mouse, and a stochastic event triggers assumption of the S - cone fate in a small subpopulation of these cells in the rd7 mutant.	"rod	103	106	Cell"	"mouse	125	130	Organism"	"cone	186	190	Cell"	"cells	230	235	Cell"	"mutant	247	253	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 186, ""end_span"": 190, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 230, ""end_span"": 235, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 247, ""end_span"": 253, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Alternatively, the ratio of supernumerary S - cones to hybrid photoreceptors produced in the retina of ESCS patients might be such that a higher percentage of the presumptive rods in ESCS patients become S - cones rather than hybrid photoreceptors.	"cones	46	51	Cell"	"photoreceptors	62	76	Cell"	"rods	175	179	Cell"	"cones	208	213	Cell"	"photoreceptors	233	247	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cones"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""photoreceptors"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""rods"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 179, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cones"", ""start_span"": 208, ""end_span"": 213, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""photoreceptors"", ""start_span"": 233, ""end_span"": 247, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The coexpression of both rod and cone genes in the same cell could predispose the cell to apoptosis.

Overexpression of wild - type crumbs in Drosophila has been shown to cause polarity defects leading to waviness of epithelia and even to misalignment of nuclei within photoreceptors analogous to what is seen in the rd7 retina [ 47, 51].

Concomitantly, levels of the amino acids alanine, glutamate, and glutamine, whose synthesis is linked with normal metabolism of BCAA, were decreased ( Table 1).

Because of the phenotypic similarities of the rescue mice to the human patients, these genetically engineered mice represent a useful small animal model of the intermediate form of MSUD.

An ENU mouse resembling human MSUD was previously created by disrupting the mitochondrial BCAT gene [ 20].

The most significant opportunity presented by the MSUD mouse models is to test novel treatments such as gene [ 38 - 41] and cell based therapies ( e. g., hepatocytes [ 42, 43] or embryonic stem cells [ 44]).

Relevant to gene therapy, recent problems with gene therapy in humans highlight the importance and critical need of animal models of genetic diseases for preclinical studies.

Recent cell culture studies with MSUD cells have suggested that the thiamin - responsive phenotype is dependent upon the presence of at least one E2 expressing allele [ 45, 46].	"cell	7	11	Cell"	"cells	38	43	Cell"	"thiamin	68	75	Chemical"	"E2	146	148	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"allele	160	166	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 7, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""thiamin"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""E2"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""allele"", ""start_span"": 160, ""end_span"": 166, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
In light of these newer findings, our intermediate MSUD mouse provides a model to test the effect of thiamin with respect to BCKDH activity and blood amino acid levels at the level of the whole animal.

Mutations in ATRX provided the first example of a human genetic disease associated with defects in such proteins.

To address this question, the authors deleted the version of the gene in mice, Atrx.

Disease - causing missense mutations are clustered in two regions of the gene: a PHD - like zinc finger domain and a SNF2 - like ATPase domain ( Figure 1) [ 6].	"mutations	27	36	Sequence"	"regions of the gene	58	77	Sequence"	"zinc	92	96	Chemical"	"domain	104	110	Sequence"	"domain	136	142	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""mutations"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""regions of the gene"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""zinc"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""domain"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""domain"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
The consistent core of clinical and haematological features observed in ATR - X patients suggests that, like the SWI2 / SNF2 chromatin - remodelling protein, ATRX probably regulates transcription of a discrete set of target genes.	"X	78	79	GO_ontology"	"chromatin	125	134	GO_ontology"	"protein	149	156	Chemical"	"ATRX	158	162	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"genes	224	229	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""X"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""chromatin"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 149, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""ATRX"", ""start_span"": 158, ""end_span"": 162, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 224, ""end_span"": 229, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
The failure to recover targeted clones with these vectors suggested that Atrx may be important for normal ES cell growth and expansion and that direct targeting of the single locus may not be possible.	"clones	32	38	Sequence"	"vectors	50	57	Sequence"	"Atrx	73	77	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cell	109	113	Cell"	"locus	175	180	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""clones"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""vectors"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Atrx"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""locus"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 180, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
As expected, the truncated Atrxt isoform, the transcript of which is terminated within intron 11 [ 4], is unaffected by the deletion of exon 18 ( Figure 2E).

Surprisingly, both Atrxnull ES cell clones exhibited a cell cycle profile that was indistinguishable from ES cells bearing a functional Atrx allele ( AtrxWT or Atrxflox).

Finally, we investigated whether the growth defect in the Atrxnull ES cells was due to an up - regulation of apoptosis by staining cells with Annexin V ( Figure S2) and found that the proportion of apoptotic cells was not significantly affected by the absence of full - length Atrx.

Notably, the transcribed region of the ribosomal DNA ( rDNA) repeat was found to be significantly hypomethylated in ATR - X patients relative to normal individuals.	"ribosomal	39	48	GO_ontology"	"DNA	49	52	Sequence"	"repeat	61	67	Sequence"	"ATR - X	116	123	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"individuals	152	163	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""ribosomal"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""DNA"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""repeat"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""ATR - X"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""individuals"", ""start_span"": 152, ""end_span"": 163, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The observation that rDNA is hypomethylated in the absence of Atrx, even in ES cells, is consistent with the finding that hypomethylation of the human rDNA repeats is detectable from an early developmental stage in ATR - X patients.

To investigate the role of the Atrx protein during mouse development, we initially established lines of mice bearing the Atrxflox allele.

We found that the population of Pl - 1 - expressing cells was depleted in the decidual implantation sites containing Atrxnull embryos relative to those containing wild - type littermates ( Figure 7B); this was also apparent at 7. 5 dpc, as determined by immunohistochemical staining of paraffin sections of embryos in deciduas with an anti - Pl - 1 antibody ( Figure 7C).

In contrast, it was recently shown that the loss of Atrx markedly increased the apoptotic population in the differentiating cells of the embryonic cortex and postnatal hippocampus, when Atrx expression was ablated in the developing mouse forebrain using the Atrxflox allele described here [ 20].

The human ATRX protein has been shown to associate in a complex with Daxx [ 8], a protein that has been implicated in multiple pathways for the regulation of apoptosis [ 21].

Hand1 - mutant conceptuses arrest at around 7. 5 dpc and display a normal embryonic compartment, but, like Atrx - mutant embryos, ablation of Hand1 causes a reduction in the size of the ectoplacental cone and density of TGCs [ 28].

The survival of Atrx carrier females contrasts with the phenotypes seen in carriers of mutations of other murine X - linked genes known to be essential in the extraembryonic compartment.	"Atrx	16	20	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutations	87	96	Sequence"	"murine	106	112	Organism"	"X	113	114	GO_ontology"	"genes	124	129	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Atrx"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutations"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""murine"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""X"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Thus, unlike Atrx, these genes and / or their effects on cell growth are unable to circumvent the processes that ultimately cause all cells in the extraembryonic tissues to express only the maternally derived X chromosome.	"Atrx	13	17	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"genes	25	30	Sequence"	"cell	57	61	Cell"	"cells in the extraembryonic tissues	134	169	Cell"	"X chromosome	209	221	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Atrx"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells in the extraembryonic tissues"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 169, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""X chromosome"", ""start_span"": 209, ""end_span"": 221, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Another possible mechanism is that inactivation of the paternal X proceeds normally in all cells, but subsequently the Atrx gene within individual cells is reactivated.	"X	64	65	GO_ontology"	"cells	91	96	Cell"	"Atrx	119	123	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"gene	124	128	Sequence"	"cells	147	152	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""X"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Atrx"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""gene"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In both of these cases, other genes on the paternal X chromosome must be inactivated and remain so, since blocking inactivation of the entire Xp chromosome causes embryonic lethality due to biallelic expression of X - linked genes in the trophoblast [ 39].

In older P17 mice, the histopathology and keratin expression pattern of the mutant thymus was similar to that of P13 except for the fact that beta - catenin expression became increasingly diffuse and appeared to colocalize with K8 / K14 expression ( data not shown).

Our finding that K14 - driven Apc loss in embryonic ectoderm resulted in irregularly spaced and often tightly clustered abnormal hair placode initiation and follicle morphogenesis ( Figures 4F, 5B, 5D, and 5F) as well as in the development of multiple tooth buds ( Figure 4O and 4P), is in line with the effects seen in activation of epithelial beta - catenin signaling during placode formation, indicating the role of Apc in specification of embryonic ectodermal stem cells to produce a hair follicle.

Given the role of Apc in down - regulation of beta - catenin, loss of Apc would inevitably lead to altered expression of beta - catenin in ectodermal cells during the hair placode formation, giving rise to aberrant follicular growth throughout the embryonic epidermis, including the footpads, where normally hairless ( Figure 5B, 5D, 5F, and 5H).
