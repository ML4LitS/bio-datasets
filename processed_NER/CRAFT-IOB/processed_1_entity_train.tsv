In a common theme of organogenesis, certain cells within a multipotent epithelial sheet exchange signals with their neighbors and develop into a bud structure.	"cells	44	49	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In the epidermis, Snail misexpression leads to hyperproliferation and a reduction in intercellular adhesion.	"Snail	18	23	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The development of a bud requires a number of coordinated changes in the behavior of the targeted cells within an epithelial sheet.	"cells	98	103	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
During development, specialized mesenchymal cells populate the skin in a spatially defined pattern to initiate the complex epithelial - mesenchymal crosstalk that will specify the bud [ 3].

This provides a framework for conceptualizing why E - cadherin levels appear to impact upon a plethora of developmental processes ( reviewed in [ 11]).

This exquisite pattern appears to be functionally relevant since altering it in vivo correspondingly affects features associated with hair bud formation, including down - regulation of E - cadherin, increased proliferation, and repressed terminal differentiation.

The range of developmental processes in which Snail family members have been implicated thus includes the type of epithelial remodeling that is observed in hair follicle bud formation.

Embryonic day 17. 5 ( E17. 5) was chosen, since the multiple waves of follicle morphogenesis occurring at this time enabled us to evaluate Snail expression at different stages of the process.

However, like placodes, hair buds exhibited down - regulation in E - cadherin expression ( Figure 1H; see also [ 4]).	"E - cadherin	65	77	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""E - cadherin"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

Typical of most hyperproliferating conditions, Snail expression led to a large expansion in layers with spinous and granular morphology.	"Snail	47	52	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
With age, however, epidermal folds and undulations developed in areas where Snail was expressed, and proliferative markers persisted in these regions ( Figure 3I and 3J; anti - cyclin D staining).	"Snail	76	81	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

In contrast, Snail expression was not induced by these conditions ( Figure 5A).	"Snail	13	18	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

Different genetic backgrounds have been shown to modify the growth - enhancing effects of hg [ 15, 22].	"genetic	10	17	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""genetic"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
As an initial step, growth and carcass composition QTL were identified in a cross between CAST / EiJ ( CAST) and HG [ 24].	"QTL	51	54	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""QTL"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
In the current study we have developed speed congenic strains to isolate all the aforementioned QTL.	"QTL	96	99	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""QTL"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Two speed congenic panels were created, the first comprehensively dissected MMU2 while the second isolated QTL on MMU1, 5, 8, 9, 11 and 17 ( Table 1).	"QTL	107	110	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""QTL"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"

In addition to both congenic panels, two control strains homozygous B6 ( B6. CASTC; B6C) or HG ( HG.

Both sexes had reductions in weight at 2 ( 2WK), 3 ( 3WK), 6 ( 6WK) and 9 ( 9WK) weeks of age compared to control B6C mice ( Figure 3).	"mice	118	122	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

In contrast, B62M mice displayed small decreases in body weights and growth ( male 9WK was significant, female 6WK and 9WK were suggestive at P < 0. 05) and significant decreases in NA ( male P = 0. 0152) and tail length ( Additional File 3 and Table 2).

However, since numerous obesity QTL have been found on MMU2 [ 2], some of which were discovered in B6 by CAST crosses [ 9, 25], we chose to measure dissected fat pad weights as a more sensitive measure of adiposity.

Interestingly, no difference in adiposity was seen in B62M mice.	"mice	59	63	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
HG2P and HG2PM mice of both sexes displayed significant decreases in post - weaning body weights and growth rates ( Additional Table 3).	"mice	15	19	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

In support of the sex - specific QTL effects strain by sex interactions ( P < 0. 04) were seen for the following growth traits: 3WK, 6WK, 9WK, G26, G29 and NA ( data not shown).	"QTL	33	36	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""QTL"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
The phenotypic correlation between carcass fat ( FAT) as a percent of the empty carcass weight ( ECW; weight of total body ( including organs) minus the head and gastrointestinal tract) (% FAT) determined by chemical analysis and AI, using data from all three lines ( HGC, HG11 and HG17), was 0. 92.

However, the digit patterns of those animals are completely normal ( Figure 1I and 1Q).	"animals	37	44	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Nonetheless, the autopod elements are significantly reduced in size, and strikingly the two posterior - most digits are missing in the forelimbs of these animals.	"animals	154	161	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

In Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre limbs, only the very distal tips of each digit were separated, with the autopod adopting the shape of a notched pallet ( Figure 2F).

BMP signaling has been proposed to play several distinct roles in limb patterning.	"BMP	0	3	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
While a distal phalanx was lost from the middle digit of the forelimbs of these animals, these digits do not otherwise have a morphology consistent with their being transformed anteriorly into digit 1 ( thumb).	"animals	80	87	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

The expansion of the AER in the absence of BMP signaling may be understood on the basis of the feedback loop between the zone of polarizing activity ( ZPA) and the AER.	"BMP	43	46	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, a decrease in BMP signaling expands and maintains the AER.	"BMP	20	23	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

Osteoprogenitor cells from bone collar region now populate this site and deposit osteoid, forming the trabecular bone in the bone marrow cavity ( Figure 6E, red arrow) and cortical bone at birth ( Figure 5I, asterisk).

Many osteoclasts have been recruited to the remaining mineralized cartilage and are actively resorbing this tissue ( red asterisks, Figure 6I), so that by 3 wks, all the mineralized cartilage in the diaphyseal region has disappeared, leaving a void where bone formation should have occurred ( Figure 6J, also see Figures 6L and S3).

BMP Signaling and Pattern Formation	"BMP	0	3	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
It has been proposed that BMP signaling may be involved in digit patterning as a secondary signal originating in the ZPA [ 7, 11, 43] or as a later mediator of interdigital patterning information [ 15].	"BMP	26	29	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, inactivation of Bmp2 during early limb bud development clearly does not cause any digit patterning defects.	"Bmp2	25	29	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Bmp2"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
BMPs are known, in many cases, to function redundantly [ 44].	"BMPs	0	4	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMPs"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Our data implicate BMP signaling in this process.	"BMP	19	22	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
At later stages, BMP signaling has been suggested to play a role in mediating the transfer of positional information from the interdigital mesenchyme to specify the identity of the adjacent digits [ 15].	"BMP	17	20	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Decreasing the level of interdigital BMP signaling, without abolishing it, provides an opportunity for differentiating between these models.	"BMP	37	40	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
If BMP signaling were only required as a permissive factor for chondrogenesis, partial reduction in the level of signaling might have no effect.	"BMP	3	6	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 6, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, we conclude that BMP signaling is not likely to be responsible in a quantitative fashion for the instructive role of interdigital mesenchyme in establishing digit identities.	"BMP	23	26	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, if the conditional alleles were partially recombined at early stages and only completely recombined at later stages, it is the distal elements, formed after greater recombination has taken place, that should be more severely affected.
