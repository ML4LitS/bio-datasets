In 5 and 54 wk old alphaA / BKO lenses, superficial and deep anterior cortical regions, stained for lipid membranes, did not reveal any patterns typical of fiber cells cut in cross - section or longitudinal section.

In the equatorial / bow region, a disorganized array of relatively small irregular shaped cells were observed in 5 wk ( Figure 4A) and 54 wk ( Figure 4D) alphaA / BKO lenses, while elongated fiber cells organized into radial columns, with ball and socket interdigitations, were observed in 5 wk ( Figure 4G), 46 wk ( Figure 4J) and 72 wk ( data not shown) wild type lenses.

In the 5 wk alphaA / BKO lenses, nucleic acid staining in the posterior subcapsular region is consistent with either anterior epithelial cells migrating aberrantly to the posterior pole, or primary fiber cells failing to fully differentiate by 5 wks of age.

The morphological differences in alphaA / BKO lenses, compared to age matched wild type lenses, were consistent with the hypothesis that alpha - crystallin plays an active role in the differentiation and growth of lens fiber cells.

A subset of immortalized lens epithelial cells from alphaBKO mice have been shown to hyperproliferate [ 20] suggesting that alphaB may be important in maintaining genomic stability.

In lens epithelium derived from alphaAKO lenses, cell growth rates were reported to be 50% lower compared to wild type [ 31], suggesting a role for alphaA in regulating the cell cycle.

Tripeptidyl - peptidase I, also known as CLN2, is a member of the family of sedolisins ( serine - carboxyl peptidases).

We have analyzed the presence of orthologs of human CLN2 in the genomic sequences of a number of eukaryotic species.

It was also demonstrated that mutations leading to abolishment of the enzymatic activity of CLN2 were the direct cause of a fatal inherited neurodegenerative disease, classical late - infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis [ 2].	"mutations	30	39	Sequence"	"enzymatic	70	79	Sequence"	"CLN2	92	96	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"neuronal	194	202	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""mutations"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""enzymatic"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""CLN2"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 194, ""end_span"": 202, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
These enzymes are expressed with a prosegment consisting of 195 residues that is cleaved off during maturation, yielding the active catalytic domain.

However, the sequenced part of the enzyme shows 75% identity with the fugu sedolisin - TPP, and 69% identity with human CLN2 ( Figure 3).

It is thus likely that pseudo - iodotyrostatin or a similar inhibitor might work for CLN2 as well, although the actual contacts between the inhibitor and the enzyme that are seen in the model have to be treated with caution.

The right - hand side of the pocket ( in the view used in Figure 6) is made of the main chain including residues 164 - 165 ( unless otherwise indicated, the numbering refers to the sequence of the mature human CLN2).

This part of the main chain is held in place through a hydrogen - bonded interaction with the side chain of Thr279, part of the signature sequence SGTSAS surrounding the catalytic Ser280 and its equivalents in the other enzymes.

The equivalent residue in CLN2 is Thr182, but it is very unlikely that it can assume an orientation that would allow it to make a hydrogen bond to a P1 tyrosine.

Tyr130, an equivalent of the latter residue in CLN2, is unlikely to come into direct contact with the P2 residue of the substrate due to its greater distance ( almost 4 A for the closest atoms).

However, this latter interaction is not likely to be structurally crucial since the serine is not absolutely conserved in all CLN2 - like enzymes.

Various defects that include truncations and single - site mutations in CLN2 have been found in the genes of patients that display symptoms of late - infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis [ 17].

CLN2 is capable of processing a number of different angiotensin - derived peptides [ 19], with the efficiency of cleavage dependent on the length of such peptides.

As is expected for a family of proteins, highly - conserved segments were found aligned to the crystal structure - identified core regions of the sedolisin and kumamolisin sequences.

Finally, some additional adjustment was required to correct the few places where highly conserved residues of the core regions were slightly out of alignment among different subfamilies of sequences.

With the correspondence of residues specified in the alignments, atomic coordinates were transferred to the target sequence by a variety of methods, including the homology modeling modules of the Look / GeneMine [ 29] and DeepView [ 30] computer program packages.

A similar two - step approach was used to manifest the insertions and deletions in the variable, loop regions of the protein, where it was necessary to create new backbone as well as side chain coordinates for the models.

During development, hematopoietic progenitor cells in mon mutants fail to express normal levels of hematopoietic transcription factors, including gata1, and undergo apoptosis.

Surprisingly, a high level of zygotic tif1 gamma mRNA expression delineates ventral mesoderm during hematopoietic stem cell and progenitor formation prior to gata1 expression.

Here, we have determined that mutations in the mon gene cause a disruption in both primitive embryonic and definitive adult hematopoiesis, resulting in a severe loss of erythroid cells.

TIF1 alpha has been shown to associate with a variety of ligand - bound nuclear hormone receptors ( Le Douarin et al. 1995) and function as a coactivator for retinoic acid receptors ( Zhong et al. 1999).

The tif1 gamma gene is expressed specifically in ventral mesoderm and hematopoietic progenitors, then downregulated as erythroid maturation occurs.

During embryogenesis, homozygous zebrafish mon mutants have no red blood cells ( RBCs) visible in circulation ( Ransom et al. 1996; Weinstein et al. 1996).

By 18 - 22 hpf, hematopoietic - specific markers such as gata1, scl, gata2, and ikaros are not detected in the embryonic blood island ( Figure 1A and 1B; unpublished data).

The hematopoietic cells are thus correctly specified early during the development of mon mutant embryos, but these precursors undergo cell death.

The mon gene is thus required for normal development and survival of both committed erythroid progenitor cells and posterior mesenchymal cells.

In wild - type zebrafish, the adult site of hematopoiesis is the kidney ( Al Adhami and Kunz 1977), which contains erythroid, lymphoid, and myeloid populations at various stages of differentiation ( Bennett et al. 2001).

In mon homozygous mutants, there is a severe block in maturation at the proerythroblast stage ( Figure 2), whereas the differentiation of myeloid cells is normal ( unpublished data).

The marker 80M12 - T7 maps two recombinants out of 4, 400 meioses telomeric of the mutation, and the marker 157J23 - T7 maps one recombinant centromic of the mutation ( Figure 3A).

In contrast, the monm262 allele has 10 - 100 circulating blood cells by 48 hpf, in comparison to the approximately 3, 000 RBCs in the circulation of wild - type or heterozygous embryos at the same time point.

Homozygous montg234 mutants have a greatly reduced amount of tif1 gamma mRNA in all tissues consistent with nonsense - mediated message decay.

Thus, zebrafish tif1 gamma is specifically expressed in ventral mesoderm and putative hemangioblasts prior to and during the embryonic stages when hematopoietic progenitors are undergoing apoptosis in mon mutants.

Using zebrafish expressed sequence tag ( EST) sequences, we designed primers to RT - PCR amplify a TIF1 - related cDNA from embryonic 10 - hpf and 24 - hpf RNA.

Therefore, the results of cell transplantations suggests that tif1 gamma plays a cell - autonomous role in erythroid cells, and its role in nonhematopoietic tissues, such as trunk mesenchyme or the nervous system, is also required for embryo survival.	"cell	26	30	Cell"	"tif1 gamma	62	72	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cell	81	85	Cell"	"erythroid cells	107	122	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""tif1 gamma"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""erythroid cells"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Positional cloning was used to identify the mon gene, establishing a critical role for a transcriptional intermediary factor, Tif1 gamma, during hematopoietic development.

The expression of gata1 appears to initiate normally in the committed erythroid cells of mon mutants.

Maternally expressed zebrafish Tif1 gamma may play roles in hematopoiesis or other aspects of organogenesis that are not detectable due to the presence of wild - type mRNA in eggs laid by heterozygous mothers.

Analysis of the offspring of homozygous mon mutant female zebrafish will aid in defining the function of this maternal mRNA.

We also tested for a direct interaction between Tif1 gamma and Gata1 proteins by coimmunoprecipitation and yeast two - hybrid assays and found no association ( unpublished data).

Taken together, our data suggest that tif1 gamma is required as a permissive cofactor for the erythroid lineage - specific control of hematopoietic gene expression.

Tif1 gamma is detected within nuclear foci ( see Figure 6), which, based on our analysis, do not appear to correspond to several types of previously described nuclear bodies, including PML bodies.	"Tif1 gamma	0	10	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"nuclear	30	37	GO_ontology"	"nuclear bodies	159	173	GO_ontology"	"PML bodies	185	195	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Tif1 gamma"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""nuclear bodies"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""PML bodies"", ""start_span"": 185, ""end_span"": 195, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Localization of Tif1 gamma to these nuclear bodies may be regulated by posttranslational modification such as SUMO modification that is required for PML to form PML nuclear domains ( Zhong et al. 2000a, 2000b; Best et al. 2002).

These findings, taken together, indicated that the phenotype associated with Apcs deficiency was caused by the presence of unaltered 129 genes from the telomeric region of Chromosome 1 operating in the C57BL / 6 genomic background.

The phosphatidylserine receptor ( Ptdsr) on phagocytes has been implicated in the recognition and engulfment of apoptotic cells and in anti - inflammatory signaling.

To determine the biological function of the phosphatidylserine receptor in vivo, we inactivated the Ptdsr gene in the mouse.

Moreover, Ptdsr is not required for apoptotic cell clearance by macrophages but seems to be necessary for the regulation of macrophage cytokine responses.

Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is required for the normal development of almost all multicellular organisms and is a physiological mechanism for controlling cell number; as a result, structures that are no longer needed are deleted during development and abnormal cells are eliminated [ 1, 2].

Apoptotic cells are removed rapidly and efficiently as intact cells or apoptotic bodies by professional phagocytes or by neighboring cells.

Detailed genetic studies in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans have recently yielded evidence that basic phagocytic mechanisms and pathways for the recognition and engulfment of apoptotic cells are highly conserved throughout phylogeny [ 7, 8].	"genetic	9	16	Sequence"	"Drosophila	28	38	Organism"	"Caenorhabditis elegans	43	65	Organism"	"apoptotic cells	181	196	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""genetic"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Caenorhabditis elegans"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 181, ""end_span"": 196, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The importance of efficient mechanisms for apoptotic cell clearance in vivo is supported by the observation that autoimmune responses can be provoked in mice when key molecules for apoptotic cell recognition and uptake are missing.	"apoptotic cell	43	57	Cell"	"mice	153	157	Organism"	"molecules	167	176	Chemical"	"apoptotic cell	181	195	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""apoptotic cell"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""molecules"", ""start_span"": 167, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cell"", ""start_span"": 181, ""end_span"": 195, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
A number of cell - surface and bridging molecules can interact with exposed PS on apoptotic cells.

The best - characterized molecule so far that binds PS in a stereo - specific manner is the phosphatidylserine receptor ( Ptdsr) [ 26].	"molecule	25	33	Chemical"	"PS	52	54	Chemical"	"phosphatidylserine receptor	92	119	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Ptdsr	122	127	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""molecule"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""PS"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""phosphatidylserine receptor"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
These data supported the hypothesis that Ptdsr fulfils a role as a crucial signaling switch after the engagement of macrophages with apoptotic cells and is thereby fundamental for preventing local immune responses to apoptotic cells before their clearance [ 28].

Moreover, an additional study performed recently in Hydra showed an exclusively nuclear localization for the Ptdsr protein [ 30].

To examine further the role of Ptdsr in vivo, we performed gene - expression and gene - targeting studies in mice.

Analysis by RT - PCR ( data not shown) showed that Ptdsr is expressed early in development, because we were able to detect Ptdsr transcripts in ES cells and embryos at all developmental stages.

Kidneys from Ptdsr + / + embryos were well developed at E16. 5, showing terminally differentiated glomeruli with Bowman ' s capsule and collecting tubules lined with cuboidal epithelial cells ( Figure 3b).

Close examination of retinal structures revealed that the inner granular layer was still less expanded in Ptdsr - deficient animals, however, and that it contained fewer cells and was still severely underdeveloped in comparison with the corresponding retinal layer in control animals ( Figure 4c, 4g and 4d, 4h).

Starting at E12. 5, we analyzed and compared the number and distribution of aCasp3 - positive cells in over 140 serial sections of three wild - type and six Ptdsr - / - embryos in consecutive and corresponding sections.

Furthermore, when we continued our analysis of apoptotic cell clearance in vivo at E16. 5, E17. 5 and E18. 5 of embryonic development as well as in neonatal mice, the number and distribution of apoptotic cells was similar in both genotypes.	"apoptotic cell	47	61	Cell"	"mice	157	161	Organism"	"apoptotic cells	194	209	Cell"	"genotypes	230	239	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""apoptotic cell"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 194, ""end_span"": 209, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""genotypes"", ""start_span"": 230, ""end_span"": 239, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
As already observed at E12. 5, analysis of aCasp3 - stained sections of the developing thymus, heart, diaphragm, genital ridge, eyes and retina convincingly showed that there was no impairment in apoptotic cell removal in Ptdsr - / - mice.	"aCasp3	43	49	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"apoptotic cell	196	210	Cell"	"Ptdsr	222	227	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	234	238	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""aCasp3"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cell"", ""start_span"": 196, ""end_span"": 210, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 222, ""end_span"": 227, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 234, ""end_span"": 238, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In summary, our analysis in vivo did not reveal any impairment in apoptotic cell clearance in Ptdsr - deficient embryos during development and further suggests that phagocytosis of apoptotic cells is mainly mediated by non - professional ' bystander ' cells.	"apoptotic cell	66	80	Cell"	"Ptdsr	94	99	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"apoptotic cells	181	196	Cell"	"cells	252	257	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""apoptotic cell"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 181, ""end_span"": 196, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 252, ""end_span"": 257, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Again, no differences were found in the percentage of macrophages that had engulfed apoptotic cells ( Figure 7a, c, e) or in the relative number of phagocytosed apoptotic cells per macrophage ( phagocytotic index; Figure 7f).	"macrophages	54	65	Cell"	"apoptotic cells	84	99	Cell"	"apoptotic cells	161	176	Cell"	"macrophage	181	191	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 161, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""macrophage"", ""start_span"": 181, ""end_span"": 191, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In addition to its suggested importance for phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, it has been proposed that Ptdsr fulfils a second crucial role in regulating and maintaining a non - inflammatory environment upon the recognition of apoptotic cells by macrophages [ 26].

Instead, increased expression of Col10a1 was seen in a zone of largely LACZ - negative cells stretching from the cartilage adjacent to the ossification front ( where Col10a1 is normally expressed in maturing cartilage cells), toward the regions where surface articular cartilage was severely eroded or missing ( Figure 6A and 6B, arrowheads).

As previously seen in 1 - and 2 - wk - old animals, Safranin O staining and Agg and Col10 expression were all reduced in mutant articular regions of the forefeet and hindfeet by 7 wk of age, and the beginning signs of cartilage loss were observed ( unpublished data).

The lack of joint fusions outside the ankle region could be due to differences in requirement for BMP signaling in different joints, to compensating expression of other BMP receptors outside the ankles, or to differences in the detailed timing of Gdf5 - Cre stimulated gene inactivation in ankles and other joint regions.

Comparison of the expression of the HPLAP marker ( driven directly by Gdf5 control elements) and the R26R LACZ marker ( expressed following Gdf5 - Cre recombination) suggests that recombination - stimulated changes in gene expression may be delayed for a 0. 5 - 1 d in the digit region ( see Figure 1C).

In our experiments, articular cartilage lacking Bmpr1a retains some normal characteristics, in that it maintains a very low proliferation rate, does not express Col1a1, and continues to express SOX9, a major transcription factor regulating expression of structural components of cartilage matrix.

Although we have tried to monitor the expression of L - Sox5 or Sox6 in postnatal articular cartilage, and test the phosphorylation state of SOX9 using previously described reagents ( Lefebvre et al. 1998; Huang et al. 2000), we have been unable to obtain specific signal at the late postnatal stages required ( unpublished data).

In the adult spinal cord, while motor neurons express high levels of NT - 3, other cells, including glia, also express it ( Zhou and Rush 1994; Dreyfus et al. 1999; Buck et al. 2000).

NT - 3 is capable of attracting axons along distances of up to 1 mm in collagen gel matrix, covering the physiological range it needs to attract axons during development.

Previous studies with exogenous or local applications of NT - 3 to developing primary sensory axons have indicated that this neurotrophin can attract and induce axonal branching ( Ulup i nar et al. 2000; O zdinler and Erzurumlu 2001, O zdinler et al. 2004).

Another molecule, Slit2, expressed in the midline and by motor neurons ( Wang et al. 1999) is capable of inducing axonal branching ( Nguyen Ba - Charvet et al. 2001; O zdinler and Erzurumlu 2002).

Slit2 does not cause repulsion of NT - 3 - responsive DRG axons in vitro ( Nguyen Ba - Charvet et al. 2001), but causes ectopic branching and arborization of trigeminal axons in the brainstem ( O zdinler and Erzurumlu 2002).

Our present results suggest that NT - 3 acts as a short - range axon guidance cue for proprioceptive axons centrally and peripherally, as they navigate to their targets using other axon guidance cues.

On a bubble substrate, Mcm4 / 6 / 7 makes symmetric dual contacts with the 5 ' - proximal 25 nt single - stranded segments adjacent to the branch points, presumably generating double hexamers.

Loss of thymine residues from one single - strand results in significant decrease of unwinding efficacy, suggesting that concurrent bidirectional unwinding by a single double hexameric Mcm4 / 6 / 7 may play a role in efficient unwinding of the bubble.

This DUE is believed to coincide with the initially unwound region of the c - myc origin ( 29), and its deletion substantially reduced the replicator activity ( 30).

In gel shift assays, MCM4 / 6 / 7 bound to all the three bubbles, although the affinity to Bub82 / c - myc / DUE and to Bub82 / c - myc / DUE - C is slightly lower than that to Bub - 82 / lamin B2 ( Figure 7B).

This was also indicated by our previous results that guanine and cytosine stretches can bind to Mcm but cannot activate the helicase ( 13).

Our results indicate that thymine - rich single - stranded DNA is required for initial loading and activation of the Mcm helicase.

In gel shift assays, Mcm4 / 6 / 7 bound to these Y - fork substrates with identical affinity ( Figure 8A), consistent with the notion that the Mcm4 / 6 / 7 binds to single - stranded tails.

However, in DNA helicase assays, T - fork / ( C: G) 49 was hardly displaced by Mcm4 / 6 / 7, but was readily displaced by SV40 T - antigen DNA helicase ( Figure 8B).

We found that the Mcm4 / 6 / 7 helicase can displace duplex DNA up to 350 nt long on its own on the former substrate ( Figure 8D, left), consistent with previous results ( 13).

In contrast, displacement was inhibited over the GC - rich segments on the latter substrate ( Figure 8D, right panel), although displacement up to 250 nt in length, albeit at a reduced level, was observed at a high concentration of Mcm4 / 6 / 7 complex.

Mcm4 / 6 / 7 hardly displaced the 31 nt long duplex of GCC: CGG repeats, whereas the T - fork / ( GAA: CTT) 10 was displaced efficiently, as described above.

The ability of the mouse Mcm4 / 6 / 7 to unwind 3 ' - extension is shared by the archaeal Mcm helicase but not by Mcm4 / 6 / 7 from S. pombe and S. cerevisiae ( 14, 26, 27).

Both lamin - B2 and c - myc origins served as efficient activator for Mcm helicase in vitro.

We propose that, only when both hexamers are activated by the interacting thymine - rich sequences present within the melted region, the Mcm helicase is mobilized and initiation takes place.

It may also require association of fork - assisting proteins such as Cdc45 ( 37, 38) as well as phosphorylation events by Cdk and Cdc7 kinases ( 39, 40).

This, in conjunction with the low processivity of Mcm4 / 6 / 7 helicase, strongly indicates that the replicative helicase at the replication forks would require more than Mcm4 / 6 / 7 complex.

Whole mount and section insitu hybridizations of E7. 5 embryos shows T ( Brachyury) ( A - D) is expressed in the primitive streak, node, axial mesoderm and Evx1 ( E - F) is expressed in the primitive streak, most strongly in the proximal streak wild - type embryos.

Analysis of paraxial mesoderm markers Tbx6 ( I, J) and Dll1 ( K, L), reveals that these markers are reduced in mutant embryos ( J, L), suggesting impaired paraxial mesoderm production in the absence of huntingtin.

In contrast to wild - type embryos, which exhibit tight restriction of Nodal. LacZ expression to the node, Hdhex4 / 5 / Hdhex4 / 5: Ndllacz / Ndl + embryos express Nodal. LacZ throughout the endoderm overlying the epiblast, with higher levels in the posterior in an asymmetric pattern ( Fig. 3A - D).

These results suggest that, in contrast to proper Hnf3 beta regulation, Gsc remains inappropriately activated in mutant visceral and definitive endoderm, implicating huntingtin in the proper restriction of this homeodomain transcription factor.

Hnf4 is a transcription factor expressed in the primitive endoderm as soon as this tissue becomes distinct and is a key regulator of visceral endoderm secreted factors such as alphafetoprotein, apolipoproteins, and transferrin.

Primitive germ cells ( PCGs) are induced normally in both wild - type ( G) and mutant embryos ( H), suggesting the Bmp4 signaling from the extraembryonic ectoderm to the epiblast is normal.	"Primitive germ cells ( PCGs	0	27	Cell"	"wild - type	58	69	Sequence"	"mutant	79	85	Sequence"	"Bmp4	115	119	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Primitive germ cells ( PCGs"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""wild - type"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Bmp4"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Furthermore, the expression of T and Evx1 in the extraembryonic mesoderm of mutant embryos is not a feature of wild - type embryos, even at earlier stages.	"T	31	32	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Evx1	37	41	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutant	76	82	Sequence"	"wild - type	111	122	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""T"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Evx1"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""wild - type"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
This impairment may also explain the failure of huntingtin deficient embryos to properly restrict the expression of Fgf8, Nodal and Gsc.	"huntingtin	48	58	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Fgf8	116	120	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Nodal	122	127	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Gsc	132	135	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""huntingtin"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Fgf8"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Nodal"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Gsc"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, huntingtin may play a direct role in the transcriptional regulation, or mRNA stability of these genes or it may act indirectly by intersecting with other pathways that regulate the expression of these genes.

Moreover, extraembryonic Bmp4 signaling is not impaired in the absence of huntingtin, as the induction of PCGs in mutant embryos is normal, implying proper transport and secretion of the appropriate extraembryonic signals.

Cells expressing AQP2 - F204V lacked the 35 - 45 kDa form and were enriched in the core - glycosylated 31 kDa form.

In transfected, unstimulated MDCK cells, wild - type AQP2 ( stained green) appeared in a punctate pattern distributed throughout the subapical region ( Figure 4B, left column photomicrographs), consistent with vesicular compartmentalization.	"cells	34	39	Cell"	"wild - type	41	52	Sequence"	"AQP2	53	57	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"vesicular	210	219	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""wild - type"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""AQP2"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""vesicular"", ""start_span"": 210, ""end_span"": 219, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Alternatively, the presence of wild - type protein may alter the localization of the mutant protein.	"wild - type	31	42	Sequence"	"protein	43	50	Chemical"	"mutant	85	91	Sequence"	"protein	92	99	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""wild - type"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
To test this idea, we first looked for an interaction between mutant and wild - type proteins in transfected MDCK cells ( Figure 5B).	"mutant	62	68	Sequence"	"wild - type	73	84	Sequence"	"proteins	85	93	Chemical"	"cells	114	119	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""wild - type"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""proteins"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
AQP2 - F204V - GFP, when expressed by transient transfection into vector only cells, showed a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution pattern ( Figure 5C, lower left).	"AQP2	0	4	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"vector	66	72	Sequence"	"cells	78	83	Cell"	"cytoplasmic	102	113	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""AQP2"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""vector"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cytoplasmic"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
The first is a nontransfected cell that shows the localization of the stably expressing wild - type AQP2, which is apical upon forskolin stimulation.	"cell	30	34	Cell"	"wild - type	88	99	Sequence"	"AQP2	100	104	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"apical	115	121	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""wild - type"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""AQP2"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""apical"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Although the effect was subtle in cell ( iii), AQP2 - F204V - GFP was partly localized to the apical surface.	"cell	34	38	Cell"	"AQP2	47	51	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"apical	94	100	GO_ontology"	"surface	101	108	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""AQP2"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""apical"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""surface"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Generally, the localization of AQP2 - F204V - GFP was clearly more apical when wild - type AQP2 was also expressed.	"AQP2	31	35	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"apical	67	73	GO_ontology"	"wild - type	79	90	Sequence"	"AQP2	91	95	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""AQP2"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""apical"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""wild - type"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""AQP2"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In humans, NDI is caused by mutations in Avpr2 or Aqp2.	"humans	3	9	Organism"	"mutations	28	37	Sequence"	"Avpr2	41	46	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Aqp2	50	54	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""humans"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mutations"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Avpr2"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Aqp2"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Immunostaining of kidney shows that AQP2 - F204V does not efficiently transport water, because it fails to localize to the apical cell surface after dDAVP treatment.	"AQP2	36	40	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"water	80	85	Chemical"	"apical	123	129	GO_ontology"	"cell surface	130	142	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""AQP2"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""water"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""apical"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""cell surface"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Some residual activity of AQP2 would imply that some small, undetectable portion of the mutant protein is getting to the cell surface.	"AQP2	26	30	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutant	88	94	Sequence"	"protein	95	102	Chemical"	"cell surface	121	133	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""AQP2"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""cell surface"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
The surface biotinylation experiment ( Figure 5D) suggests that no mutant protein gets to the surface, but this does not necessarily reflect the situation in vivo.	"surface	4	11	GO_ontology"	"mutant	67	73	Sequence"	"protein	74	81	Chemical"	"surface	94	101	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""surface"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""surface"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
The presence of a reduced but detectable amount of protein in the 35 - 45 kDa range indicates that mutant protein is transported out of the ER, but with greatly reduced efficiency.	"protein	51	58	Chemical"	"mutant	99	105	Sequence"	"protein	106	113	Chemical"	"ER	140	142	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""ER"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Reduced efficiency in exiting the ER may explain why AQP2 - F204V is enriched in the 31 kDa high - mannose glycosylated form.	"ER	34	36	GO_ontology"	"AQP2	53	57	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mannose	99	106	Chemical"	"form	120	124	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""ER"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""AQP2"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mannose"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""form"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
While improper localization of AQP2 explains the phenotype of homozygous mutant mice, the complete lack of a phenotype in heterozygous mice is more difficult to explain.	"AQP2	31	35	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutant	73	79	Sequence"	"mice	80	84	Organism"	"mice	135	139	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""AQP2"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This mouse model of NDI based on an Aqp2 allele that can be rescued provides the opportunity to test therapies, including gene therapy, that may promote proper subcellular localization.

In fact, the most likely candidates for a cellular correlate of olfactory memory appear to be the neuronal connections in the piriform cortex due to the associational connectivity [ 5] and the expression of several forms of cellular and synaptic plasticity [ 7, 20 - 23].

Thus, the absence of GluR - B, or the expression of GluR - B ( Q) in the olfactory bulb, may generate increased inhibition in mitral cells.

In addition, in contrast to the complete GluR - B knockouts, mice with forebrain - specific GluR - B depletion appeared normal throughout life with no developmental abnormalities, or difference in body size and weight in adulthood ( wild - type: 31. 0 g +/- 1. 2; GluR - B Delta FB: 28. 4 +/- 0. 9; each n = 10).

As this variability persisted after several backcrosses, and Southern blot analysis revealed no differences of transgene integration or number among animals ( Figure 3B), it could not be attributed to genetic differences but rather to epigenetic mechanisms.

To quantify the relation between residual GluR - B protein and olfactory memory, the memory experiment was repeated with nine additional GluR - B Delta FB mice and two GluR - B2lox control animals ( indicated with shaded symbols in Figure 4A), resulting in the same mean, variability, and range of memory performance ( control: 89 +/- 10%; GluR - B Delta FB: 63 +/- 14%).

This was rather pronounced for GluR - B ( Q) - expressing mice, consistent with the overall stronger phenotypic consequences in comparison to GluR - B depletion, both when forebrain - selective ( [ 58], and this study) or global [ 53, 60].

In addition, in hippocampal and amygdala pathways lacking GluR - B, an AMPAR - dependent, N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA) receptor - independent form of LTP can be readily induced [ 51, 52].

The 2% SDS extracts were diluted in EC buffer, and the FA extracts neutralized with 1M Tris - phosphate buffer ( pH 11) then diluted with EC buffer prior to testing.

Total A beta ( mouse + human; 1 - to 1. 5 - mo samples only) was measured in each fraction using BNT77 for capture ( epitope A beta 11 - 28) and BA27 and BC05 for detection.

Importantly, the total amount of APP ( endogenous plus transgenic) and related APLPs in both acute and chronically treated animals was statistically indistinguishable from that in nontransgenic mice ( Figure 1D; statistical analyses for experiments throughout the study are presented in the accompanying figure legends).

To further ensure we could detect any such insoluble aggregates that might bias our measure of changes in peptide synthesis, we performed a sequential three - step extraction with PBS, 2% SDS, and 70% FA that would separate peptides by solubility.

Only the FA fraction revealed a small dox - resistant pool of peptide in acutely treated animals that we believe represents stable predeposit aggregates that have already accumulated by 4 wk of age when treatment was begun ( Figure 2C).

Indeed, animals that were born and raised on dox did not harbor this reservoir of treatment - resistant peptide, with 96. 3% less A beta 42 than untreated 4 - wk - old mice.

Taken together with the immunoblotting data for full - length APPswe / ind, the ELISA measurements indicate that dox - mediated suppression of transgenic APPswe / ind synthesis leads to parallel reduction of A beta levels.

Histological characterization of double transgenic ( CaMKII alpha - tTA x tet - APPswe / ind) mice revealed early - onset amyloid formation in all four new lines.

The presence of amyloid pathology in this region has been attributed to axonal transport of APP / A beta to the terminals of cortical neurons in the thalamus [ 29].

Most importantly, only double transgenic mice, expressing both the tTA and APP transgenes, developed amyloid lesions.

Animals from our highest expressing line ( line 885) maintained on dox for up to 1 y harbored no amyloid pathology ( data not shown), indicating that residual leakage of transgene expression in the presence of dox does not provide sufficient A beta peptide to induce amyloid formation even over long periods.

To ensure that the transgene could be suppressed as rapidly in 6 - mo - old mice with fulminant pathology as it can in young, predeposit animals, we treated an additional set of 6 - mo - old animals with dox for 1 wk prior to harvest.

Tissue sections from each animal in the four treatment groups were stained for amyloid pathology by Hirano silver, Campbell - Switzer silver, thioflavin - S, and A beta immunohistochemistry.

We biochemically measured the amount of aggregated A beta in the brains of our mice before and after transgene suppression using filter trap analysis of cortical tissue from each animal.

The tTA / APP animals were often seen running in circles around the perimeter of their cages, and a similar swimming pattern was noted when the mice were tested in the Morris water maze.

Transgenic expression of APPswe / ind and consequent overproduction of A beta 42 cause early - onset amyloid deposition in untreated mice, in which deposits appear as early as 2 mo of age.	"Transgenic	0	10	Sequence"	"ind	34	37	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"A beta 42	71	80	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	133	137	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Transgenic"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""ind"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""A beta 42"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This latter finding indicates that compared to other disease - associated protein aggregates such as mutant huntingtin, which clear in less than 3 mo [ 32], the disaggregation of extracellular amyloid is relatively slow.	"protein	74	81	Chemical"	"mutant	101	107	Sequence"	"huntingtin	108	118	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"extracellular	179	192	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""huntingtin"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""extracellular"", ""start_span"": 179, ""end_span"": 192, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Thus, even after accounting for the much higher APP expression levels in our mice than in the Tg2576 and TgCRND8 lines, we have achieved better absolute suppression of A beta production with the tet - off system than is currently possible with published gamma - secretase inhibitors.

Since even the most advanced future pharmaceutical agents are unlikely to attain more complete control of A beta production than achieved here, this system provides a salient test of therapeutic intervention with A beta - lowering compounds.

It is possible that the combined low levels of endogenous mouse A beta and nonsuppressed human peptide are sufficient to maintain existing deposits.

However, these low levels of peptide are not sufficient to induce new amyloid formation, as CaMKII alpha - tTA x tetAPPswe / ind mice raised on dox for up to a year do not develop amyloid lesions ( data not shown).

But in the case of acute antibody - and / or injury - mediated activation, once the inflammation has passed, and the antibody and bound peptide have been cleared and degraded, the remaining A beta quickly reaggregates and amyloid pathology is reestablished [ 49].

As in our tet - off APP mice, SantaCruz et al. found that tau neurofibrillary tangles, like amyloid plaques, are not cleared efficiently following transgene suppression.

Perhaps once aggregated, A beta and tau are either inherently more stable than other protein aggregates or more resistant to intra - and extracellular clearance mechanisms.

A total of 334 F2 mice were genotyped at an average 1. 5 cM density using 1, 032 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) spanning all 19 autosomes.

This is noteworthy because hierarchical clustering of these transcripts against the 312 F2 mice shows an almost perfect clustering into male and female subgroups, emphasizing striking effects of sex on liver gene expression levels and suggesting that sex is controlling more variance in these transcripts ' expression than any other parameter.

At the threshold for significant linkage ( p < 5 x 10 - 5, genome - wide p < 0. 05, based on a single trait), the FDR was estimated at 3. 4% for the standard QTL model not accounting for any sex terms, 3. 1% for the QTL model accounting for additive sex effects, and 3. 2% for the QTL model accounting for additive sex effects and allowing for the sex interaction terms to enter the model.

Twenty - nine trans - eQTLs colocalize to Chromosome 9 at 40 cM, suggesting that 29 genes correlated with gonadal fat mass are regulated in trans by a polymorphism at this position.

This locus corresponds to one of the four sex - biased cQTLs for gonadal fat mass reported in this study, and the significant sex specificity of both the cis and trans genetic regulation of liver genes correlated with fat mass supports the functional significance of this locus in this organ.

Rather, underlying genetic regulation of most transcripts is the result of interactions between trans loci and sex - specific factors ( e. g., hormones).

One shortcoming of this approach, however, is that candidate genes are limited to those whose transcript expression levels vary in association with a nearby polymorphism that differs between the parental strains -- in other words, genes with significant and detectable cis - eQTLs.

An examination of existing databases identified over 1, 300 SNPs that showed variation between the B6 and C3H strains, and a complete linkage map for all 19 autosomes was constructed using 1, 032 of these SNPs at an average density of 1. 5 cM.

To assess the transcriptional repressive activity of mr - s in cells of retinal origin, we performed similar experiments using human Y79 retinoblastoma cells.

Since mr - s does not contain obvious DNA binding motifs, we suppose that there is a sequence - specific transcription factor ( s) which interacts with mr - s.	"mr - s	6	12	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"DNA	38	41	Sequence"	"sequence	85	93	Sequence"	"mr - s	152	158	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""mr - s"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""DNA"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""sequence"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""mr - s"", ""start_span"": 152, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This may support the idea that mr - s is involved in repressive complexes similar to other SAM domain - containing proteins.

In the present study, the biochemical experiments demonstrate that the mr - s protein functions as a transcriptional repressor and possibly down - regulates the spatial and temporal expression of the target genes during retinal photoreceptor development.

We hypothesize that the target genes of mr - s might be non - photoreceptor genes.

In this case, mr - s may suppress the expression of non - photoreceptor genes in rod and cone photoreceptors.

Homozygous lethality of the XPCS allele is likely due to reduced levels of expression of this essential protein as a result of gene targeting ( Figure 1A) rather than to the mutation itself.

Consistent with this interpretation, a different targeted Xpd mutation encoding XPDR683W, which is associated with XP in the homozygous state in humans, was similarly underexpressed and lethal in the homozygous state ( designated as + XP allele) ( Figure 1A - 1C; Table 1; unpublished data).

Whereas XpdTTD / TTD animals show reduced bone mineral density as an indication of the early onset of osteoporosis before ~ 14 mo of age [ 15], tail vertebrae from compound heterozygous XpdTTD / + XPCS mice were comparable to wt even at 20 mo of age ( Figure 3B and 3C).

We next turned to UV - based cellular assays including unscheduled DNA synthesis after UV irradiation ( UV - UDS), recovery of RNA synthesis after UV irradiation ( UV - RRS), and UV survival, which report on the NER subpathways ( global genome NER and transcription - coupled NER) and total NER, respectively.

However, unlike the in vivo TTD phenotypes described above, in which XpdTTD / TTD and XpdTTD / KO animals were indistinguishable, XpdTTD dosage effects were observed in UV survival, UV - UDS, and UV - RRS, indicating that cellular parameters as measured in fibroblasts here do not always correlate with the phenotype at the level of the intact organism.

During early embryonic development, XpdTTD is dominant over the Xpd + XPCS and Xpd + XP alleles, whereas later in the ontogenesis of skin, hair - shaft, and blood cells, the situation is reversed.

In its role in the repair of UV photolesions, the Xpd + XPCS allele imparted a clear UV survival benefit over a single XpdTTD allele or two XpdXPCS alleles independent of expression levels, which is consistent with interallelic complementation.

Pericentric heterochromatin, the major component of constitutive heterochromatin, can easily be visualized in interphase nuclei by the fluorochrome DAPI and by immunostaining with HP1 alpha [ 16, 17 - 19].

This result indicates that p150CAF - 1 is essential for nuclear organization of heterochromatin in ES cells in a similar way to early pre - implantation embryos.	"p150CAF - 1	27	38	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"nuclear	56	63	GO_ontology"	"heterochromatin	80	95	GO_ontology"	"cells	102	107	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""heterochromatin"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Surprisingly, we did not observe this severe alteration in heterochromatin organization in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs) following p150CAF - 1 depletion by RNAi.

Thus, CAF - 1 is specifically required in early embryos and in ES cells for the proper organization of the heterochromatin subnuclear compartment.

Altogether, our data demonstrate that loss of p150CAF - 1 function in ES cells and early embryos alters first the organization of heterochromatin in the nucleus and, in a subsequent step, cell cycle and viability.

In all conditions, the amount of histone H3 remaining associated with chromatin was indistinguishable in control and p150CAF - 1 - depleted ES cells ( unpublished data).

We first tested DNA CpG methylation [ 25] at major satellite repeats and found no significant difference between control and p150CAF - 1 - depleted cells ( Figure 6).

As the LTM7 ES cell line that we used in our RNAi experiments is a female ( XX) cell line, DNA methylation is globally reduced in these cells [ 26].

We next analyzed specific histone modifications [ 27] in chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP) experiments using native chromatin [ 28].

Similarly, CAF - 1 is essential in mammalian cell lines for the progression of DNA replication [ 16, 23, 24, 34].

Our findings reveal a role for CAF - 1 in the nuclear organization of heterochromatin domains during early development and in ES cells.

The role of CAF - 1 in the nuclear organization of heterochromatin includes spatial localization, condensation, and clustering of pericentric domains.	"CAF - 1	12	19	GO_ontology"	"nuclear	27	34	GO_ontology"	"heterochromatin	51	66	GO_ontology"	"pericentric domains	130	149	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""heterochromatin"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""pericentric domains"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
In ES cells, major architectural chromatin proteins are hyperdynamic and bind relatively loosely to chromatin [ 35].	"cells	6	11	Cell"	"chromatin	33	42	GO_ontology"	"proteins	43	51	Chemical"	"chromatin	100	109	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""chromatin"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""proteins"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""chromatin"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
In this cellular context, our findings show that proper heterochromatin nuclear architecture relies on CAF - 1 function.	"cellular	8	16	Cell"	"heterochromatin	56	71	GO_ontology"	"nuclear	72	79	GO_ontology"	"CAF - 1	103	110	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""cellular"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""heterochromatin"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
In contrast, in undifferentiated cells that are already lineage committed ( such as MEFs) genome architecture might be more stable than in ES cells and thus cannot be disrupted by CAF - 1 depletion.	"cells	33	38	Cell"	"genome	90	96	Sequence"	"cells	142	147	Cell"	"CAF - 1	180	187	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""genome"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 147, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 180, ""end_span"": 187, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Indeed, in Arabidopsis thaliana, in which CAF - 1 is not essential for viability [ 36], loss of CAF - 1 is associated with a mild alteration in chromocenter size [ 37].	"Arabidopsis thaliana	11	31	Organism"	"CAF - 1	42	49	GO_ontology"	"CAF - 1	96	103	GO_ontology"	"chromocenter	144	156	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Arabidopsis thaliana"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""chromocenter"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
The variable requirement for CAF - 1 across species might reflect the acquisition of new properties affecting the function of histone H3 variants during evolution of eukaryotes.

Following one or two rounds of DNA replication in the absence of p150CAF - 1, heterochromatin would become deprived of this molecule, which would cause the disruption of its 3 - D organization.

Given the importance of nuclear organization in the control of gene expression [ 21, 41], this finding suggests that CAF - 1 contributes to the coordinated programs of gene expression during early embryogenesis.

We show that in addition to assembling nucleosomes, CAF - 1 provides spatial and epigenetic information to heterochromatin domains in early embryos and ES cells.

However, this view was reevaluated when it was shown that either E2f1 or E2f3 deletion rescues apoptosis in the developing central nervous system ( CNS) of Rb KO embryos [ 6, 11].

Here, we establish that Rb suppresses RTC division and death by inhibiting E2f1, not E2f2 or E2f3.	"Rb	24	26	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"E2f1	75	79	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"E2f2	85	89	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"E2f3	93	97	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""E2f1"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""E2f2"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""E2f3"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, comprehensive assessment of the Rb / E2f1 double - null rescued retina revealed a differentiation defect in cholinergic starburst amacrine cells ( SACs).	"Rb	41	43	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"E2f1	46	50	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cholinergic	117	128	Chemical"	"amacrine cells	139	153	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""E2f1"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cholinergic"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""amacrine cells"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Thus, independent of E2f1 - mediated effects on division and death, Rb does regulate neuronal differentiation, but only in specific neurons and, unexpectedly, through E2f3a, not tissue - specific differentiation factors.

The discovery that E2f1 loss rescues even the morphology of Rb KO neurons is surprising because Rb is thought to regulate differentiation primarily through E2f - independent pathways [ 30 - 33].	"E2f1	19	23	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Rb	60	62	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"neurons	66	73	Cell"	"Rb	96	98	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""E2f1"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Responses were about the same in the WT and E2f1 KO retina, and, most importantly, also the Rb / E2f1 DKO response median lay at the lower end of the normal range for most intensities ( Figure 2F).

Indeed, this minor defect was rescued in the Rb / E2f1 / E2f3 triple knockout retina, where bipolar and ganglion cell death was rescued and SAC differentiation was restored ( Figure 4A).

The latter fraction is higher than WT because ganglion cells, which normally make up ~ 40% of Camk2a + cells, are killed by apoptosis.

We found that 98. 2% +/- 1. 8% of Isl1 + cells in the forming inner INL at P5 were also Slc18a3 +, confirming that Isl1 is an excellent SAC marker ( Figure 4C).

This defect was suppressed in the Rb / E2f1 DKO retina, where we detected only 1 +/- 1 dividing SAC, but not the Rb / E2f3 DKO retina, where there were 53 +/- 8 dividing SACs ( Figure 4D and 4E).

As the retina differentiated and RPC division diminished, the number of E2f3 + cells also dropped, and by P8, when division is virtually over, only a subset of post - mitotic cells in the inner retina expressed E2f3 ( Figure 5A).

Rb staining in SAC processes was specific as it was absent in the peripheral retina of alpha Cre; RbloxP / loxP mice ( Figure 5A).

These data suggest that Rb and E2f3 colocalize in SACs and that E2f3 triggers defects in SAC differentiation because it is specifically expressed in these retinal neurons.

Unlike in retinal SACs, E2f3 was not coexpressed in Chat + or Slc18a3 + cholinergic neurons located in various regions of the brain and spinal cord ( data not shown).

As noted above, E2f3 and Rb staining in SACs was both nuclear and cytoplasmic ( Figure 5A and 5B).

Analysis with the pan - E2f3 antibody ( sc - 878, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) detected a 55 - kD E2f3a species and a 40 - kD E2f3b polypeptide ( Figure 6).

To confirm that the upper species in our retinal lysates was E2f3a, we exploited novel mice that lack E2f3 exon 1a and thus express E2f3b exclusively ( R. O. and G. L., unpublished data).

At P0 and P18, E2f3a was present in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, but in marked contrast, E2f3b was exclusively nuclear at both times ( Figure 6).

Two closely migrating E2f3a bands were detected, more clearly evident at P18, of which the faster migrating species was dominant in nuclear and the slower species was dominant in cytoplasm ( Figure 6).

A very faint cytoplasmic Rb signal was evident at P18, which is consistent with Rb staining of SAC processes ( Figure 5B), and with the very small proportion of SACs in the retina [ 38].

To test which E2f3 isoform is responsible for aberrant Rb KO SAC differentiation we exploited E2f3a - / - mice ( Figure 7A).	"E2f3	14	18	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"isoform	19	26	Sequence"	"Rb	55	57	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	106	110	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""E2f3"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""isoform"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Reverse transcriptase PCR ( RT - PCR) confirmed the presence of both E2f3a and E2f3b RNA species in the developing WT retina, and the specific absence of E2f3a RNA in the E2f3a - / - retina ( Figure 7B).

Importantly, the levels of E2f3b message were similar in the Rb KO and Rb / E2f3a DKO retina, ruling out the possibility that any effects of E2f3a deletion we might observe were due to down - regulation of E2f3b ( Figure 7C).

Also, the levels of other E2fs were the same in the Rb KO, Rb / E2f3 DKO, and Rb / E2f3a DKO retina, ruling out any cross - regulatory effects ( Figure 7C) [ 55].

However, targeted KO and chimeric studies reveal that Rb autonomously promotes cell cycle exit in newborn neurons, and is required for survival of a subset of neurons, particularly in the retina [ 2, 3, 13, 14, 56 - 59].
