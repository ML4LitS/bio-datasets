Recent studies on hair bud morphogenesis suggest that Wnt signals likely from the epithelium and BMP inhibitory signals from the underlying mesenchyme converge to produce an active transcription factor complex involving beta - catenin and LEF - 1, which in turn plays a key role in specifying the hair follicle fate [ 4, 29, 30, 36, 37].

Possibly, the lack of dopamine D2R - mediated signaling prevents refinement of the corticostriatal reinforcement circuits in the brains of the D2R - / - mice, thus impairing their ability to form S + / S - contingencies and disengage inappropriate dopamine D1R - mediated associative responding when unexpected consequences to goal - directed behaviors happened.	dopamine D2R,22,34,Gene_or_geneproduct	D2R,143,146,Gene_or_geneproduct	mice,153,157,Organism	dopamine D1R,248,260,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""dopamine D2R"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""D2R"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""dopamine D1R"", ""start_span"": 248, ""end_span"": 260, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	valid
