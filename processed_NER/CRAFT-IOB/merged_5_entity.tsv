Therefore, we conclude that Sox9 is essential for Fgf9 expression, and Fgf9, in return, maintains Sox9 expression, generating a positive feed - forward loop between these two genes in XY gonads.

While CNCCs managed to migrate to the aortic sac and the truncal cushion level ( Fig. 6N, P, R), immunostaining for alpha SMA appeared much weaker when compared to controls and Alk5 mutants, implying that ALK2 - mediated signaling is involved in smooth muscle cell differentiation as previously suggested [ 12].	alpha SMA,116,125,Gene_or_geneproduct	Alk5,177,181,Gene_or_geneproduct	mutants,182,189,Sequence	ALK2,205,209,Gene_or_geneproduct	smooth muscle cell,246,264,Cell	"[{""token"": ""alpha SMA"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Alk5"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 181, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutants"", ""start_span"": 182, ""end_span"": 189, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""ALK2"", ""start_span"": 205, ""end_span"": 209, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""smooth muscle cell"", ""start_span"": 246, ""end_span"": 264, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	train

BMP2, BMP4, and BMP7 are all expressed in the interdigital mesenchyme [ 4, 14], and experiments inhibiting BMP signaling in this tissue suggested that differential levels of BMPs in the interdigital mesenchyme might be the relevant factor directing digit morphology [ 15].

As noted above, BMP7 - deficient embryos produce mostly normal limbs, and mice harboring a conditional deletion of Bmp4 in the limb bud mesenchyme also do not show evidence of anterior digit transformation [ 16], as would have been predicted if BMP4 acted as an interdigital regulator of digit morphology.

From these results, we conclude that Dmrt7 mutant cells establish a normal XY body in mid - pachynema, but then have multiple epigenetic defects in the sex chromatin transition from pachynema to diplonema.

Thus, although a minority of Dmrt7 mutant germ cells can progress from pachynema to diplonema, there are defects in sex chromatin modification during the transition.

Because most Dmrt7 mutant germ cells are eliminated by apoptosis around the time at which we observed sex chromatin defects, a simple model is that the apoptosis is a consequence of the sex chromatin defects.

The unusual relatedness between mammalian and plant PCH2 may therefore be attributable to both the presence of a common conserved function ( namely recombination, although the role of PCH2 in plants has yet to be determined), and the absence of checkpoint function.	mammalian,32,41,Organism	plant,46,51,Organism	PCH2,52,56,Gene_or_geneproduct	PCH2,184,188,Gene_or_geneproduct	plants,192,198,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mammalian"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""plant"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""PCH2"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""PCH2"", ""start_span"": 184, ""end_span"": 188, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""plants"", ""start_span"": 192, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	train

For example, while the expanded domain of Agouti expression in postnatal deH / deH animals can be traced to events that occur between E11. 5 and E13. 5, the underlying cause may be that embryonic cells in dorsolateral mesenchyme acquire a ventral rather than dorsal identity or that those cells fail to proliferate normally, followed by compensatory expansion of ventral cells.

One of the most curious findings in the rd7 mutant retina was the occurrence of two different types of changes: an increase in the number of S - opsin - expressing cones and a transformation of rods into hybrid photoreceptors.	mutant,44,50,Sequence	S - opsin,141,150,Gene_or_geneproduct	cones,164,169,Cell	rods,194,198,Cell	photoreceptors,211,225,Cell	"[{""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""S - opsin"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cones"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 169, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""rods"", ""start_span"": 194, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""photoreceptors"", ""start_span"": 211, ""end_span"": 225, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	valid
An alternative explanation would be that there is only a single, homogeneous population of postmitotic rod precursors in the mouse, and a stochastic event triggers assumption of the S - cone fate in a small subpopulation of these cells in the rd7 mutant.	rod,103,106,Cell	mouse,125,130,Organism	cone,186,190,Cell	cells,230,235,Cell	mutant,247,253,Sequence	"[{""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 186, ""end_span"": 190, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 230, ""end_span"": 235, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 247, ""end_span"": 253, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"	valid
Alternatively, the ratio of supernumerary S - cones to hybrid photoreceptors produced in the retina of ESCS patients might be such that a higher percentage of the presumptive rods in ESCS patients become S - cones rather than hybrid photoreceptors.	cones,46,51,Cell	photoreceptors,62,76,Cell	rods,175,179,Cell	cones,208,213,Cell	photoreceptors,233,247,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cones"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""photoreceptors"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""rods"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 179, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cones"", ""start_span"": 208, ""end_span"": 213, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""photoreceptors"", ""start_span"": 233, ""end_span"": 247, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	valid

Wnt and nodal antagonists, Dkk1 ( mdkk - 1) and Lefty1 respectively, are expressed in the AVE and are important in limiting the posteriorization of the anterior embryo by restricting Nodal and Wnt signaling [ 41 - 43].	nodal,8,13,Gene_or_geneproduct	Dkk1,27,31,Gene_or_geneproduct	mdkk - 1,34,42,Gene_or_geneproduct	Lefty1,48,54,Gene_or_geneproduct	Nodal,183,188,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""nodal"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Dkk1"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mdkk - 1"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Lefty1"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Nodal"", ""start_span"": 183, ""end_span"": 188, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	test

Secondly, highlighting the potential relevance of current findings to all diploid organisms including humans was the observation that in one compound heterozygous animal, the Xpd allelic relationship could shift from Adominant | arecessive to Arecessive | adominant with respect to different phenotypes in a time - dependent and tissue - specific manner ( see below and Table 2).	organisms,82,91,Organism	humans,102,108,Organism	animal,163,169,Organism	Xpd,175,178,Gene_or_geneproduct	allelic,179,186,Sequence	"[{""token"": ""organisms"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""humans"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""animal"", ""start_span"": 163, ""end_span"": 169, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Xpd"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""allelic"", ""start_span"": 179, ""end_span"": 186, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"	test

However, based on the ability of cell extracts that are defective in two different TFIIH components ( XPD and XPB) to complement NER activity in vitro [ 26], it is likely that TFIIH ( or its components) can either multimerise or exchange at least during the NER reaction.	cell,33,37,Cell	TFIIH,83,88,GO_ontology	XPD,102,105,Gene_or_geneproduct	XPB,110,113,Gene_or_geneproduct	TFIIH,176,181,GO_ontology	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""TFIIH"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""XPD"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""XPB"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""TFIIH"", ""start_span"": 176, ""end_span"": 181, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"	test
