The purpose of this study was to determine the IOPs of genetically distinct mouse strains, assess the effects of factors such as age, sex and time of day on IOP in specific strain backgrounds, and to assess the effects of specific candidate gene mutations on IOP.

Albino C57BL / 6J mice homozygous for a tyrosinase mutation ( Tyrc - 2J) have higher IOPs than their pigmented counterparts.

Mutations in two of the assessed candidate genes ( Lepr and Tyr) result in increased IOP.

Similarly, 6 to 9 month old males and females that are homozygous for normal ( +) or mutant ( n) alleles of Car2 have similar IOPs ( n = 18 and 14, respectively).

In 2 month old mice, homozygosity for Tyrc - 2J resulted in increased IOP ( 14. 2 +/- 0. 4 mmHg) compared to wild type, pigmented mice ( 12. 4 +/- 0. 3 mmHg, P < 0. 0001).

Thus it is feasible to assess sufficient numbers of mice for quantitative trait locus ( QTL) analysis methods and to use these methods to identify chromosomal regions contributing to strain differences in IOP.

The IOP increase in the dark is not dependent on functional rod and cone photoreceptors since these cells degenerate in SWR / J mice due to homozygosity for the Pde6brd1 mutation.

One or both DNA ends formed by the break invade ( s) the homologous sequence in the second mutant GFP copy, resulting in repair of the DSB via a homology - mediated gene conversion event.

Moynahan et al [ 24] have used such a GFP recombination substrate to demonstrate that cells with defective BRCA2 protein are deficient in their ability to repair the I - SceI - induced DSB through homologous recombination.

While the experimental design of these experiments was somewhat different from that of Moyna - han et al [ 24], the results raise the possibility that CAPAN - 1 cells have more than one mutation that lowers the efficiency of recombinational repair relative to that observed in other human cell lines.

The second paper providing evidence, by Davies et al [ 26], is a biochemical study of the interaction between the homologous recombinase RAD51 and a peptide consisting of one of the eight BRC repeats from human BRCA2.

DNA binding assays and electron microscopy methods were used to show that a BRC3 peptide interferes with the ability of RAD51 to assemble into oligomeric filaments on DNA.	"DNA	0	3	Sequence"	"peptide	81	88	Sequence"	"RAD51	120	125	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"DNA	167	170	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""DNA"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""peptide"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""RAD51"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""DNA"", ""start_span"": 167, ""end_span"": 170, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
These experiments raise the possibility that the full - length BRCA2 protein could act as a negative regulator of inappropriate RAD51 - DNA interaction.

Alternatively, or in addition, suppression of RAD51 - ssDNA interaction might be important for preventing RAD51 from binding to the regions of ssDNA that form during normal DNA replication.

Yet another potential role for BRCA2 in promoting RAD51 - dependent recombinational repair is a positive role in assembly of RAD51 at damaged sites ( Fig. 2b).

BRCA2 could cooperate with RAD51 paralogs in promoting RAD51 assembly, or even provide an alternative assembly pathway.

The observation that BRCA2 localizes to damage - induced subnuclear foci with RAD51 seems consistent with the possibility that BRCA2 plays a positive role in assembly of the recombination complex [ 11].

BRCA2 could prevent inappropriate RAD51 assembly in the absence of damage and promote functional RAD51 assembly at DNA lesions during the damage response.

In essence, this theory of regulation of neuronal connections via neurotrophic support implies that only limited quantities of neurotrophins are released by the target tissue to support only properly connected sensory neurons by providing only these with a critical amount of neurotrophins [ 21].

Since BDNF appears to be exclusively produced by hair cells [ 6, 7, 20], the lack of terminal differentiation of hair cells appears to be accompanied by only limited expression of BDNF, as is the case in the canal cristae ( Fig. 8).

However, the assignment of most of these genes as olfactory receptors is based solely on similarity to one of a relatively small number of experimentally confirmed mouse olfactory receptors or, worse, on similarity to a gene that in turn was defined as an olfactory receptor solely by similarity.

Furthermore, each olfactory neuron expresses only one allele [ 16] of a single olfactory receptor gene [ 17, 18], and the remaining approximately 1, 499 genes are transcriptionally inactive.

However, computational prediction of the location of 5 ' upstream exons and the extent of the 3 ' UTR from genomic sequence has been extremely difficult.

A combination of splice site predictions and similarity to other olfactory receptors has allowed some investigators to predict 5 ' exon locations for around 15 genes [ 25, 28].

These clones confirm olfactory expression of over 400 olfactory receptors, provide their gene structure, demonstrate that not all olfactory receptors are expressed at the same level and show that most olfactory receptor genes have multiple transcriptional isoforms.

We used low - stringency hybridization with degenerate olfactory receptor DNA probes to screen around 4, 100, 000 plaque - forming units ( pfu) of an adult mouse olfactory epithelium cDNA library and around 640, 000 pfu of an embryonic olfactory epithelium library.

We created a local database of genomic sequences including all olfactory receptor loci and 0. 5 Mb flanking sequences ( if available) and compared each cDNA sequence to this ' olfactory subgenome ' database using sim4 [ 30].

Most of the motif is shared among all olfactory receptors, but the first proline residue ( at the primer ' s 3 ' end) is found in 121 out of 124 ( 98%) intact class I genes compared to only 37 out of 983 ( 4%) intact class II genes.

Expression levels were similar to those observed for genes that were represented in our cDNA collection, suggesting that class I olfactory receptors are not under - represented in the olfactory epithelium, and that the dearth of class I cDNAs in our screen is likely to be due to bias in the libraries and / or hybridization probes.

In situ hybridization ( Figure 4) shows that increased numbers of expressing cells account for some, but not all, of the difference in transcript levels between two of the genes tested by real - time PCR ( genes A and D in Figure 3).

However, the possibility remains that DNA recombination is responsible for olfactory receptor transcriptional regulation, with the donated region contributing only promoter sequences but no part of the transcript.

Of the eight intact singleton olfactory receptors, two have matching cDNAs in our collection, a similar proportion as found for olfactory receptors in clusters, showing that clustering is not an absolute requirement for olfactory receptor expression.

However, three of these 15 ' expressed pseudogenes ' are intact genes in the public mouse genome sequence.

Publicly available mouse sequence confirms that 11 of the 12 remaining expressed pseudogenes are indeed pseudogenes.

Higher expression levels could be due to increased transcript number per cell and / or a greater number of olfactory neurons ' choosing ' those genes.

It would be interesting to collect data for additional genes to determine how the numbers of expressing cells and transcript levels per cell vary across the olfactory receptor family.	"genes	55	60	Sequence"	"cells	104	109	Cell"	"transcript	114	124	Sequence"	"cell	136	140	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""transcript"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The fact that some genes are chosen more frequently, and when chosen may be expressed at higher levels per cell, is intriguing given each olfactory neuron ' s single - allele expression regime.

The UTRs would therefore make a better choice of sequence from which to design unique oligonucleotides to distinguish closely related olfactory receptor genes.

We find that the majority of the olfactory receptors, like most non - olfactory receptor genes [ 38, 39], are transcribed as multiple isoforms, involving alternative splicing of 5 ' untranslated exons and alternate polyadenylation - site usage.

The neurons expressing these aberrant transcripts might also make normal transcripts for the same genes and thus produce a functional olfactory receptor.

We also observe transcripts from a small number of olfactory receptor pseudogenes, as previously described for three human olfactory receptor pseudogenes [ 26, 44].

Although many fewer pseudogenes than intact genes were represented in our cDNA collection, some neurons in the olfactory epithelium evidently express disrupted olfactory receptors and thus might be unable to respond to odorants or to correctly innervate the olfactory bulb.

To verify whether the mRNA changes resulted in alteration of the enzyme activity changes, liver samples were analyzed for HMG - CoA reductase activity and Cyp7a1 activity ( Figure 4b).

Using the SC anti - Abcg5 / sterolin - 1 peptide antibody, a 75 kDa band is detected ( Figure 5a).

In acute transfection studies, the SC antibody recognized over - expressed mouse Abcg5 / sterolin - 1 in COS - 1 cells, but not mouse Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 ( Figure 6b, 6c).

As a control, the expression of Abcb11, an ABC transporter known to be responsible for the export of bile salts, was compared to that of Abcg5 / sterolin - 1 ( Figure 6j, 6k).	"Abcb11	32	38	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"bile salts	101	111	Chemical"	"Abcg5	137	142	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"sterolin - 1	145	157	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Abcb11"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""bile salts"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""Abcg5"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""sterolin - 1"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Again, there is apical expression of Abcg5 / sterolin - 1 in both wild - type and knockout livers ( Figure 7a, 7b).

There was no difference between wild - type and heterozygous mice, but knockout mice showed a trend of lower phospholipid secretion during both the depletion and infusion phase.

Since the Abcg8 - / - mice still secreted some sterols we were interested in which biliary sterol species were being secreted.	"Abcg8	10	15	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	22	26	Organism"	"sterols	47	54	Chemical"	"sterol	91	97	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Abcg8"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""sterols"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""sterol"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
The mechanism by which dietary cholesterol is specifically absorbed and dietary non - cholesterol sterols primarily excluded or the mechanism ( s) by which the liver can selectively secrete sterols has not been elucidated.	"cholesterol	31	42	Chemical"	"cholesterol	86	97	Chemical"	"sterols	98	105	Chemical"	"sterols	190	197	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""cholesterol"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""cholesterol"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""sterols"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""sterols"", ""start_span"": 190, ""end_span"": 197, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Additionally, the activity of the rate - limiting enzyme for bile acid synthesis, CYP7a1, is reduced, although no changes at the mRNA level are noted.	"enzyme	50	56	Sequence"	"bile acid	61	70	Chemical"	"CYP7a1	82	88	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mRNA	129	133	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""enzyme"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""bile acid"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""CYP7a1"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mRNA"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Furthermore, complete loss of Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 results in an inability to secrete cholesterol into bile, although secretion of sitosterol seemed to be preserved.	"Abcg8	30	35	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"sterolin - 2	38	50	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cholesterol	86	97	Chemical"	"sitosterol	131	141	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Abcg8"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""sterolin - 2"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cholesterol"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""sitosterol"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Despite this reservation, the finding that sitosterol is present in the bile suggests that plant sterols may be secreted independent of Abcg8 / sterolin - 2.	"sitosterol	43	53	Chemical"	"plant sterols	91	104	Chemical"	"Abcg8	136	141	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"sterolin - 2	144	156	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""sitosterol"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""plant sterols"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""Abcg8"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""sterolin - 2"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Collectively these data suggest that Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 is necessary for hepatobiliary cholesterol secretion in mice.	"Abcg8	37	42	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"sterolin - 2	45	57	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cholesterol	89	100	Chemical"	"mice	114	118	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Abcg8"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""sterolin - 2"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cholesterol"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Abcg8 - / - mice appeared normal and healthy maintained on a regular rodent chow diet.	"Abcg8	0	5	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	12	16	Organism"	"rodent	69	75	Organism"	"chow	76	80	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Abcg8"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""rodent"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""chow"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
In preliminary studies, when knockout mice are placed on a low sitosterol diet, the activity of this enzyme, as well as the mRNA levels are increased ( E Klett and S Patel, unpublished observations).	"mice	38	42	Organism"	"sitosterol	63	73	Chemical"	"enzyme	101	107	Sequence"	"mRNA	124	128	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""sitosterol"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""enzyme"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""mRNA"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Thus, Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 is necessary for cholesterol secretion but not necessary for plant sterol secretion.	"Abcg8	6	11	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"sterolin - 2	14	26	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cholesterol	44	55	Chemical"	"plant sterol	88	100	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Abcg8"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""sterolin - 2"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cholesterol"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""plant sterol"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
While biliary cholesterol secretion is not completely absent in the Abcg8 - deficient mice it would appear that sterolin - 2 plays a major role in this process.

We, as well as others, have proposed Abcg5 / sterolin - 1 and Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 to function as obligate heterodimers.

In a recent paper, Mangrivite et al. showed that the apical sorting of rat SPNT in polarized renal epithelial cells was independent of N - glycosylation [ 45].

More extensive fractionation experiments are underway to better determine the exact compartmental location of Abcg5 / sterolin - 1 in the Abcg8 - / - mice.

These data strongly support the direct role of Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 as a key player in biliary cholesterol secretion, although biliary sitosterol secretion was apparently preserved.

The abnormal transport and processing of cathepsin D suggested membrane trafficking disruptions in homozygous CbCln3 Delta ex7 / 8 cells; therefore, we surveyed the subcellular distribution and morphology of membrane organelles.

It is noteworthy that Lysotracker dye, which selectively accumulates in acidic compartments, exhibited the most marked reduction in lysosomal labeling.

We subsequently showed that when E - cadherin is transgenically elevated in mouse skin, hair follicle morphogenesis is blocked, suggesting that E - cadherin down - regulation is a critical event in governing the adhesion dynamics necessary for budding morphogenesis [ 4].

Both activity of Snail and down - regulation of E - cadherin play pivotal roles in epithelial to mesenchymal transitions ( EMTs), typified by the transformation of polarized, adhering epithelial cells into motile mesenchymal cells [ 16, 17].

The antibody also recognized a band corresponding to the size of endogenous Snail ( approximately 28 kDa) in lysates from embryonic mouse skin, the temporal appearance of which corresponded to the waves of hair follicle morphogenesis from E15. 5 to newborn when over 90% of the hair on the mouse is formed ( Figure 1B).

As judged by immunohistochemistry, Snail protein was localized to the nuclei of the hair bud cells ( Figure 1E).

As judged by immunofluorescence with antibodies against the proliferating nuclear antigen Ki67, the timing of Snail expression coincided with the stage at which the developing follicle enhanced its proliferation and down - growth ( Figure 1F).

The timing of Snail induction and Ki67 and pMAPK enrichment in the hair bud appeared to follow closely the induction of LEF - 1 / beta - catenin activity, known to initiate in the hair placode stage [ 20].

Aberrant staining was also observed with antibodies against components of the hemidesmosomes, which provide strong adhesion of basal epidermal cells to the underlying basal lamina ( Figure 3M and 3N).

Interestingly, however, despite appreciable immunofluorescence, localization of beta - catenin and Ajuba appeared to be largely cytoplasmic rather than at cell - cell borders ( Figure 4A insets).

In both back skin and ear skin, overall levels of E - cadherin and alpha - catenin were reduced, under conditions where beta - catenin and Ajuba levels remained unchanged relative to controls ( Figure 4B).	"E - cadherin	50	62	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"alpha - catenin	67	82	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"beta - catenin	120	134	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Ajuba	139	144	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""E - cadherin"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""alpha - catenin"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""beta - catenin"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Ajuba"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
To distinguish between these possibilities, we tested whether alpha - catenin levels could be restored by exogenous expression of E - cadherin in Snail - expressing keratinocytes.	"alpha - catenin	62	77	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"E - cadherin	130	142	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Snail	146	151	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"keratinocytes	165	178	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""alpha - catenin"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""E - cadherin"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""keratinocytes"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Despite the reductions in AJ markers, Tg skin still displayed sealed membranes and intercellular junctions that were largely intact, as judged by ultrastructural analyses ( unpublished data).

In this respect, the skin epithelium resembled that of the hair bud, where the down - regulation in junction proteins is permissive for cell - cell remodeling without abrogating intercellular adhesion.

The similarities between Snail Tg epidermis and hair buds extended to the hyperproliferative state, leading us to wonder whether the down - regulation of AJ proteins might contribute to this condition.

Given the increase in pMAPK staining in Snail Tg epidermis ( see Figure 2G), we used pMAPK levels as our assay to test whether the loss of E - cadherin contributed to the Snail - mediated increase in proliferation.

Together, these findings raised the possibility that an AJ - associated protein that is normally sequestered at the plasma membrane may participate in a proliferation signaling pathway when AJs are deconstructed.

When these experiments were repeated with alpha - catenin - null epidermis, a similar Grb - 2 - Ajuba association was detected, and again, this interaction was not detected in the protein extracts from control littermate skin ( Figure 4E).

Of the loss - of - function mutations generated in each of the TGF - beta genes, only the TGF - beta 2 null state blocked follicle development at the hair bud stage [ 32].

Though there is no cell culture system available to specifically study placodal cells, these keratinocytes are their progenitors and are the closest approximation available to study the behavior of epithelial cells of the placode.

By contrast, although TGF - beta receptor activation remained elevated during the duration of the experiment ( as measured by the sustained phosphorylation of the downstream effector SMAD2) Snail expression could not be maintained ( Figure 5B).

The kinetics of Snail promoter activity closely paralleled those observed for Snail protein induction.

Moreover, the downstream effector of TGF - beta 2 signaling, pSMAD2, was also expressed in WT, but not TGF - beta 2 - null, hair buds ( Figure 6B).

Together, these data underscore the importance of the TGF - beta 2 isoform despite expression of both TGF - beta 1 and TGF - beta 2 in developing hair buds at this stage.

To further explore the possible relation between Snail and TGF - beta 2, we examined the status of Snail expression in TGF - beta 2 - null hair buds.	"Snail	49	54	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"TGF - beta 2	59	71	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Snail	99	104	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"TGF - beta 2	119	131	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""TGF - beta 2"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""TGF - beta 2"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
If TGF - beta 2 stimulates Snail expression in developing buds, loss of this morphogen would be expected to affect the expression of genes that are typically repressed by Snail.	"TGF - beta 2	3	15	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Snail	27	32	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"genes	133	138	Sequence"	"Snail	171	176	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""TGF - beta 2"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 171, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Since a major target for Snail - mediated repression is the E - cadherin gene [ 12, 13], we investigated the status of E - cadherin in TGF - beta 2 - null buds.	"Snail	25	30	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"gene	73	77	Sequence"	"E - cadherin	119	131	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"TGF - beta 2	135	147	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""gene"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""E - cadherin"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""TGF - beta 2"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 147, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Moreover, through activation of Snail gene expression, TGF - beta 2 appears to work in tandem with these other morphogens to down - regulate E - cadherin levels, which contributes to the activation of proliferative circuitries.	"Snail	32	37	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"gene	38	42	Sequence"	"TGF - beta 2	55	67	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"E - cadherin	141	153	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""gene"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""TGF - beta 2"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""E - cadherin"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Recent studies on hair bud morphogenesis suggest that Wnt signals likely from the epithelium and BMP inhibitory signals from the underlying mesenchyme converge to produce an active transcription factor complex involving beta - catenin and LEF - 1, which in turn plays a key role in specifying the hair follicle fate [ 4, 29, 30, 36, 37].	"BMP	97	100	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"transcription factor complex	181	209	GO_ontology"	"beta - catenin	220	234	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"LEF - 1	239	246	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""transcription factor complex"", ""start_span"": 181, ""end_span"": 209, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""beta - catenin"", ""start_span"": 220, ""end_span"": 234, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""LEF - 1"", ""start_span"": 239, ""end_span"": 246, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The additional correlation between epithelial hyperproliferation and Snail transgene expression further fostered our interest in a possible link between TGF - beta 2 and Snail.

At first glance, the sparsity in hair coat of K14 - Snail Tg mice seemed indicative of a defect in follicle formation ( see Figure 2A).	"K14	46	49	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Snail	52	57	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Tg	58	60	Sequence"	"mice	61	65	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""K14"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Tg"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Conditional gene targeting studies will be necessary to establish whether Snail family members also contribute to the down - regulation in E - cadherin gene expression that occurs during follicle formation.

However, it is intriguing that K14 - Snail Tg epidermis displayed a marked down - regulation in E - cadherin expression, thereby demonstrating its potential to do so in skin.

Crx gene expression is critically dependent upon Otx2, another member of the same homeobox family which is expressed in early photoreceptor cells [ 8].

Recessive mutations also have been reported and at least one allele encodes a protein with decreased DNA - binding activity [ 16].

At the other extremity, photoreceptors terminate with synaptic endings that make contact with the processes of horizontal and bipolar cells [ 31, 32].

Further, these cells exhibit abnormal synaptic morphology, thereby broadening the function of Crx to photoreceptor synaptogenesis.

Occasionally, these nuclei appeared pyknotic ( Figure 3A, n); but, more frequently exhibited the heterochromatin pattern typical of photoreceptors ( data not shown), strongly suggesting that they belonged to ectopic photoreceptors.

In order to characterize further the morphogenesis of Crx - / - photoreceptors, the developing outer segment layer was viewed by scanning electron microscopy at P7, P14 and P21 ( Figure 4).	"Crx	54	57	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"photoreceptors	64	78	Cell"	"outer segment	95	108	GO_ontology"	"electron	138	146	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Crx"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""photoreceptors"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""outer segment"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""electron"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
In Crx - / - retinae, the vast majority of photoreceptors at this stage demonstrated connecting cilia without outer segments ( Figure 4D, cc).	"Crx	3	6	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"photoreceptors	43	57	Cell"	"connecting cilia	85	101	GO_ontology"	"outer segments	110	124	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Crx"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 6, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""photoreceptors"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""connecting cilia"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""outer segments"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Sporadically, Crx - / - photoreceptors would exhibit an irregular structure extending from a connecting cilium ( Figure 4D, cc *) perhaps representing a malformed outer segment.	"Crx	14	17	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"photoreceptors	24	38	Cell"	"connecting cilium	93	110	GO_ontology"	"outer segment	163	176	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Crx"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""photoreceptors"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""connecting cilium"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""outer segment"", ""start_span"": 163, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
These putative, abnormal outer segments were only rarely noted in Crx + / + at P14, and never at P21 ( Figure 4C and 4E, cc *).

In Crx + / + retinas at P21, newly mature rod spherules were abundant ( Figure 7A).

Two processes from horizontal cells were situated on either side of the synaptic ridge ( Figure 8B, labelled H) and one or more dendrites of rod bipolar cells occupied a central position ( Figure 8B, bipolar labelled B).

Cone terminals are large, flat pedicles that exhibit many invaginating synapses containing separate sets of horizontal and bipolar cell processes.

These terminals were much less common than spherules in Crx + / + retinas at P21 ( Figure 7, box).

Using northern blots [ 34], microarrays [ 10], and serial analysis of gene expression ( SAGE) [ 35], we have defined a large number of genes that are altered in their expression level in Crx - / - mice.	"gene	70	74	Sequence"	"genes	135	140	Sequence"	"Crx	187	190	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	197	201	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""gene"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Crx"", ""start_span"": 187, ""end_span"": 190, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 197, ""end_span"": 201, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In Drosophila, rhodopsin ( ninaE) is expressed in photoreceptors R1 - R6.	"Drosophila	3	13	Organism"	"rhodopsin	15	24	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"ninaE	27	32	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"photoreceptors R1 - R6	50	72	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""rhodopsin"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""ninaE"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""photoreceptors R1 - R6"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Thus, through its regulation of rhodopsin levels, or perhaps through control of the kinetics of the up - regulation of rhodopsin beginning at about P6, Crx may be regulating outer segment morphogenesis.	"rhodopsin	32	41	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"rhodopsin	119	128	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Crx	152	155	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"outer segment	174	187	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""rhodopsin"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""rhodopsin"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Crx"", ""start_span"": 152, ""end_span"": 155, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""outer segment"", ""start_span"": 174, ""end_span"": 187, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Those that are expressed at a lower level in the Crx - / - retina, such as rhodopsin and peripherin, comprise many that are either enriched or specific to photoreceptors in their expression [ 35].	"Crx	49	52	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"rhodopsin	75	84	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"peripherin	89	99	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"photoreceptors	155	169	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Crx"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""rhodopsin"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""peripherin"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""photoreceptors"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 169, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
They include enzymes that are important in lipid metabolism, protein folding and transport, as well as in other processes that one might envision would be important in building a structure such as the outer segment.

Another LCA gene, CRB1, and a related gene CRB3, have been implicated in ciliogenesis in in vitro models [ 46].

The Crx - / - mouse demonstrates the most severe abnormality of photoreceptor synapses reported to date.	"Crx	4	7	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mouse	14	19	Organism"	"photoreceptor	64	77	Cell"	"synapses	78	86	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Crx"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""synapses"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
In vitro studies wherein synapse elements are formed in the absence of proper outer segment development and, therefore, possible absence of light - dependent photoreceptor activity, have indicated the independence of phototransduction and synapse formation, at least for the initial stages [ 50, 51].	"synapse elements	25	41	GO_ontology"	"outer segment	78	91	GO_ontology"	"photoreceptor	158	171	Cell"	"synapse	239	246	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""synapse elements"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""outer segment"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 158, ""end_span"": 171, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""synapse"", ""start_span"": 239, ""end_span"": 246, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
These data then suggest that the fact that the Crx - / - photoreceptors do not have proper synaptic endings is not due to a lack of outer segment formation.	"Crx	47	50	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"photoreceptors	57	71	Cell"	"synaptic endings	91	107	GO_ontology"	"outer segment	132	145	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Crx"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""photoreceptors"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""synaptic endings"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""outer segment"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
A more likely explanation is that Crx plays a role in photoreceptor synapse formation, perhaps by regulating directly, or indirectly, important genes in this process.

It is not known whether any of these genes are involved in building or regulating synaptic structures, but they are now genes that might lead to a better understanding of the construction and function of the relatively unique structure of the ribbon synapse.

To test the hypothesis that a temporal delay in the onset of transcriptional programs is crucial for the control of appropriate neuronal maturation, we studied the development of proprioceptive DRG neurons, since transcriptional effectors regulated by target - derived signals, as well as some of their downstream biological actions, have been identified for these neurons.

Er81 controls proprioceptive afferent connectivity [ 14], and we therefore sought to identify an ETS transcriptional regulator that, when expressed over the normal time course of Er81 expression, is able to substitute for Er81 function within group Ia afferent sensory neurons.

Induction of Er81 expression in proprioceptive afferents is controlled by peripheral NT - 3 as axons reach the vicinity of target muscles, and thus occurs only approximately 3 d after proprioceptive neurons become post - mitotic [ 9, 14].

Furthermore, a number of physiological studies have suggested that the transduction of some amphiphilic bitter compounds, such as quinine and denatonium benzoate, may stimulate taste receptor cells independently of GPCRs ( e. g.

BXD / Ty - 34 RI mice display a clear D2 phenotype for QHCl taste ( Figure 1C) and D2 genotype for D6Mit13, but have a B6 genotype for D6Mit61 [ 39, 40], indicating that D6Mit61 is unlinked to the QHCl QTL.

Because of their proximity to the linked marker, their demonstrated expression in taste receptor cells, and their role in the detection of at least some bitter - tasting compounds, we hypothesized that one or more of the 24 Tas2rs at this locus were responsible for the major QHCl taste sensitivity QTL.

Furthermore, the genotype of each Tas2r gene always correlated with the QHCl taste phenotype ( Figures 6, 7), suggesting that the entire Tas2r cluster is a single haplotype that varies with QHCl taster status.

As of yet there is no evidence for quinine activation of T2Rs from functional assays of these receptors in heterologous cells or membrane preparations, likely due to the lipophilic nature of quinine [ 23].

It is well recognized that bone marrow stromal cells give rise to both osteoblasts and adipocytes and that age - related bone loss is accompanied by an increase in differentiation down the adipocyte lineage [ 22].

In contrast, the bones of 12 - month - old Sam68 - / - mice appeared similar to those of the 4 - month - old mice of either genotype.

The Src tyrosine kinase was shown to play a role in bone remodeling when Src - / - mice died at 6 months of age with an osteopetrotic phenotype [ 48] and the defect was attributed to defective osteoclast function [ 55 - 59].

The pathway by which leptin regulates bone resorption was identified to involve the sympathetic nervous system relaying to the osteoblasts via the beta - adrenergic pathway leading to the release of growth factors including RANKL that causes the osteoclasts to thrive [ 8, 18 - 20].

The lowering of leptin levels in aged Sam68 - / - mice is consistent with these mice having a high bone mass compared with their aged littermates.

Disruption of Capn1, encoding the mu - calpain catalytic subunit, was subsequently reported to result in fertile, viable mice with some mild defects in the mu - calpain rich platelets relating to their aggregation and clot retraction [ 33].

Eight chimeric male mice were produced in morula aggregation experiments using the Capn2 + / - ES27 cell line.

Interestingly, a similar over - representation of heterozygous animals was also reported in one of the Capn4 transgenic lines, though the genotype skewing was not as extreme [ 32].	"animals	63	70	Organism"	"Capn4	103	108	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"transgenic	109	119	Sequence"	"genotype	138	146	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Capn4"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""transgenic"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""genotype"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
An even higher degree of Capn2 + / - over - representation was seen when the mutant allele came the mother ( 73%) compared to when it came from the father ( 59%).

This procedure has been extensively applied to targeted ES cells and was readily achieved in the case of Capn4 + / - ES cells [ 31].	"cells	59	64	Cell"	"Capn4	105	110	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"+	111	112	Sequence"	"cells	120	125	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Capn4"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""+"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
These options were narrowed down by the subsequent observation that Capn1 - / - mice, which lack the mu - calpain catalytic subunit, were healthy and fertile, although platelet aggregation and clot retraction defects were observed [ 33].	"Capn1	68	73	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	80	84	Organism"	"mu - calpain catalytic subunit	101	131	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"platelet	168	176	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Capn1"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mu - calpain catalytic subunit"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""platelet"", ""start_span"": 168, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This strategy was based upon previous structure / function studies showing that excision of the C - terminal 25 amino acid residues of the small subunit abolished calpain activity when co - expressed with the m - calpain large subunit in E. coli [ 34].

The Zimmerman allele probably represents a true null genotype while the Arthur allele is likely a hypomorphic mutation.

These transcripts could give rise to defective calpain small subunits with 10 - 30 inappropriate C - terminal acids, which might be sufficient to support a low level of calpain activity.

In both CHO cells and Capn4 - / - MEFs, calpain was shown to influence cell proliferation, but only at very low cell densities [ 5].

It should also be stressed that Capn4 - / - ES and MEF cells from the presumptive hypomorphic allele can be maintained in culture despite an apparent lack of calpain activity, as assessed by casein zymography or by the appearance of characteristic spectrin breakdown products.

It is conceivable, as discussed earlier, that a trace amount of calpain activity, beneath levels detectable by these methods, is retained from this mutant Capn4 allele, and it is sufficient for maintaining the viability of the cells.

These findings led us to hypothesise that ADAM11 is an integrin binder that plays an important role in the nervous system, as do ADAM22 and ADAM23.

To study the functions of ADAM11 in the hippocampus, we examined the spatial learning ability of ADAM11 - deficient mice using the Morris Water Maze task [ 27].

To date numerous mouse growth and obesity QTL have been localized [ 1, 2], however, little progress has been made in determining the specific nature of the underlying genetic variants.

This is accomplished by eliminating segregating genetic variation outside the locus of interest and reducing the environmental variation influencing a trait by characterizing large numbers of genetically identical mice.

Since the primary function of Socs2 is to negatively regulate growth hormone ( Gh) [ 23], it is likely these background effects are the result of polymorphism influencing interactions between members of the Gh signaling pathway.

Due to the overlapping nature of the MMU2 congenics, five distinct chromosomal regions ( Regions I - V) were queried for the presence of QTL ( Figure 2).	"overlapping	11	22	Sequence"	"chromosomal regions	67	86	Sequence"	"Regions	89	96	Sequence"	"QTL	137	140	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""overlapping"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""chromosomal regions"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Regions"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""QTL"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Therefore, the B62D unique region ( Region V) harbors either an early - growth QTL or maternal genotype effect which produces a distinct decrease in body weight prior to 2WK.	"region	27	33	Sequence"	"Region	36	42	Sequence"	"QTL	79	82	Sequence"	"genotype	95	103	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""region"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Region"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""QTL"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""genotype"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
The decrease in NA in B62M mice is surprising since the 2M donor region is entirely nested within the 2D donor region and B62D mice showed no difference in NA ( Figure 2).

These results indicate QTL within Region II shared between the HG2P and HG2PM strains decrease body size, weight gain and NA ( only in females), while a QTL in the HG2M region significantly decreases tail length.

Significant interactions between donor region and HG genotype were viewed as strong evidence that hg modifier QTL reside within that unique genomic region.

This was expected since NA was previously found to be an excellent indicator of femur length ( R2 = 0. 88) in HG mice [ 27] and as noted above this region contains the Feml2 QTL [ 24].

Comparison with the public B6 assembly ( May 2004 University of California, Santa Cruz ( UCSC [ 28]) mm5 genome assembly, National Center for Biotechnology Information ( NCBI) Build 33) identified 307 polymorphisms between CAST and B6.

Although great effort was put forth to eliminate non - donor region direct genetic effects, other factors such as maternal genotype ( maternal genotype for each congenic versus control dams differed) and environmental effects could confound our results.

The potential role of Gh would include polymorphism that alters protein function in the absence of Socs2 or that causes transcriptional deregulation of Gh.

Additionally, functional variation in Stat5b may explain the sex - specific phenotypes in HG11 mice since it is the primary transcription factor responsible for Gh induced sex - specific liver gene expression [ 44].

Based on this genetic and in vitro data, we suggest that the plasticity of the bipotential gonad is controlled by mutually antagonistic signals between FGF9 and WNT4 in the gonadal field.

Using an antibody against c - MYC, the expression and nuclear localization of SRYMYC in SryMyc; Fgf9 - / - gonads was indistinguishable from littermate controls ( Figure 2C and 2D).

These data using two different Sry transgenic reporter lines provide evidence that Sry expression is not dependent on Fgf9.

As results indicated that Fgf9 functioned downstream of, or in parallel with Sry, we investigated whether Fgf9 was involved in the up - regulation of Sox9 expression.

For in vitro cell culture, cells were isolated from 11. 5 dpc gonads free of mesonephroi, and cultured on extracellular matrix - coated coverslips with or without addition of purified FGF9 in culture media.

To explain the difference between experimental results from dissociated XX gonadal cells and XX gonads, we reasoned that the local concentrations of FGF9 might not be high enough to override blocking signals in the intact XX gonad, or that active FGF9 was not efficiently localized or presented in the extracellular matrix of the XX gonad.

In wild - type and heterozygous mutant XY gonads at 11. 5 dpc, SOX9 was detected in a small number of cells in the gonad ( Figure 3A).

Notably, in Fgf9 - / - XY gonads, SOX9 was no longer detectable by 12. 5 dpc, and Sertoli precursor cells never began to organize into normal testis cord structures ( Figure 3F).	"Fgf9	12	16	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"SOX9	34	38	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Sertoli	82	89	Cell"	"cells	100	105	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Fgf9"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""SOX9"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Sertoli"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Because Sox9 acts as a positive regulator of Fgf9 expression, we questioned whether cell proliferation in XY gonads was also compromised by the loss of Sox9.

The residual level of Amh suggested that the transient expression of SOX9 in Fgf9 - / - gonads at 11. 5 dpc was sufficient to activate Amh, a direct downstream target.

At 12. 5 dpc Wnt4 was up - regulated in XY Fgf9 - / - but not in XY Fgf9 + / - gonad controls ( Figure 4I - 4K).

We reasoned that if FGF9 and WNT4 do act as opposing signals, then reduction in the dose of Wnt4 might render the XX gonad more susceptible to the male - promoting effects of exogenous FGF9.

This finding was confirmed by mRNA in situ hybridization, which also detected Sox9 transcripts in 11. 5 dpc Wnt4 - / - XX gonads ( Figure S1).

[ 47] showed that misexpression of Fgf9 in chick nephrogenous mesenchyme led to the expansion of gonadal marker gene expression, implicating Fgf9 in gonadal cell proliferation across species.

We provide proof - of - concept for this at the p53 locus, by showing efficient targeting in fibroblasts, and rapid phenotypic read - out of a recessive mutation after a single exchange.

In addition, RMCE - ASAP could be used to generate fibroblastic cell lines tailored for the repeated targeting of widely studied genes ( p53, c - myc, NF - KB, etc.).

Importantly RMCE - ASAP incorporates two major improvements over classical RMCE ( path B): ( i) the positive / negative selection cassette does not prevent germline transmission, so that RMCE - ready mice can be obtained; ( ii) the selection cassette does not replace, but rather lies downstream of the GOI.

This is a crucial requirement for accelerated phenotyping in somatic cells, as maintaining a functional GOI ensures that the RMCE - ready locus still behaves like a WT locus.

Yet, the significance of these interactions with RanBP2 and the genetic and physiological role ( s) of RanBP2 in a whole - animal model remain elusive.

RanBP2 - / - are embryonically lethal, and haploinsufficiency of RanBP2 in an inbred strain causes a pronounced decrease of HKI and ATP levels selectively in the central nervous system.	"RanBP2	0	6	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"RanBP2	65	71	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"HKI	124	127	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"ATP	132	135	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""RanBP2"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 6, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""RanBP2"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""HKI"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""ATP"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Hence, RanBP2 and its partners emerge as critical modulators of neuronal HKI, glucose catabolism, energy homeostasis, and targets for metabolic, aging disorders and allied neuropathies.

Still, the genetic and physiological implications of the interactions between RanBP2 and its partners and of the function of RanBP2 in a whole - animal model remain elusive.

On the other hand, the cell ( tissue) - selective interaction of RanBP2 with some of its partners may also impart cell - restricted roles to RanBP2.

A diverse set of additional molecular partners, each associating specifically with a selective domain of RanBP2, are likely to impart and integrate additional roles to RanBP2.

Parkin is ubiquitously expressed and interacts with the Ubc9 - interacting domain of RanBP2 [ 20].

This promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of RanBP2 [ 20], possibly via the interaction of the CLD domain of RanBP2 with the 19S cap subunits of the proteasome [ 14].

Parkin, like RanBP2 [ 17], has E3 - ligase activity [ 22 - 24]; and loss - of - function of parkin leads to early onset autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinsonism [ 25].

The LD of RanBP2 ( Figure 1A) is a large and orphan domain of ~ 700 residues ( ~ 80 kDa), for which no molecular partners have been identified until this date.

Moreover, glucose is the sole reliance source of energy in the CNS under normal conditions, the CNS lacks glucose storage sources, and despite the disproportionate mass of the CNS to the rest of the body, the CNS consumes daily about 60% of the body ' s glucose and 25% of the total oxygen [ 35, 36].

In contrast, in Alk2 / Wnt1 - Cre mutants a sizeable septal mesenchyme could be seen, still without any obvious looping of the aortic sac and truncal OFT, suggesting that the mere presence of the septal mesenchyme, without correct smooth muscle cell differentiation, is not sufficient for OFT rotation.

If indeed the long - range effects of SHH are indirectly mediated by local production of secondary signals, the leading candidates have been two members of the BMP family, BMP2 and BMP7.	"SHH	38	41	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP	160	163	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP2	172	176	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP7	181	185	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""SHH"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 160, ""end_span"": 163, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 172, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP7"", ""start_span"": 181, ""end_span"": 185, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
BMP2 [ 8] and BMP7 [ 7] can be induced by ectopic SHH and their expression is greatly diminished in the absence of SHH activity [ 9].	"BMP2	0	4	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP7	14	18	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"SHH	50	53	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"SHH	115	118	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP7"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""SHH"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""SHH"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In addition to BMP2 and BMP7, a third member of this family that is closely related to BMP2, BMP4, is also expressed in the early limb bud.	"BMP2	15	19	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP7	24	28	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP2	87	91	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	93	97	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP7"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, all three of these molecules, BMP2, BMP4, and BMP7, have been suggested to act in a second distinct phase of limb patterning, when digit identities are established downstream of earlier patterning events.	"molecules	28	37	Chemical"	"BMP2	39	43	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	45	49	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP7	55	59	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""molecules"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP7"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In the light of these observations, it would seem unlikely that quantitative differences in levels of interdigital BMP signal are responsible for establishing digit identity, although redundancy between BMP2, BMP4, and BMP7 in this role remains a possibility.	"BMP	115	118	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP2	203	207	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	209	213	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP7	219	223	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 203, ""end_span"": 207, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 209, ""end_span"": 213, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP7"", ""start_span"": 219, ""end_span"": 223, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
At later stages, the combined activity of neither BMP2 and BMP4 nor of BMP2 and BMP7 is required for chondrogenesis.	"BMP2	50	54	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	59	63	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP2	71	75	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP7	80	84	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP7"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We verified the ability of Prx1:: cre to recombine the conditional Bmp2 and Bmp4 alleles at earliest limb bud stages using in situ hybridization.	"Prx1	27	31	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Bmp2	67	71	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Bmp4	76	80	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"alleles	81	88	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Prx1"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Bmp2"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Bmp4"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""alleles"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
By the time its expression is first detectable, the floxed Bmp2 allele appears to be completely recombined in the limb mesenchyme, as whole mount in situ hybridization does not detect any mesenchymal Bmp2 transcription ( Figure 1B).	"floxed	52	58	Sequence"	"Bmp2	59	63	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"allele	64	70	Sequence"	"Bmp2	200	204	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""floxed"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Bmp2"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""allele"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Bmp2"", ""start_span"": 200, ""end_span"": 204, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Simultaneous removal of BMP2 and BMP7 had far less of an effect than did removal of BMP2 and BMP4 activity.	"BMP2	24	28	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP7	33	37	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP2	84	88	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	93	97	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP7"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In limbs developing in the complete absence of both BMP7 and BMP2 activity ( Bmp2C / C, Bmp7 - / -; Prx1:: cre), the last phalanx was missing from digit III in the forelimb, and these limbs displayed the same phenotype in the hindlimb with variable penetrance ( Figure 1L and 1T, black arrow).	"BMP7	52	56	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP2	61	65	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Bmp7	88	92	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Prx1	100	104	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP7"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Bmp7"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Prx1"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, one of the striking defects observed in the Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre mice is that in the newborn animals, the digits of both forelimb ( unpublished data) and hindlimb show complete syndactyly ( Figure 2D; compare to wild - type, Figure 2C).	"Prx1	75	79	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	86	90	Organism"	"animals	114	121	Organism"	"wild - type	233	244	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Prx1"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""wild - type"", ""start_span"": 233, ""end_span"": 244, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
The one dramatic patterning defect we observed in our BMP deficiency series was the loss of posterior digits in forelimbs deficient in both BMP2 and BMP4 ( Figure 1K), also observed in earlier limb buds stained to show no expression of the condensation marker Sox9 ( Figure 3).	"BMP	54	57	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP2	140	144	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	149	153	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Sox9	260	264	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 149, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Sox9"", ""start_span"": 260, ""end_span"": 264, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In wild - type limb buds the condensation of all five digits can be visualized at this stage by in situ hybridization with a probe directed against Sox9, the earliest known chondrogenic marker ( Figure 3I).

Genes such as Msx2 ( Figure 3N) continue to be expressed throughout the posterior forelimb mesenchyme, indicating that the posterior forelimb tissue is viable at E12. 5 in the Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre animals.

The hypertrophic cells in BMP2, BMP4 - deficient limb also express late hypertrophic markers, such as osteopontin [ 42] ( unpublished data).	"cells	17	22	Cell"	"BMP2	26	30	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	32	36	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"osteopontin	102	113	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""osteopontin"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
As can be seen in sagittal sections through an E15. 5 humerus, the cells embedded in the mineralized matrix express the osteoblast marker Col I as normal ( Figure 5C and 5D).	"cells	67	72	Cell"	"matrix	101	107	GO_ontology"	"osteoblast	120	130	Cell"	"Col I	138	143	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""matrix"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""osteoblast"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Col I"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
While vascularization occurs in Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre forelimbs, few osteoclasts are recruited to the mineralized cartilage ( compare Figure 5G and Figure 5H, red arrows), resulting in a delay in bone marrow cavity formation in the absence of BMP2 and BMP4.	"Prx1	54	58	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"osteoclasts	80	91	Cell"	"BMP2	254	258	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	263	267	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Prx1"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""osteoclasts"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 254, ""end_span"": 258, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 263, ""end_span"": 267, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
To determine if any osteoblast differentiation occurs in Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre forelimbs, we examined osteoblast - related gene expression ( Figure 7).	"osteoblast	20	30	Cell"	"Prx1	79	83	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"osteoblast	113	123	Cell"	"gene	134	138	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""osteoblast"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Prx1"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""osteoblast"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""gene"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
In the absence of BMP2 and BMP4, cells which are fibroblastic in appearance ( Figure 6H) are found adjacent to the mineralized cartilage surfaces.	"BMP2	18	22	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	27	31	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cells	33	38	Cell"	"fibroblastic	49	61	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""fibroblastic"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We have also shown that chondrogenesis can be initiated and chondrogenic differentiation will take place even in the absence of both BMP2 and BMP4 or BMP2 and BMP7.	"BMP2	133	137	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	142	146	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP2	150	154	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP7	159	163	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP7"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 163, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In considering potential secondary signals mediating ZPA activity, the most relevant family member to consider is BMP7 as, like BMP2 ( and unlike BMP4), it is positively regulated by SHH signaling [ 7].	"BMP7	114	118	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP2	128	132	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	146	150	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"SHH	183	186	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP7"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""SHH"", ""start_span"": 183, ""end_span"": 186, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, increasing BMP concentrations interdigitally with exogenous protein does not result in the reciprocal posterior transformations, and the noggin experiments can also be interpreted simply as a block in the condensation of the primordia of distal phalanges when BMP activity is completely abolished [ 38].	"BMP	20	23	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"protein	69	76	Chemical"	"noggin	146	152	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP	269	272	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""noggin"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 269, ""end_span"": 272, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This is not what is observed, either in limbs deficient in both BMP2 and BMP4 or in those deficient in BMP2 and BMP7.	"BMP2	64	68	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	73	77	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP2	103	107	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP7	112	116	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP7"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The difference is that the mice analyzed in the previous report had one null allele and one conditional allele, while ours had two conditional alleles.	"mice	27	31	Organism"	"allele	77	83	Sequence"	"allele	104	110	Sequence"	"alleles	143	150	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""allele"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""allele"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""alleles"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Their mice, therefore, lost a half - dose of BMP4 from the AER in addition to complete loss in the mesenchyme, while our conditional alleles were only recombined in the mesenchyme by the Prx1:: cre driver.

However, once chondrogenesis begins, cartilage differentiation can be sustained, albeit with some detectable delay, in the absence of BMP2 and BMP4 or in the absence of BMP2 and BMP7.

At E13. 5, the Pygo2 gene appeared to play a major role, and the Pygo1 gene a minor role, in canonical Wnt signaling in the ureteric tree, as measured by BAT - gal expression.

In order to validate and quantify the BAT - gal reporter expression changes in the Pygo2 null and Pygo1 / Pygo2 nulls, we performed ELISA measurements of transgene specific beta - galactosidase levels in E18. 5 kidneys ( Figure 7).

Whereas the BAT - gal transgene reporter monitors the response of one promoter to Wnt signaling, microarrays can be used to follow expression changes of all genes, including all known Wnt targets.

One possible explanation of these unexpected results is a failure of the gene targeting to eliminate functioning of the Pygo1 and Pygo2 genes.

Whereas the BAT - gal transgene reporter monitors the expression level of only one Wnt responsive promoter, the microarray allows the analysis of the activity levels of promoters of all genes.

Assuming that the Pygopus genes in mammals are dedicated to canonical Wnt signaling, as has been previously shown in Drosophila, the genes with expression differences represent candidate Wnt targets ( direct or indirect) in kidney development.

In this paper, we investigate the function of the Dmrt7 gene, one of seven related genes in the mouse.

We find that DMRT7 protein is present in germ cells, localizes to the male XY body during meiosis, and is essential for male but not female fertility.

For example, there is a higher failure rate for meiosis in females, with human oocyte aneuploidy rates up to 25% versus about 2% in human sperm [ 3], and this may indicate that the checkpoints controlling and monitoring the events of meiotic progression in males are more stringent.

This maintenance of silencing is associated with a distinct set of chromatin marks that define a sex chromatin domain termed postmeiotic sex chromatin ( PMSC) [ 16, 17].

Vertebrates also have DM domain genes, and analysis to date, although limited, has shown that these genes also control sexual differentiation.

Female mice mutant in Dmrt4 have polyovular follicles, indicating that this gene also plays a role in gonadal development [ 32].

Dmrt7 is expressed only in the gonad, and, unlike the other Dmrt genes, appears to be present exclusively in mammals and not in nonmammalian vertebrates [ 23, 36].

Our previous mRNA expression analysis suggested a possible meiotic function for Dmrt7, based on the expression of Dmrt7 mRNA in the fetal gonads of the two sexes [ 23].

Because this earlier work did not examine adult Dmrt7 expression, we first performed reverse transcriptase ( RT) - PCR on mRNA from ten adult organs and detected strong Dmrt7 mRNA expression in the testis and a trace of expression in heart, but not in any other tissue tested ( Figure 1A).	"Dmrt7	48	53	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mRNA	122	126	Chemical"	"Dmrt7	169	174	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mRNA	175	179	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Dmrt7"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mRNA"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""Dmrt7"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mRNA"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 179, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
cDNA from each organ was amplified with primers specific for Dmrt7 ( top row) and beta - actin ( bottom row).

To more precisely determine the pachytene stages of DMRT7 expression, we double - stained with an antibody to GATA1, which is expressed in Sertoli cells from stages VII to IX [ 38].

DMRT7 also is specifically localized in sperm, with antibody staining mainly in the perinuclear ring of the sperm head manchette.

To determine when defective testis development begins in Dmrt7 mutants, we compared the testes of wild - type and mutant littermates during the first wave of spermatogenesis.

Prior to postnatal day 14 ( P14), mutant testes appeared histologically normal and the testis weights were similar to those of heterozygous and wild - type littermates, indicating that spermatogonia and early meiotic germ cells form normally ( Figure 2B; unpublished data).

Microscopic examination of P21 and P42 Dmrt7 mutant testes revealed that germ cells arrest in pachynema, and later stages of germ cells are largely missing ( Figure 2C and 2D).

In addition, some tubules contain multinucleated cells and cells with darkly stained nuclei that are typical of apoptotic cells ( Figure 2D).

Since Dmrt7 mutant testes lack most post - pachytene cells, we used TUNEL analysis to test whether the missing cells are eliminated by apoptosis.

At 3 wk, Dmrt7 mutant testes contain significantly more apoptotic cells than those of wild - type controls.

The percentage of tubule sections with five or more apoptotic nuclei was about three times higher in Dmrt7 mutants compared with wild - type ( 20% versus 7%; Figure 2E).

To better define the spermatogenic stage at which Dmrt7 - / - male germ cells arrest and die, we used antibodies against several stage - specific germ cell markers.

Dmrt7 mutant testes had BC7 - positive cells in approximately normal numbers, but again abnormally organized, with many positive cells in the center rather than the periphery of the tubules ( Figure 3B).

We found that Dmrt7 mutants accumulate pachytene cells but have greatly reduced numbers of cells in late - pachynema and beyond.

Likewise, the Dmrt7 mutant zygotene spermatocytes showed normal accumulation of the early recombination repair marker RAD51, suggesting that early meiotic recombination is not significantly affected ( Figure 5B).

The data presented so far indicate that Dmrt7 mutant germ cells undergo apparently normal early meiosis and then arrest during pachynema due to a strict requirement for Dmrt7 in the germ line.	"Dmrt7	40	45	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutant	46	52	Sequence"	"germ cells	53	63	Cell"	"Dmrt7	169	174	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Dmrt7"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""germ cells"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Dmrt7"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We first asked whether DMRT7 is required for XY body formation by evaluating several characteristic XY body chromatin features.	"DMRT7	23	28	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"XY body	45	52	GO_ontology"	"XY body chromatin	100	117	GO_ontology"	"features	118	126	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""DMRT7"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""XY body"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""XY body chromatin"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""features"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
SUMO - 1 expression normally increases in the XY body of early - to mid - pachytene spermatocytes at the time of sex chromosome condensation.	"SUMO - 1	0	8	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"XY body	46	53	GO_ontology"	"spermatocytes	84	97	Cell"	"sex chromosome	113	127	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""SUMO - 1"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""XY body"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""spermatocytes"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""sex chromosome"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
However, some tubules in mutants had multiple layers of cells with SUMO - 1 - condensed spots ( Figure 7C), rather than the normal single layer of cells.	"mutants	25	32	Sequence"	"cells	56	61	Cell"	"SUMO - 1	67	75	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cells	147	152	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""mutants"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""SUMO - 1"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This accumulation of XY body - containing cells also was apparent with gamma H2AX staining and is consistent with a developmental arrest of mutant cells in mid - to late - pachytene.	"XY body	21	28	GO_ontology"	"cells	42	47	Cell"	"mutant	140	146	Sequence"	"cells	147	152	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""XY body"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In early - pachytene, Ub - H2A is concentrated in the XY body; by mid - pachytene Ub - H2A is observed throughout the entire nucleus, but it again becomes limited to the XY body in late - pachytene spermatocytes [ 13].

Analysis of nuclear spreads revealed that Ub - H2A localizes normally to the XY body in Dmrt7 mutants ( Figure S4).

Abundant pachytene cells with XY bodies are present in wild - type and mutant testes.

Abnormal Sex Chromatin in Dmrt7 Mutant Germ Cells	"Sex Chromatin	9	22	GO_ontology"	"Dmrt7	26	31	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Mutant	32	38	Sequence"	"Germ Cells	39	49	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Sex Chromatin"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""Dmrt7"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Mutant"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Germ Cells"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We therefore asked whether the pachytene germ cell death in Dmrt7 mutants is associated with a failure either to initiate or to maintain sex chromosome inactivation.	"germ cell	41	50	Cell"	"Dmrt7	60	65	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutants	66	73	Sequence"	"sex chromosome	137	151	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""germ cell"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Dmrt7"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutants"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""sex chromosome"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Rbmy was inactivated normally in pachytene cells of Dmrt7 mutants, based on immunofluorescent staining with an anti - RBMY antibody ( Figure S5).	"cells	43	48	Cell"	"Dmrt7	52	57	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutants	58	65	Sequence"	"antibody	123	131	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Dmrt7"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutants"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""antibody"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
We found that HP1 beta localization is normal in DMRT7 mutant cells in mid - pachynema ( Figure 8C and 8D).	"HP1 beta	14	22	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"DMRT7	49	54	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutant	55	61	Sequence"	"cells	62	67	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""HP1 beta"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""DMRT7"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
These results suggest that XY body formation and initiation of MSCI both occur normally in Dmrt7 mutant germ cells.

HP1 beta localizes to X chromosome centromere ( arrowhead) in wild - type ( C) and mutant ( D).

Mutant cell ( J) lacks strong concentration of this mark to the XY body seen in wild - type ( I).

We also examined three epigenetic signatures of PMSC: histone H3 dimethylated or trimethylated at lysine - 9 ( H3 - 2meK9, H3 - 3meK9) and spreading of HP1 beta through the XY body [ 16, 57, 58] ( S. H. Namekawa, unpublished data).	"histone	54	61	Chemical"	"lysine	98	104	Chemical"	"HP1 beta	152	160	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"XY body	173	180	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""histone"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""lysine"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""HP1 beta"", ""start_span"": 152, ""end_span"": 160, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""XY body"", ""start_span"": 173, ""end_span"": 180, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Similarly, we found Dmrt7 mutant diplotene cells lacking accumulation of H3 - 2meK9 and H3 - 3meK9 marks onto the sex chromatin ( Figure 8I - 8L).	"Dmrt7	20	25	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutant	26	32	Sequence"	"cells	43	48	Cell"	"sex chromatin	114	127	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Dmrt7"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""sex chromatin"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Some of the mutant diplotene cells showing abnormal sex chromatin also had abnormal autosomal gamma H2AX staining ( Figure 8L).	"mutant	12	18	Sequence"	"cells	29	34	Cell"	"sex chromatin	52	65	GO_ontology"	"autosomal	84	93	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""sex chromatin"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""autosomal"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
gamma H2AX localizes to double - strand DNA breaks, so this staining may indicate that some diplotene mutant cells are approaching or entering apoptosis [ 59].	"double - strand	24	39	Sequence"	"DNA	40	43	Sequence"	"mutant	102	108	Sequence"	"cells	109	114	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""double - strand"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""DNA"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In this study, we find that the DM domain protein DMRT7 is required for male germ cells to complete meiotic prophase but is dispensable in the female germ line.	"domain	35	41	Sequence"	"protein	42	49	Chemical"	"DMRT7	50	55	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"male germ cells	72	87	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""domain"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""DMRT7"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""male germ cells"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In males, DMRT7 expression is highest in pachytene spermatocytes, and the protein preferentially localizes to the XY body.	"DMRT7	10	15	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"spermatocytes	51	64	Cell"	"protein	74	81	Chemical"	"XY body	114	121	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""DMRT7"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""spermatocytes"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""XY body"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Examination of chromatin and nascent transcription in mutant cells that progressed to diplonema revealed sex chromatin abnormalities, as discussed below.	"chromatin	15	24	GO_ontology"	"mutant	54	60	Sequence"	"cells	61	66	Cell"	"sex chromatin	105	118	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""chromatin"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""sex chromatin"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
We found that chromosomal synapsis and recombination appear normal in Dmrt7 mutant cells.	"chromosomal	14	25	GO_ontology"	"Dmrt7	70	75	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutant	76	82	Sequence"	"cells	83	88	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""chromosomal"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""Dmrt7"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
First, we tested whether the XY body forms and MSCI is established in Dmrt7 mutant cells.	"XY body	29	36	GO_ontology"	"Dmrt7	70	75	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutant	76	82	Sequence"	"cells	83	88	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""XY body"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""Dmrt7"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Moreover, Cot - 1 hybridization and analysis of RBMY expression demonstrated that MSCI initiates normally in the XY body of mid - pachytene Dmrt7 mutant cells.	"XY body	113	120	GO_ontology"	"Dmrt7	140	145	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutant	146	152	Sequence"	"cells	153	158	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""XY body"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""Dmrt7"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We did, however, observe three specific defects in the sex chromatin of Dmrt7 mutant germ cells that avoided arrest in pachynema and were able to enter diplonema.	"sex chromatin	55	68	GO_ontology"	"Dmrt7	72	77	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutant	78	84	Sequence"	"germ cells	85	95	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""sex chromatin"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""Dmrt7"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""germ cells"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
A proportion of mutant diplotene cells have apparently normal sex chromatin ( for example, Figure 8M); these are likely to be the cells that can progress beyond diplonema.	"mutant	16	22	Sequence"	"cells	33	38	Cell"	"sex chromatin	62	75	GO_ontology"	"cells	130	135	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""sex chromatin"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The reciprocal situation ( sex chromatin defects caused by apoptosis) is possible, but seems unlikely, because we observed mutant cells with sex chromatin defects but no indications of apoptosis.	"sex chromatin	27	40	GO_ontology"	"mutant	123	129	Sequence"	"cells	130	135	Cell"	"sex chromatin	141	154	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""sex chromatin"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""sex chromatin"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
DMRT7 is unusual among XY body proteins in being related to highly site - specific transcriptional regulators.

Another possibility is that TRIP13 is required for disassembly of NCO recombinational repair complexes [ 51] containing those proteins that persist abnormally on Trip13Gt / Gt pachytene chromosomes.
