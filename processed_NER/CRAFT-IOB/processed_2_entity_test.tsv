Previous studies have shown that the alpha - crystallin possesses molecular chaperone activity, binding to partially denatured proteins, both in vitro [ 5] and probably in vivo [ 6], to inhibit further denaturation.

All of these findings raise many questions as to the possible role ( s) of alpha - crystallin in the nucleus and in cell cycle regulation during differentiation.

Actin filament formation has been shown to be necessary for the differentiation of lens epithelial cells [ 15], however, the significance of alpha - crystallin interaction with actin in differentiation is not known.

Although the existence of tripeptidyl - peptidase I ( TPP - I) was first noted over 40 years ago [ 1], the structural and mechanistic basis of its activity has been largely misunderstood until quite recently.

The medical importance of CLN2 and the lack of a crystal structure inspired attempts at protein modeling.

The primary basis of the homology model was the structure of a complex of sedolisin with a covalently - bound inhibitor, pseudo - iodotyrostatin.

Another reason for the modeling of a pseudo - iodotyrostatin complex is that CLN2 is a tripeptidase, and that this inhibitor it represents the only experimental structure of a tripeptide analog bound to sedolisin.

Another wall of the pocket is made up of the main chain of residues 130 - 132 that flank the conserved Gly131.

There is also no equivalent to the polar interaction between Glu175 and Glu171 in sedolisin, since the equivalent of the latter residue in CLN2 is Ser166, much smaller and pointing away.	"residue	128	135	Chemical"	"CLN2	139	143	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""residue"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""CLN2"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The side of the S1 pocket that is created by the very flexible side chain of Arg179 in sedolisin contains only a much smaller Ser174 in CLN2, and thus is much more open in the latter protein.

In summary, the S1 pocket in CLN2 has less polar character than the equivalent pocket in the related proteins, and is lacking direct polar anchors for any side chains that might be present in the substrate.

The S2 pocket in CLN2 is also quite open and accessible to solvent.

It is most likely larger than the equivalent pockets in either sedolisin or kumamolisin, since these are limited by Trp81 in the former and Trp129 in the latter ( these residues originate from different parts of the backbone in the two enzymes and are not topologically related).

The location of the P3 side chain of the substrate is ambiguous, since it could point in either one of two directions by exchange with the N - terminal amine.

Since a major component of such bodies appears to be intact subunit c of mitochondrial ATP synthase, this protein has been implicated as a potential biological target of the protease.

It has been shown recently that CLN2 can indeed degrade this subunit on its N terminus [ 18], but the unambiguous proof that this is indeed the most important target is still lacking.

Again, however, all of these tripeptides can be easily accommodated in the substrate - binding site of the CLN2 model.

Analysis of the model of CLN2 suggests that the size of the S1 subsite is much larger than in either sedolisin or kumamolisin, and thus the use of a large P1 group might be indicated.

Of course, the availability of an experimental crystal structure will make the design of inhibitors easier and we are continuing our efforts to crystallize CLN2 from different sources.

The model of human CLN2 was built using the structure of sedolisin complexed with the inhibitor pseudo - tyrostatin [ 5, 6] as a template.

This was first accomplished automatically by the two computer packages, then manually adjusted in the Quanta molecular modeling package ( Accelrys, Inc.) to better mimic the templates and optimize the interactions with surrounding residues.

Fortunately, these problematic loops will not significantly affect the active site of the model, since only two of them impinge on the boundary of this highly conserved, functional region.

Although spontaneous autoimmunity has not been documented in either of the pure 129 or C57BL / 6 strains, a spontaneous lupus - like phenotype has been described in ( 129 x C57BL / 6) hybrid strains ( Obata et al. 1979; Botto et al. 1998; Bickerstaff et al. 1999; Santiago - Raber et al. 2001), suggesting that the predisposition in these hybrid mice may arise as a result of the interaction between specific combinations of alleles inherited from both the 129 and C57BL / 6 parental strains.

On the basis of these observations, it was postulated that Apcs, by altering the clearance of chromatin, contributes to the pathogenesis of SLE.

We carefully investigated whether Ptdsr is expressed from E10. 5 to E12. 5 in the developing kidney and lungs, but no expression could be detected indicating that Ptdsr expression is required only at later stages in the development of these organs ( see below).

Ptdsr - / - lungs showed, in comparison to wild - type, only a slight delay in maturation and were fully ventilated in neonates in most cases ( Figure 3e, k).

By gross morphology we could differentiate two classes of Ptdsr mutants: those that appeared normal with both eyes present ( Figure 4) and those that were severely affected and displayed uni - or bilateral anophthalmia ( Figure 5).

No differences in accumulation of TUNEL - positive cell corpses were observed between the two genotypes ( Figure 6a).

Tissue restructuring by programmed cell death occurred most notably within the ventral part of the neural tube ( Figure 6b, f) and in the developing paravertebral ganglia ( Figure 6d, h) with many apoptotic cells being present.

Furthermore, we were unable to detect any evidence of tissue necrosis in lungs from Ptdsr - deficient mice.

Surprisingly, there was no co - localization of macrophages with apoptotic cells.

In virtually all embryonic tissues, apoptotic cells and macrophages were localized in different compartments ( Figure 6e, 6i; and see also Additional data file 1, Figure S1).	"apoptotic cells	36	51	Cell"	"macrophages	56	67	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Ptdsr - deficiency results in reduced production of pro - and anti - inflammatory cytokines after macrophage stimulation	"Ptdsr	0	5	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"macrophage	98	108	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""macrophage"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Similar results were obtained when other pro - inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin - 6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein - 1, were analyzed ( data not shown).	"interleukin - 6	79	94	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"monocyte chemoattractant protein - 1	99	135	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""interleukin - 6"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""monocyte chemoattractant protein - 1"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
While this work was in progress, two other groups reported the generation of Ptdsr - deficient mice [ 31, 32].	"Ptdsr	77	82	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	95	99	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In our case, the Ptdsr - null allele was generated in an isogenic C57BL / 6J background, whereas Li et al.	"Ptdsr	17	22	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"allele	30	36	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""allele"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
[ 32] investigated the phenotype of their Ptdsr - knockout mice in a mixed 129 x C57BL / 6 background.	"Ptdsr	42	47	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	59	63	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This ' recovery ' was most visible in Ptdsr - / - lungs: at P0 we found expanded lungs in the knockout mice that showed normal branching patterns, with differentiated alveoli and bronchioles.	"Ptdsr	38	43	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	103	107	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The frequently observed subcutaneous edema of various extents in Ptdsr - deficient homozygotes gave us a hint that Ptdsr - deficiency and lethality might be associated with cardiovascular problems.	"Ptdsr	65	70	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Ptdsr	115	120	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Indeed, very recently we have obtained strong evidence that Ptdsr - knockout mice die as a result of defects in heart development that are associated with specific cardiopulmonary malformations; ( J. E. Schneider, J. B., S. D. Bamfort, A. D. G., C. Broadbent, K. Clarke, S. Neubauer, A. L. and S. Battacharya, unpublished observations).	"Ptdsr	60	65	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	77	81	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In addition, we demonstrate that eye development requires a functional Ptdsr gene.	"Ptdsr	71	76	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"gene	77	81	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""gene"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
This phenotype represents a completely novel lesion that to our knowledge has not been described before in any other mouse mutant.	"mouse	117	122	Organism"	"mutant	123	129	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
A possible explanation for these two phenotypes can be found in the expression pattern of the Ptdsr gene.	"Ptdsr	94	99	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"gene	100	104	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""gene"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Interestingly, we occasionally observed serious malformations of forebrain and nasal structures in Ptdsr - knockout embryos that were associated with bilateral anophthalmia ( see for example the mutant embryo in Figure 1g).	"Ptdsr	99	104	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutant	195	201	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 195, ""end_span"": 201, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
This suggests that Ptdsr is involved in the regulation of differentiation processes within forebrain regions, and that ablation of Ptdsr function might secondarily affect early eye formation.	"Ptdsr	19	24	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Ptdsr	131	136	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Li et al. proposed [ 31] that the eye phenotype they observed could be explained by failed removal of apoptotic cells during eye development, but we think that the observed defects are unrelated to a failure of apoptotic cell clearance.	"apoptotic cells	102	117	Cell"	"apoptotic cell	211	225	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cell"", ""start_span"": 211, ""end_span"": 225, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
A recent comprehensive kinetic analysis of apoptosis induction during mouse retinal development described four major peaks of apoptotic cell death [ 42].	"mouse	70	75	Organism"	"apoptotic cell	126	140	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cell"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Thus, besides the formation of the inner and outer layers of the optic cup in early eye development, other major phases of retinal cell apoptosis take place only postnatally and correspond to important periods in the establishment of neuronal connections.	"cell	131	135	Cell"	"neuronal	234	242	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 234, ""end_span"": 242, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
[ 31], we found particular brain malformations in our Ptdsr - / - mice.	"Ptdsr	54	59	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	66	70	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Thus, reduced cell death or diminished clearance of apoptotic neural progenitor cells is unlikely to be the cause of the brain hyperplasia.	"cell	14	18	Cell"	"apoptotic neural progenitor cells	52	85	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic neural progenitor cells"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The multiple defects in tissue differentiation cannot be explained by failure of apoptotic cell clearance, as this process is normal in our Ptdsr - knockout line.	"apoptotic cell	81	95	Cell"	"Ptdsr	140	145	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""apoptotic cell"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Ptdsr is not essential for the clearance of apoptotic cells	"Ptdsr	0	5	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"apoptotic cells	44	59	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Our studies demonstrate that Ptdsr is not a primary receptor for the uptake of apoptotic cells.	"Ptdsr	29	34	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"apoptotic cells	79	94	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
These results are contrary to the expected role of Ptdsr in apoptotic cell clearance and to the reported findings of Li et al.	"Ptdsr	51	56	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"apoptotic cell	60	74	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cell"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
[ 32], as well as to a study done with a phosphatidylserine receptor null allele in C. elegans [ 45].	"phosphatidylserine receptor	41	68	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"allele	74	80	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""phosphatidylserine receptor"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""allele"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
These results must be interpreted very carefully, however, as it is technically difficult to unambiguously identify engulfed target cells in individual macrophages in solid tissues by fluorescence microscopy.	"cells	132	137	Cell"	"macrophages	152	163	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 152, ""end_span"": 163, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Obviously these in vivo clearance mechanisms are not compromised by Ptdsr - deficiency in our knockout mutant.	"Ptdsr	68	73	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutant	103	109	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
The different results obtained in the two studies are puzzling; they might be due to the use of different macrophage or cell populations.	"macrophage	106	116	Cell"	"cell	120	124	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""macrophage"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

It remains to be determined which classical pathways of macrophage activation and function involve Ptdsr.

Most strikingly, the recently published data regarding the genetic ablation or perturbation of phosphatidylserine receptor function in C. elegans are also contradictory.

Interdigital mesenchyme is normally eliminated by apoptosis during embryonic development, a process that can be stimulated by BMP beads, inhibited by Noggin, or blocked by overexpression of dominant - negative BMP receptors ( Garcia - Martinez et al. 1993; Yokouchi et al. 1996; Zou and Niswander 1996; Guha et al. 2002).

Limbs of Gdf5 - Cre / Bmpr1afloxP mutant embryos showed obvious retention of interdigital webbing between the first and second, but not other, digits of E14. 5 forelimbs ( Figure 2A and 2B), a pattern that corresponds to the presence or absence of webbing seen in the adult limb.

The normal histological appearance, staining properties, and marker gene expression patterns suggest that Bmpr1a is not required for the initial formation or specification of articular cartilage.

Although this implies that BMP signaling was defective in multiple cell types, the observed defects were confined to the articular cartilage.

Accelerated cartilage maturation and increased expression of Col10a1 was frequently seen in the chondrocytes underlying the articular erosions ( Figure 6C and 6D, brackets) ( unpublished data).

Local loss of the articular surface could remove this inhibition and lead to a cell - nonautonomous acceleration of maturation in chondrocytes underlying points of articular erosion.

Instead, mutant mice showed histological signs of osteoarthritis, such as fibrillation of the articular surface ( Figure 7).

The overall shape of mutant knee skeletal elements appeared similar to controls, although the fibrocartilaginous meniscus that resides between the femur and tibia appeared much less dense in mutants at E16. 5.

At 7 wk of age the normally domed tibial epiphysis was flattened and depressed in the knees of mutant animals, markedly reducing the distance between the growth plate and articular surface ( Figure 7E and 7H, vertical bar).

While subchondral sclerosis is commonly seen in cases of osteoarthritis, it is unclear in this case whether the sclerosis is mainly a response of bone formation to compensate for decreased articular cartilage, or whether it is the effect of loss of Bmpr1a signaling in some LACZ - positive cells that are also observed in these regions ( unpublished data).

The histological signs of joint arthritis were accompanied by functional impairments in both grasping ability and range of motion in mutant animals.

Previous studies have shown that manipulation of BMP signaling alters interdigital apoptosis during development of the limb, but no experiment has identified a specific member of the BMP signaling pathway that is required for this process ( Yokouchi et al. 1996; Zou and Niswander 1996; Zou et al. 1997; Guha et al. 2002).	"BMP	49	52	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP	183	186	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 183, ""end_span"": 186, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Our new loss - of - function data confirm that BMP signaling is required for interdigital apoptosis and suggests that Bmpr1a is a critical component for mediating this signal.	"BMP	47	50	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Bmpr1a	118	124	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Bmpr1a"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The joint defects associated with multiple components of the BMP pathway provide strong evidence that BMP signaling is required for early stages of joint formation at some anatomical locations.	"BMP	61	64	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP	102	105	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Most joints still form normally when Bmpr1a is knocked out in Gdf5 expression domains.

This system thus provides one of the first strong genetic tests of Bmpr1a function at later stages of joint development.

These results suggest that although proprioceptive axons follow proper trajectories in distal peripheral nerves, they fail to innervate their target muscles in the absence of NT - 3.

NT - 3 Is a Chemoattractant for DRG Axons In Vitro	"NT - 3	0	6	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Axons	36	41	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""NT - 3"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 6, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Axons"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
To test the hypothesis that NT - 3 acts as a chemoattractant for sensory axons, we performed a series of in vitro assays.	"NT - 3	28	34	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"axons	73	78	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""NT - 3"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""axons"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
This attraction was not due to survival support of NT - 3 because Bax null ganglia displayed the same chemoattraction ( Figure 5C; n = 16).	"NT - 3	51	57	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Bax	66	69	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""NT - 3"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Bax"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We repeated the co - culture experiments with DRG explants derived from p75NTR KO mice ( n = 18).	"p75NTR	72	78	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	82	86	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""p75NTR"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Axons of these ganglia also showed strong chemoattraction towards the NT - 3 beads ( Figure 5D).	"Axons	0	5	GO_ontology"	"NT - 3	70	76	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Axons"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""NT - 3"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In the presence of TrkC - Fc the chemoattraction was completely blocked, demonstrating that the effect we see is specific for NT - 3.	"TrkC	19	23	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"NT - 3	126	132	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""TrkC"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""NT - 3"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Next, we set up E13 DRG spinal cord explant cultures using NT - 3 - loaded beads placed at the midline at mid - spinal cord level as an ectopic NT - 3 source ( n = 15).	"NT - 3	59	65	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"NT - 3	144	150	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""NT - 3"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""NT - 3"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
NT - 3 is therefore capable of acting as a chemoattractant for DRG axons.	"NT - 3	0	6	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"axons	67	72	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""NT - 3"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 6, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""axons"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Relatively few studies have implicated NT - 3 as a chemoattractant agent for sensory and motor axons.	"NT - 3	39	45	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"axons	95	100	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""NT - 3"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""axons"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
( 2001) showed that developing sensory and motor axons in limb slice cultures preferentially grow towards neurotrophin - soaked beads instead of following their normal trajectories.	"axons	49	54	GO_ontology"	"neurotrophin	106	118	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""axons"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""neurotrophin"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, it is unclear whether NT - 3 is absent from the ventral spinal cords of these animals.	"NT - 3	31	37	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"animals	87	94	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""NT - 3"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The possibility has been raised that motor neurons may retrogradely transport NT - 3 in muscle to the spinal cord ( Chen and Frank 1999).	"motor neurons	37	50	Cell"	"NT - 3	78	84	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""motor neurons"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""NT - 3"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Assays to determine whether any NT - 3 is present in the ventral horns of these mice would be informative.	"NT - 3	32	38	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	80	84	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""NT - 3"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Altogether, our findings suggest a role for NT - 3 in initiation of muscle innervation and spindle differentiation by the proprioceptive axons.	"NT - 3	44	50	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"axons	137	142	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""NT - 3"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""axons"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
( 2003) examined DiI - labeled central DRG axons in the spinal cord of three E17 and two P0 cases, and report that central proprioceptive axons stop in the intermediate laminae, never entering the ventral cord.	"axons	43	48	GO_ontology"	"axons	138	143	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""axons"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""axons"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
We have also seen cases similar to theirs ( n = 4), but at higher magnification these axons did not have terminal boutons and were not completely labeled.	"axons	86	91	GO_ontology"	"terminal boutons	105	121	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""axons"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""terminal boutons"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
However, with complete fills ( n = 5), it was possible to trace these axons into the ventral midline and across to the contralateral side, and visualize terminal boutons at their tips ( see Figure 3C).	"axons	70	75	GO_ontology"	"terminal boutons	153	169	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""axons"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""terminal boutons"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 169, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
They provide evidence that NT - 3 induces Er81 expression in DRG explants in vitro.	"NT - 3	27	33	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Er81	42	46	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""NT - 3"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Er81"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
( 2003) also present observations from islet2DTA mice, which lack a significant portion of the motor neurons in the ventral cord.	"mice	49	53	Organism"	"motor neurons	95	108	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""motor neurons"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Finally, in culture assays, we see a strong chemoattraction of DRG neurons to localized sources of NT - 3.	"neurons	67	74	Cell"	"NT - 3	99	105	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""NT - 3"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Furthermore, in vitro, sensory axon response to NT - 3 does not appear to be dose - dependent ( Ringstedt et al. 1997; Tucker et al. 2001).	"axon	31	35	GO_ontology"	"NT - 3	48	54	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""axon"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""NT - 3"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Along the monosynaptic stretch reflex pathway, only Wnt - 3 has been implicated as an axon arborization factor in the spinal cord ( Krylova et al. 2002).	"Wnt - 3	52	59	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"axon	86	90	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Wnt - 3"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""axon"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
DRG neurons express Robo receptors, which bind to Slits, and proprioceptive axons are therefore capable of responding to Slit signals ( Wang et al. 1999).	"neurons	4	11	Cell"	"axons	76	81	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""axons"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Thus, Slit2 might also be involved in terminal branching of propioceptive axons in the ventral cord and in the midline branching observed in our double KOs.

This suggests that Mcm4 / 6 / 7 may bind to a replication bubble substrate with a 2 - fold symmetry as a double hexamer ( Figure 1A, see the lower scheme), in a manner similar to SV40 T - antigen ( 21).

The amounts of double hexamer complexes increased on Bub - T40 and Bub - T50 with concomitant decrease of single hexamer complexes ( Figure 2A).

However, we did not detect such intermediates during the course of the experiment ( Figure 3B), suggesting that bubble can be displaced efficiently only when two molecules of the Mcm4 / 6 / 7 hexamers are simultaneously activated.

This is in sharp contrast to yeast Mcm4 / 6 / 7 helicases which are not capable of unwinding 3 ' - extension substrates.

Furthermore, dT - tailed 5 ' - extension, to which Mcm4 / 6 / 7 could bind, was not displaced by the Mcm helicase.

Due to its low processivity, Mcm4 / 6 / 7 barely displaced the annealed 37mer oligonucleotide without a 3 ' - tail ( 37mer; Figure 6A).

Therefore, we have examined this hypothesis, by monitoring the expression of genes that determine normal embryonic patterning and morphogenesis in Hdhex4 / 5 / Hdhex4 / 5 huntingtin deficient embryos.

Otx2, normally expressed in the anterior neuroectoderm and anterior visceral endoderm [ 19], is expressed in mutant embryos at E7. 5 ( Fig. 1A, B) although the expression domain appears reduced.

Similarly, Hesx1 expression is grossly normal in mutant embryos, with expression localized to the AVE and neuroectoderm ( Fig. 1C - F, [ 20]), although the expression domain also appears reduced.

Asymmetrical expression of Hesx in mutant embryos ( F) suggests that left - right transcriptional control is maintained.

Hnf3 beta expression in the definitive endoderm extends around the distal tip and is reduced in the AVE ( *) in both normal ( G, I) and mutant embryos ( H, J).	"Hnf3 beta	0	9	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutant	136	142	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Hnf3 beta"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
In wild - type embryos, Hnf3 beta expression is confined to the node and anterior definitive endoderm ( Fig. 1G, I [ 21]).

Mutant embryos exhibit Hnf3 beta - reactive definitive endoderm over the disorganized anterior streak region and proceeding rostrally around the distal tip ( Fig. 1H, J).

Therefore, huntingtin deficiency does not greatly affect Hnf3 beta regulation or the reorganization of the visceral endoderm.

However, close inspection of the data reveals abnormal patterning within this tissue and its derivatives. T, normally expressed in the primitive streak, node and axial head process / notochord mesoderm [ 22], is detected in the shortened streak and axial mesoderm in Hdhex4 / 5 / Hdhex4 / 5 embryos, extending rostrally from a region of weakly positive cells ( Fig. 2A, B).

T expression appears weaker, however, in the anterior streak, corresponding to cells that will give rise to axial mesoderm ( Fig. 2D).

T is also ectopically expressed in mutant extraembryonic mesoderm at the anterior embryonic junction and along the chorion ( Fig. 2B, D).

Similarly, Evx1, normally expressed in primitive streak mesoderm at E7. 5 with highest levels in proximal cells [ 23], is expressed in the proximal shortened streak but is also aberrantly expressed throughout the extraembryonic mesoderm, allantois and chorion ( Fig. 2E, F).

Rather than a node, mutant embryos exhibit a region of disorganized cells ( *) at the distal extent of the short primitive streak.

Therefore we examined paraxial mesoderm formation in wild - type and mutant embryos, revealing deficits in mesoderm patterning.

Starting at E. 7. 5, Wnt3A is expressed in the primitive streak in cells fated to become paraxial mesoderm.

Reduced expression of Tbx6 in the mesoderm lateral to the primitive streak in mutant embryos confirms this interpretation ( Fig. 2I, J).

Notably, heterozygous loss of nodal does not alter the Hdhex4 / 5 / Hdhex4 / 5 phenotype, as determined by morphology of Hdhex4 / 5 / Hdhex4 / 5: Ndllacz / Ndl + embryos compared with Hdhex4 / 5 / Hdhex4 / 5 embryos ( data not shown).

X - gal staining of Nodal - LacZ embryos shows staining in endoderm near the node of normal embryos ( A, C) but broad staining in mutant embryos ( B, D), although expression is higher in the posterior.

Whole mount and in situ hybridization of E7. 5 day embryos reveals that Fgf8 is detected in the proximal streak and is downregulated in cells migrating out of the streak in normal embryos ( E, G).

In contrast, Fgf8 remains highly expressed in mutant embryos ( F, H).

Earlier posterior expression of Gsc is also maintained in mutant embryos ( J) while it is down - regulated in normal embryos ( I).

Fgf8 signaling is also essential for normal gastrulation in the mouse embryo.

Expressed just prior to streak formation in the posterior epiblast and visceral endoderm, Fgf8 is restricted to the streak mesoderm at E7. 5 in a decreasing proximal - distal gradient and is downregulated in cells shortly after they exit the streak ( Fig. 3E, G).

Hdhex4 / 5 / Hdhex4 / 5 embryos also fail to restrict the expression of goosecoid ( Gsc).

At E7. 5, Hnf4 is expressed in the columnar visceral endoderm cells at the extraembryonic - ectoderm junction ( Fig. 4A, [ 33]).

However, Pem expressing visceral endoderm hangs over the anterior of the mutant embryos, revealing abnormal location despite grossly normal differentiation.

Hnf4, expressed in the visceral endoderm at the junction of embryonic - ectoderm junction ( A), is normal in mutant embryos, although the signal is slightly higher ( B).

Wild - type E7. 5 embryos, when cultured in 75% rat serum, develop somites ( M), heart ( white arrow, N) and head folds ( blue arrow head, N) in culture.

Bmp4 is a signaling molecule that is first expressed uniformly throughout the extraembryonic ectoderm and subsequently is localized to a ring of extraembryonic ectoderm adjacent to the epiblast ( Fig. 4E, [ 36]).

However, Dkk - 1 levels appear to be slightly increased in Hdhex4 / 5 / Hdhex4 / 5 embryos, although the pattern of Dkk - 1 expression remains unchanged and this increase may just reflect the same amount of expression in a smaller area.

These results strongly suggest that in the absence of huntingtin, embryos are unable to undergo organogenesis, even if they continue to live past E7. 5 in a nutrient rich environment.

In pursuing the finding that huntingtin is needed only in extraembryonic tissues for normal gastrulation, our data fail to provide evidence of abnormal nutritive gene expression in Hdhex4 / 5 / Hdhex4 / 5 embryos.

This strongly suggests that in huntingtin deficient embryos, the migration of the distal streak derivatives to the extraembryonic mesoderm occurs normally but that the down - regulation of these genes is impaired.	"huntingtin	31	41	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"genes	195	200	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""huntingtin"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 195, ""end_span"": 200, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
The requirement for huntingtin in the extraembryonic tissues had prompted us to test whether impaired extraembryonic signals might be responsible for the dysregulation of gene expression within the epiblast that is observed in Hdhex4 / 5 / Hdhex4 / 5 embryos.	"huntingtin	20	30	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"gene	171	175	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""huntingtin"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""gene"", ""start_span"": 171, ""end_span"": 175, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Both Nodal and Fgf8, important growth factors required for normal development of the epiblast, are tightly regulated during gastrulation.

Therefore, misexpression of either or both of these factors, or of goosecoid, in the visceral endoderm could contribute to the Hdhex4 / 5 / Hdhex4 / 5 mutant phenotype.

Huntingtin deficient embryos also fail to form headfolds, and to undergo organogenesis, even after culturing in nutrient rich media.

Our findings indicate that huntingtin is required for proper patterning of the epiblast during early embryogenesis, for proper anterior streak and node formation, primitive streak progression, paraxial mesoderm and head fold formation, as well as for the proper restriction of transiently expressed growth and transcription factor genes.

We found distended kidneys in all Aqp2F204V / F204V mice; however, the degree of inflation was variable in affected mice and worsened with age.

As shown previously [ 18, 22], immunoblotting revealed three different forms of AQP2, due to different degrees and forms of glycosylation ( Figure 3A).

Upon stimulation with dDAVP, AQP2 translocated to or near the cell surface ( Figure 4A, second row).

Furthermore, upon dDAVP stimulation, AQP2 - F204V failed to translocate to the cell surface ( Figure 4A, bottom row).

To investigate the mechanism of defective translocation of AQP2 - F204V, we turned to transfection of MDCK cells.

AQP2 - F204V, on the other hand, appeared in a punctate but perinuclear pattern ( Figure 4B, third column).

Along the z - axis, the perinuclear distribution of AQP2 - F204V was clearly seen, and this distribution is not altered by forskolin ( Figure 4B, bottom row, two right columns).

They are, however, severely defective in their ability to concentrate urine, leading to increased urine output and water intake, thus making them the first mouse model of NDI to survive to maturity.

Physiologically, heterozygous mice have no symptoms ( see Figure 1C), and they are indistinguishable from wild type on immunostaining of kidneys ( Figure 5A).

Similarly, changes in synaptic plasticity due to Ca2 + - permeable AMPARs [ 51, 52, 60], e. g., in piriform cortex, might alter odor memorization processes.

Concerning this intended switch in AMPAR properties, mice lacking all GluR - B, however, show a widespread impairment in behavior, including lethargy, motor coordination problems, and deficits in exploratory activity [ 51], which preclude detailed behavioral analyses.

Mice with forebrain - specific GluR - B depletion appeared almost completely normal throughout life with no developmental abnormalities, thus permitting a detailed, quantitative investigation of olfactory behavior.

By correlating GluR - B levels in olfaction - related brain regions with quantitative behavioral data, we investigated the dependence on GluR - B of olfactory discrimination and memory.

The specific GluR - B depletion in GluR - B Delta FB mice can be monitored by immunohistochemistry ( see below) and immunoblotting.

In quantitative immunoblot analyses, we found GluR - B levels reduced to 28 +/- 7%, 29 +/- 8%, and 52 +/- 9% ( +/- SEM; n = 10) in the hippocampus, cortical areas, and olfactory bulb, respectively, relative to GluR - B levels in GluR - B2lox littermate controls.

Exploratory activity in an open field task was slightly increased in GluR - B Delta FB mice ( 3, 480 cm +/- 180, n = 11), compared with wild - type littermates ( 2, 512 cm +/- 96, n = 12, p < 0. 01).

Hence, unlike the complete GluR - B knockouts, GluR - B Delta FB mice show only very minor changes in general activity and no sign of any major developmental disturbance, thus allowing detailed, quantitative behavioral investigations.

To probe olfactory memory in GluR - B Delta FB mice, six days after the end of the first training phase for odor discrimination ( amylacetate versus ethylbutyrate), the training trials for the third odor pair ( pelargonic versus valeric acid) were interleaved with unrewarded trials in which amylacetate or ethylbutyrate were again presented ( black bar in Figure 2C).

Whereas control mice reliably responded only to the previously rewarded odor ( memory of 86 +/- 8%, mean +/- SD, n = 9, Figure 2E), GluR - B Delta FB mice showed reduced olfactory memory ( 69 +/- 16%, n = 9, p < 0. 05, Mann - Whitney).	"mice	16	20	Organism"	"mice	150	154	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
While the improved odor discrimination and learning behavior showed only little variability, the significantly impaired memory performance observed in GluR - B Delta FB mice was highly variable among individual animals compared with control littermates ( Figure 2E).	"mice	169	173	Organism"	"animals	211	218	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 211, ""end_span"": 218, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We observed that onset and extent of Cre - recombinase expression in different forebrain regions varied among individual TgCre4 mice ( Figure 3A), which could also be directly visualized by immunohistochemistry with a Cre - antibody ( unpublished data).	"mice	128	132	Organism"	"antibody	224	232	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""antibody"", ""start_span"": 224, ""end_span"": 232, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Enhanced odor learning and discrimination, on the other hand, was independent of residual GluR - B levels in the olfactory bulb and other forebrain areas, indicating that moderate GluR - B reductions are sufficient to saturate enhanced odor learning and discrimination.	"GluR - B	90	98	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"GluR - B	180	188	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 180, ""end_span"": 188, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, although both are mediated by alterations in the AMPAR subunit GluR - B, due to the qualitatively different dose - response curves, the phenotypes regarding olfactory memory, and olfactory learning / discrimination must be mechanistically distinct.	"alterations	36	47	Sequence"	"GluR - B	69	77	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""alterations"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The olfactory memory phenotype could be due to depletion of GluR - B in olfactory cortex or hippocampus; enhanced learning and discrimination capabilities might rather be evoked by AMPARs lacking GluR - B in the olfactory bulb.	"GluR - B	60	68	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"GluR - B	196	204	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 196, ""end_span"": 204, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The transgenic expression level of GFPGluR - B was 9. 72% +/- 1. 25 ( n = 3) in the hippocampus, compared with endogenous GluR - B ( Figure 5C and 5D).	"transgenic	4	14	Sequence"	"GluR - B	38	46	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""transgenic"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Analysis of beta - galactosidase activity and GFPGluR - B expression in brain sections of GluR - BRescue mice revealed expression in hippocampus and piriform cortex, whereas cortex, amygdala, and striatum only rarely showed any positive cells ( Figure 5B).	"mice	105	109	Organism"	"cells	237	242	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 237, ""end_span"": 242, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Importantly, olfactory memory in GluR - BRescue mice was intermediate ( 75 +/- 15%, n = 8), below GluR - B2lox control levels, but better than in GluR - B Delta FB mice.	"mice	48	52	Organism"	"mice	164	168	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 168, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In summary, GluR - BRescue mice showed both enhanced memory performances compared with GluR - B Delta FB ( overall ANOVA: F ( 2, 41) = 13. 6, p < 10 - 4; memoryRescue = 75 +/- 15%, n = 8; memory Delta FB = 66 +/- 14%, n = 22; p < 0. 05; Figure 6A), but were still impaired relative to GluR - B2lox controls ( memory2lox = 88 +/- 8%, n = 14; p < 0. 005), consistent with a partial rescue of the memory deficit by circumscribed transgenic GFPGluR - B expression in hippocampus and piriform cortex.	"mice	27	31	Organism"	"transgenic	426	436	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""transgenic"", ""start_span"": 426, ""end_span"": 436, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
A 9. 7% increase in GluR - B in these brain regions, as achieved by GluR - BRescue animals ( Figure 5), is thus predicted to increase olfactory memory by approximately 9% throughout the heterogeneous population ( blue line in Figure 6B).	"GluR - B	20	28	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"animals	83	90	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
"A detailed analysis of the sampling pattern [ 3], and in particular the analysis of discrimination tasks that involved "" simple "" dissimilar monomolecular odor pairs and "" difficult "" binary mixtures, were necessary to fully capture the characteristics of the olfactory discrimination phenotype for forebrain - specific GluR - B - depleted mice."

Alternatively, transgenic protein levels might have been too low to alter discrimination and learning capabilities, although memory was clearly affected.

This notion will be further tested in mice with piriform cortex - specific GluR - B ablation.

In both mouse models Ca2 + influx through AMPA channels is increased, whereas the effect on the macroscopic AMPA conductance differs.	"mouse	8	13	Organism"	"Ca2 +	21	26	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Ca2 +"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
To assess olfactory memory of GluR - B Delta FB mice, after six days the mice were probed with unrewarded odor presentations that interleaved a simple discrimination task.	"mice	48	52	Organism"	"mice	73	77	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Finally, in other memory - related tasks, such as a hippocampus - dependent spatial reference memory task ( Figure S2), mice with GluR - B depletion were not impaired after task acquisition.	"mice	120	124	Organism"	"GluR - B	130	138	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
To dissect the discrimination, learning, and memory phenotypes, and ultimately identify potential cellular correlates, we made use of the variegated Cre expression of TgCre4 mice.	"cellular	98	106	Cell"	"mice	174	178	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""cellular"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 174, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Therefore, residual GluR - B levels were determined from each mouse that had been tested in the behavioral experiments, and levels were correlated with odor learning, discrimination, and olfactory memory.	"GluR - B	20	28	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mouse	62	67	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The significant direct correlation between residual GluR - B levels in hippocampus and cortical areas with olfactory memory suggested hippocampal and / or cortical neurons as putative mediators for odor memorization and / or storage.	"GluR - B	52	60	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"neurons	164	171	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 171, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
No measure of discrimination and learning, on the other hand, correlated with residual GluR - B levels; even the smallest reduction in GluR - B levels ( about 20% - 60%) was sufficient to establish and saturate enhanced odor discrimination capabilities.	"GluR - B	87	95	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"GluR - B	135	143	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
What could be the cellular basis of the long - term memory deficit brought about by lack of GluR - B - containing AMPARs?	"cellular	18	26	Cell"	"GluR - B	92	100	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""cellular"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Mechanistically, this is likely to be due to Ca2 + influx through GluR - B - less AMPA channels leading to non - hebbian forms of plasticity.	"Ca2 +	45	50	Chemical"	"GluR - B	66	74	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ca2 +"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, in other brain areas that are potentially important for the processing of olfactory information, such as piriform cortex or olfactory bulb, LTP measurements have not yet been performed; synapses of these pathways may be regulated differently than hippocampal CA3 / CA1 synapses.	"synapses	195	203	GO_ontology"	"synapses	278	286	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""synapses"", ""start_span"": 195, ""end_span"": 203, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""synapses"", ""start_span"": 278, ""end_span"": 286, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Additionally, by changing the Ca2 + permeability of AMPARs, Ca2 + signaling via AMPA and colocalized NMDA channels might be disturbed, thereby impairing memory formation.	"Ca2 +	30	35	Chemical"	"Ca2 +	60	65	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Ca2 +"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""Ca2 +"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Alternatively, long - term stabilization might involve GluR - B phosphorylation similar to cerebellar long - term depression [ 79] and thus be selectively impaired by GluR - B depletion.	"GluR - B	55	63	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"GluR - B	167	175	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 167, ""end_span"": 175, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Physiological experiments to assess these hypotheses will ideally make use of even more restricted genetic modifications with completely undisturbed input structures.	"genetic	99	106	Sequence"	"modifications	107	120	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""genetic"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""modifications"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
We made use of the epigenetic variability in GluR - B excision that could be correlated to the variability in memory but showed no correlation to variability in discrimination.	"GluR - B	45	53	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"excision	54	62	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""excision"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"

We could thus provide evidence for opposing roles of specific GluR - B manipulation and increased Ca2 + influx via AMPARs in olfactory discrimination / learning, and memory, potentially in the olfactory bulb and piriform cortex, respectively.

Analysis of the relationship between virtually - multiplexed transcript abundance data for each gene with age was assessed by Pearson ' s correlation, with gender by t - test, and with smoking history by ANOVA followed by Duncan ' s test.

For example, the non - BC individual and BC individual groups are not perfectly matched with respect to age, gender or smoking history ( Table 1) and each of these factors could contribute to the observed difference in correlation between groups.

Although the trials were halted because of adverse effects in a subset of volunteers [ 4, 5], further analysis of several patients found evidence that amyloid pathology, and to a lesser degree cognitive function, was improved in proportion to the patient ' s titer of A beta - specific antibody [ 6, 7].

Again, long - term dox treatment was begun at 6 mo of age, and mice were harvested after 3 mo of transgene suppression ( 6 mo untreated, n = 8; 9 mo untreated, n = 6; 6 mo + 3 mo treated, n = 8).

We also assessed neuritic and glial pathology surrounding the plaques to determine whether there were any changes in nearby tissue following long - term transgene suppression.

However, even during the light phase, the tTA / APP mice remained many - fold more active than normal controls.

In contrast, hyperactivity was completely abolished by rearing tTA / APP mice on dox.

We present a new mouse model for AD that was designed to test the consequences of inhibiting A beta production after the onset of amyloid pathology.

Amyloid burden worsens significantly with age, and by 9 mo, the hippocampus and cortex of untreated mice are largely filled with aggregated peptide.	"mice	100	104	Organism"	"peptide	140	147	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""peptide"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 147, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
We find that suppression of transgenic APP by more than 95% abruptly halts the progression of amyloid pathology.	"transgenic	28	38	Sequence"	"APP	39	42	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""transgenic"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""APP"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Importantly, this outcome occurs in animals already harboring considerable amyloid pathology, a situation similar to what might be expected in patients to be treated with secretase inhibitors.	"animals	36	43	Organism"	"inhibitors	181	191	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""inhibitors"", ""start_span"": 181, ""end_span"": 191, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Therapeutics used in humans will have considerably more time to act than is possible within the life span of rodent models.

Overall, however, we interpret our findings as evidence that AD therapies that significantly lower the production of A beta ( by either inhibiting secretase activity or inhibiting APP expression) may not quickly reverse preexisting pathology, but should effectively halt further deposition of amyloid.	"A beta	117	123	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"APP	180	183	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""A beta"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""APP"", ""start_span"": 180, ""end_span"": 183, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In our opinion, it seems unlikely that amyloid deposits in human brain would be inherently any less stable than those formed in mouse brain.	"human	59	64	Organism"	"mouse	128	133	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, the human brain may harbor clearance mechanisms not shared by mice that would allow more efficient removal of preexisting amyloid.	"human	13	18	Organism"	"mice	71	75	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In contrast, microglia surrounding amyloid plaques in human brain show a much higher state of activation with greater expression of complement receptor [ 40].	"microglia	13	22	Cell"	"human	54	59	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""microglia"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Even so, we considered the possibility that chronic dox treatment may have altered the activation state of microglia in our treated mice.	"microglia	107	116	Cell"	"mice	132	136	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""microglia"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, if dox does have anti - inflammatory activity, then, based on previous studies with other anti - inflammatories, we would have expected to find less amyloid in the dox - treated animals.	"anti - inflammatories	99	120	Chemical"	"animals	187	194	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""anti - inflammatories"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 187, ""end_span"": 194, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The persistence and stability of amyloid deposits in our system is unexpected given the speed with which A beta aggregates are cleared in other mouse models of therapeutic intervention.	"A beta	105	111	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mouse	144	149	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""A beta"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Anti - A beta antibodies injected directly into the brain have been shown to eliminate amyloid deposits in as little as 1 wk after treatment [ 49 - 51].	"A beta	7	13	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"antibodies	14	24	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""A beta"", ""start_span"": 7, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""antibodies"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
More recently, an alternative approach has shown that lentiviral transfer of neprilysin can also reduce the number of aggregates in the area of the injection site [ 54].	"lentiviral	54	64	Organism"	"neprilysin	77	87	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""lentiviral"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""neprilysin"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Careful study of the mechanism behind several of the antibody - mediated therapies has suggested that activated microglia play an important role in the removal of fibrillar plaques after immunization [ 50, 52, 55].	"antibody	53	61	GO_ontology"	"microglia	112	121	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""antibody"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""microglia"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The lack of clearance in both models of AD pathology comes as a stark contrast to the rapid removal of protein aggregates found in similar tet - off mouse models of Huntington [ 32] and prion disease [ 62].	"protein	103	110	Chemical"	"mouse	149	154	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 149, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In these cases, disrupting the input of new monomer to the system via dox - mediated transgene suppression led to relatively rapid clearance of protein aggregates.	"transgene	85	94	Sequence"	"protein	144	151	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""transgene"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
At present, because of unexpected noncognitive behavioral abnormalities, it is not clear whether the tet - off APP mice can be used to address the same question in the context of amyloid pathology.	"APP	111	114	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	115	119	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""APP"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Both lines of tTA / APP mice we studied here display extreme hyperactivity visible as cage circling and quantified by activity monitoring ( see Figure 7).	"APP	20	23	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	24	28	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""APP"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These data may indicate that the neuroactive culprit is not immediately present after transgenic APP synthesis is initiated, but requires additional time to develop.	"transgenic	86	96	Sequence"	"APP	97	100	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""transgenic"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""APP"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Alternatively, hyperactivity may be caused by neuronal alterations due to transgene expression during early postnatal development.	"neuronal	46	54	Cell"	"transgene	74	83	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""transgene"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
It is possible that a combination of therapies to limit A beta production, increase A beta degradation, and enhance phagocytosis of deposited amyloid may be required to reverse damage associated with AD.	"A beta	56	62	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"A beta	84	90	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""A beta"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""A beta"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Even at later stages in the disease, the presence of substantial microglial activation in human AD [ 40] suggests that simply slowing the formation of new amyloid deposits may allow ongoing phagocytosis to diminish preexisting lesions.	"microglial	65	75	Cell"	"human	90	95	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""microglial"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, the development of safe and effective secretase inhibitors will ultimately be required to determine whether the human brain has the capacity to repair amyloid - associated damage of AD once the progression of pathology is arrested.	"inhibitors	57	67	Chemical"	"human	121	126	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""inhibitors"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

( B) Quantitation of signal intensity from the Western blot in ( A) shows transgenic APP levels in line 18 are suppressed by more than 98% following 3 mo of dox treatment ( significant effect of group ANOVA F2, 8 = 1559. 7, p < 0. 001).

Amyloid histology in cortical ( first and third rows) and hippocampal ( second and fourth rows) sections from untreated tTA / APP mice shows a dramatic progression of pathology between 6 and 9 mo of age.

Suppression of transgenic APP expression arrests this progression, although without any sign of plaque clearance ( 6 mo + 3 mo dox).

New treatments are now being developed that will decrease the amount of A beta produced from APP.

The answer to this question may be important for deciding when A beta - lowering drugs should be started, and may also determine how effective they are in reversing the mental symptoms of AD.

This means that treatment with A beta - lowering drugs may be able to stop the disease from filling the brain with plaques.

These results indicate that treatments designed to lower the production of A beta may be an important part of future AD treatment, as this approach seems to prevents additional amyloid plaques from forming in the mouse brain.

We used these analyses to dissect the genetic regulation of the gonadal fat mass trait and to identify genes associated with the trait.

We performed permutation analyses over all gene expression traits, estimating false discovery rates ( FDRs) at different logarithm of odds ( LOD) score thresholds and assessing the overall rate of QTL detection.

It is clear from the ROC curves that the sex and sex - interaction terms add significantly to the detection of QTL for the gene expression traits.	"QTL	111	114	Sequence"	"gene	123	127	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""QTL"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""gene"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Using previously described conventions [ 20], QTL models without the final two interaction terms ( sex * add and sex * dom) have a suggestive threshold of 3. 0 ( p < 1 x 10 - 3) and a significant threshold of 4. 3 ( p < 5 x 10 - 5, genome - wide p < 0. 05).	"QTL	46	49	Sequence"	"genome	232	238	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""QTL"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""genome"", ""start_span"": 232, ""end_span"": 238, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
One suggestive ( Chromosome 1) and four significant ( Chromosomes 3, 5, 11, and 19) cQTLs for the gonadal fat mass trait were identified ( Figure 1A; Table 2).	"Chromosome	17	27	GO_ontology"	"Chromosomes	54	65	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Chromosome"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""Chromosomes"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Interestingly, the cQTL over Chromosome 11 did not improve, suggesting that the additional terms did not contribute to improved detection of this locus.	"Chromosome	29	39	GO_ontology"	"locus	146	151	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Chromosome"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""locus"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Analysis of all animals with and without sex as a covariate failed to demonstrate evidence of linkage on Chromosome 5.

However, using all 334 animals and adding the interaction terms to the QTL model significantly improved sensitivity, and a cQTL with a maximum LOD of 7. 56 ( p = 1. 7 x 10 - 6) was realized.	"animals	23	30	Organism"	"QTL	71	74	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""QTL"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Assuming purely additive effects of each genotype, these cQTLs account for approximately 42% of the variation in female F2 mice and 13% in males, consistent with the narrow sense heritability estimates for this trait and again demonstrating significant differences in the regulation and heritability of the gonadal fat trait between the sexes.

Individual transcript intensities were corrected for experimental variation and normalized and are reported as the mean log10 ratio ( mlratio) of an individual experiment relative to a pool composed of 150 mice randomly selected from the F2 population [ 21].

A heat map of the 2, 320 transcripts most differentially expressed ( p < 0. 05 in 10% or more of animals) relative to the pool is depicted in Figure 3.

The FDR at each threshold was determined by permuting the data 100 times and taking the mean number of QTLs detected over all of the permuted datasets at a given threshold, and dividing this count by the number of QTLs detected at the same threshold in the observed data.

Of these, 2, 118 eQTLs were located within 20 Mb ( roughly 10 cM) of the corresponding gene, likely representing eQTLs regulated by cis - acting variation within the gene itself.

Evidence for eQTL hotspots is clear on Chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 where significant fractions of the 6, 676 eQTLs colocalize within 2 cM regions on each chromosome.

Cis - eQTLs overlapping the confidence interval for the fat mass cQTL are candidate genes for the trait.

The colocalization of eQTLs for these correlated genes with the cQTL for the fat mass trait provides useful implications for the possible role of these genes.

As addressed below, given the complex multiorgan regulation of adipose tissue mass, it is unlikely that the genetic regulation of all five loci resides in the liver.

Genes that show significant correlation with gonadal fat mass and have trans - eQTLs coincident with the fat mass cQTL cannot be candidates directly responsible for the trait, as they are physically located elsewhere in the genome.

In order to see if there exist any hotspots for these eQTLs, we tested eQTLs with p < 0. 001 for enrichment along the genome in overlapping 2 - cM bins against the distribution of all liver eQTLs ( Figure 4A) using a Fisher exact test.	"genome	118	124	Sequence"	"overlapping	128	139	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""genome"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""overlapping"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
One locus on Chromosome 19 was significantly enriched for eQTLs of transcripts correlated with the gonadal fat mass trait.

The effect of the trans - eQTLs at the Chromosome 19 locus on gene expression is summarized in Figure 6.

In this study, we described a large, densely mapped, segregating F2 mouse population designed to study the genetic regulation of several traits associated with the so - called metabolic syndrome.

Several groups, including ours, have reported the advantage of combining traditional genetics with genome - wide gene expression analysis for the dissection of complex traits.

This study improved on past models by including over 300 animals ( three times the size of previous studies) of both sexes, allowing for the incorporation of sex - specific effects on underlying genetic regulation.

Furthermore, separate analyses would not allow for the detection of QTLs that have opposing, or sex - antagonistic, effects in females and males and would hinder the detection of QTLs specific to one sex.	"QTLs	68	72	Sequence"	"QTLs	179	183	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""QTLs"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""QTLs"", ""start_span"": 179, ""end_span"": 183, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Interestingly, significant heritability and genetic regulation was seen in this F2 population despite the hyperlipidemic, proinflammatory ApoE - / - background and the high - fat Western diet.

The predominantly female - driven effects of the five cQTLs likely reflect the significant effect of differential gonadal hormone secretions on the genetic regulation of this complex trait.

The widespread availability of genome - wide expression analysis has begun to address this by providing a snapshot of transcription in relevant organs and thus providing initial information for which genes can differentiate a given trait.	"genome	31	37	Sequence"	"genes	200	205	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""genome"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 200, ""end_span"": 205, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Those eQTLs that have cis - acting variations affecting their transcription are potential candidate genes for the trait.	"variations	35	45	Sequence"	"genes	100	105	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""variations"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
At a single trait, genome - wide significance level of 0. 05, we detected 6, 676 eQTLs representing 4, 998 genes, of which 2, 118 were cis - acting.	"genome	19	25	Sequence"	"genes	107	112	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""genome"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
A separate problem is that organ - specific gene expression differences may preclude one from detecting the relevant causative gene if the tissue arrayed is not the tissue where the control is exerted.	"gene	44	48	Sequence"	"gene	127	131	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""gene"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""gene"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
As indicated in Tables 4 and 5, several genes with detectable cis - eQTLs are also significantly correlated with the trait and are even further prioritized as candidate genes.	"genes	40	45	Sequence"	"genes	169	174	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
These eQTLs are significantly enriched at one locus ( Chromosome 19).	"locus	46	51	Sequence"	"Chromosome	54	64	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""locus"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Chromosome"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
This means that the genes may be causal but downstream of the gene responsible for the cQTLs, or they may be reacting to the increased gonadal fat mass and associated metabolic changes.	"genes	20	25	Sequence"	"gene	62	66	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""gene"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
These data also suggest that identifying such loci that show overrepresentation of highly correlated genes is a means to identify which of the trait cQTLs are more likely controlled by the tissue arrayed.

The effect of a QTL may be dependent on the state of a covariate; for instance, a QTL may have an effect specific to one sex, or may have opposite effects in the two sexes.

The full model ( Equation 6) allows us to model all heritable and sex - specific interactions in a single equation and maximally powers us to detect significant QTLs when the sex and sex - interaction terms are significant, given all 334 animals are included in the analysis.

Furthermore, using the full model obviates the need for modeling QTLs in one sex only, a procedure that could decrease our power by halving the sample size, rendering it impossible to detect interactions between QTLs and sex.

However, because the full model contains two more parameters than the model that treats sex as an additive covariate ( Equation 4), the LOD score threshold for significant linkage is higher ( using the convention of Lander and Kruglyak [ 20]), with QTL - specific significance levels of 2 x 10 - 3 and 5 x 10 - 5 equivalent to LOD scores of 4. 0 ( suggestive linkage) and 5. 4 ( significant linkage, equivalent to genome - wide p < 0. 05), respectively.

When the 5xGAL4 - pGL3 reporter plasmid was co - transfected, DBD - mrs repressed luciferase activity by about 90% in a dose - dependent manner ( Fig. 7B).

This result suggested to us the possibility that DBD - mrs exerts transcriptional repressive activity via self - association through its SAM domain.

While the ability of mr - s self - association partially correlates with transcriptional repressive activity, these mutants do not compromise the ability to repress transcription critically.

As a consequence, DBD - SAM ( amino acids 384 to 462) did not have a repressive effect on the 5xGAL4 - pGL3 reporter plasmid.

On the other hand, luciferase activity was repressed by 55% when DBD - tail ( amino acids 459 to 542) was co - transfected with this reporter plasmid ( Fig. 7D).

However, luciferase activity was repressed by about 30% in Y79 cells, while it was repressed by 90% in HEK293T cells.

In situ hybridization and RT - PCR showed significant reduction of mr - s signal in the Crx KO retina and pineal gland.

This strongly suggests that mr - s self - associates through its SAM domain.

Our results, however, showed that the self - association of mr - s through its SAM domain is not essential for the transcriptional repressive activity.

However, the repressive effect was more significant when DBD - tail, which does not contain SAM domain, was co - introduced with the 5xGAL4 - pGL3 reporter plasmid.	"domain	96	102	Sequence"	"plasmid	156	163	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""domain"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""plasmid"", ""start_span"": 156, ""end_span"": 163, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"

Therefore, we speculate that the mechanism of repression of mr - s may be HDAC - independent and more similar to that of PRC1 complex.

Furthermore, anaemia and developmental delay present in patients with TTD [ 24] and in XpdTTD / TTD mice [ 15] were both partially rescued in compound heterozygous XpdTTD / + XPCS mice ( Figure 2D and 2E).

Because patients with TTD, XPCS, and CS ( but not XP) and the corresponding mouse models share similar accelerated progeroid symptoms [ 12, 13, 15, 23], we next addressed ageing - related parameters in compound heterozygous mice ( Figure 3).

Thus, the improved UV survival observed in compound heterozygote cells ( Figure 4A) and likely the rescue of TTD progeroid symptoms ( Figure 3) were not due to normalisation of TFIIH levels, suggesting a qualitative rather than a quantitative effect on these phenotypes in vivo.	"cells	65	70	Cell"	"TFIIH	177	182	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""TFIIH"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 182, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
In contrast, the level of XPCS mRNA expression did affect the ability of the encoded protein ( XPDG602D) to restore the TTD hair phenotype to normal.

TTD - specific cutaneous and anaemic features, on the other hand, are thought to result from a specific kind of transcriptional insufficiency caused by depletion of unstable TFIIH during the terminal differentiation of skin, hair - shaft, and blood cells [ 16, 24].

In contrast to two hemizygous XPDXPCS patients carrying the XPDG47R - or XPDR666W - encoding alleles who died of the disease before 2 y of age, two compound heterozygous XPDXPCS patients carrying the same XPDG47R - or XPDR666W - encoding alleles in addition to the presumed null XPDL461V + del716 - 730 both had considerably milder disease symptoms and survived more than ten times longer ( A.

Similar to the XpdTTD / + XPCS and XpdTTD / + XP mice described here, both patients with XPTTD described so far had intermediate hair cysteine values.

The ~ 48% UV - UDS value presented in this study for XpdTTD / TTD cells differs from our previously published data of 25% UV - UDS [ 21], possibly because of the high variability intrinsic to the assay or routine variations in the cell culture conditions.

Identification of novel modulators and factors of these pathways can be identified by associating the phenotype with a location ( s) on a specific chromosome, a quantitative trait locus ( QTL).

The bleeding times ( Figure 4A) for the B6 and the A / J mice were not different, but 6six of the strains, B6 - Chr5, 6, 8, 14, 15, and YA / J, had lower ( P < 0. 002) bleeding times ( 49 - 79 seconds) compared to the value for the B6 mice ( 121 sec).

The rebleeding values for CSS - 5F1 and CSS - 17F1 mice were similar to the B6 rather than the A / J mice, suggesting the A / J trait is recessive.

The CSS - 5 and CSS - 17 had occlusion times similar to the B6 mice, but the doubly heterosomic CSS - 5 x CSS - 17 progeny had occlusion times higher than either the B6 mice or the heterosomic CSS - 5F1 and CSS - 17F1 or the A / J strains.

PAI - 1 antigen and activity were decreased in both CSS - 5 and CSS - 17 and the heterosomic mice, CSS - 5F1 and CSS - 17F1, but not in the CSS - 11 strain.

The pattern of blood flow cessation for the two inbred strains was different than for the Lepob mice [ 26] with impaired platelet function, and coagulation time was similar in the two strains.

Overall, the marked increase in rebleeding times observed in certain mouse strains suggests genetic factors other than coagulation may play a role in the stability of a thrombus.

In Chaf1a - / - E4 embryos, which are arrested between the eight - and 16 - cell stage, DAPI - dense foci were barely detectable ( Figure 1D).

Given the early developmental arrest observed in Chaf1a - / - embryos, such cells could not be derived directly from null embryos, and we thus used an RNAi strategy ( Figure 2A).	"Chaf1a	49	55	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cells	76	81	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Chaf1a"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
p150CAF - 1 knockdown in ES cells was quantified by Western blot analysis and IF.

These observations reveal a specific function for CAF - 1 in the early embryo and ES cells.

These data show that nuclear architecture is not globally altered following CAF - 1 loss - of - function.

Pericentric domains from different chromosomes form clusters, which are revealed by FISH as large spots that coincide with DAPI - dense foci in the interphase nucleus ( Figure 4A).	"Pericentric domains from different chromosomes	0	46	GO_ontology"	"nucleus	159	166	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Pericentric domains from different chromosomes"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""nucleus"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 166, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
At the periphery of each pericentric domain, centric regions form individual entities ( Figure 4A).	"pericentric domain	25	43	GO_ontology"	"regions	53	60	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""pericentric domain"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""regions"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Individual pericentric domains from single chromosomes are now found either isolated or aggregated in a pattern less dense than the regular clusters observed in control cells ( Figure 4B).	"pericentric domains from single chromosomes	11	54	GO_ontology"	"cells	169	174	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""pericentric domains from single chromosomes"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Such aggregates, which are often found at the nuclear periphery, are also revealed by DAPI staining as a typical signature of p150CAF - 1 loss - of - function.	"nuclear	46	53	GO_ontology"	"p150CAF - 1	126	137	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In conclusion, these results show that p150CAF - 1 is required for the proper condensation and clustering of pericentric heterochromatin domains.	"p150CAF - 1	39	50	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"pericentric heterochromatin domains	109	144	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""pericentric heterochromatin domains"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Therefore, the loss of clustering and decondensation of pericentric heterochromatin are unlikely to be the consequence of severe defects in nucleosomal organization.

Moreover, no significant difference in immunoprecipitation efficiency was detected at intracisternal A particle ( IAP) elements ( Figure 7B), which are noncentromeric repeated DNA elements also enriched in H4K20me3 [ 31].

The H3K9me3 mark [ 32] was also significantly reduced in p150CAF - 1 - depleted cells, though to a lesser extent than H4K20me3 ( Figure 7A and 7B).	"p150CAF - 1	57	68	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cells	80	85	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In wild - type cells, most of H4K20me3 and H3K9me3 signals are present at the level of DAPI - dense domains when visualized by IF [ 29] ( Figures 7C and 7D).

Given the major defects observed in heterochromatin organization, it is tempting to speculate that these defects cause the developmental arrest in the embryos and death in ES cells.	"heterochromatin	36	51	GO_ontology"	"cells	175	180	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""heterochromatin"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 180, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Alternatively, 3 - D organization of heterochromatin and epigenetic marking might represent two independent functions of CAF - 1.	"heterochromatin	37	52	GO_ontology"	"CAF - 1	121	128	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""heterochromatin"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Hence, remodeling of heterochromatin 3 - D organization parallels nuclear reprogramming toward an early embryonic status in cloned embryos.

It has long been known that loss of the retinoblastoma protein ( Rb) perturbs neural differentiation, but the underlying mechanism has never been solved.

However, in what is to our knowledge the first work to dissect E2f isoform function in vivo we show that Rb promotes SAC differentiation through E2f3a.

However, Rb loss could also perturb differentiation through the indirect effects of abnormal division or death, and / or through direct regulation of differentiation genes by E2fs.

In other cell types where Rb may promote differentiation directly, such as muscle and bone, it seems to do so through E2f - independent means by potentiating tissue - specific transcription factors ( Figure 1B) [ 30 - 33].

However, differentiation defects in any Rb KO neuron could be an indirect effect of ectopic division and / or apoptosis ( Figure 1B).

Thus, it is critical to study differentiation of Rb KO cells in the absence of ectopic proliferation and death.

As reported before [ 2, 3], Rb KO retinas exhibited both spatial and temporal ectopic DNA synthesis ( Figures 1C and S1A).

These data contrast with previous findings in the lens and CNS of Rb KO embryos, where deletion of any activating E2f suppresses ectopic division to some extent [ 6 - 9].

Thus, among the cell cycle regulators we examined, most showed bivalent distribution, and E2f3b was unusual in its solely nuclear compartmentalization.

E2f1 may also regulate differentiation targets, but whether this contributes to defects in retinal cell maturation is impossible to separate from potentially indirect consequences of deregulated division and death.

Instead, we observed E2f1 - independent defects in the synthesis and transport of a large cohort of SAC proteins.

These data expand insight into the development of these important interneurons, but more critically, provide to our knowledge the first unambiguous evidence that Rb regulates neurogenesis beyond terminal mitosis.

The idea that Rb promotes muscle differentiation by potentiating Myod1 activity was contested [ 61], and other mechanisms proposed [ 62, 63], but not involving E2f repression.

Strikingly, however, we discovered that Rb promotes SAC differentiation through E2f3 ( Figure 8).	"Rb	40	42	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"E2f3	80	84	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""E2f3"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

Rb performs this function by inhibiting E2f1.	"Rb	0	2	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"E2f1	40	44	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 2, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""E2f1"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
There is no direct evidence that Rb is required for terminal differentiation of other cell types.

E2f3b was the primary candidate, since Rb and E2f3b collaborate to repress targets in quiescent cells in vitro [ 19].

Formally, we cannot exclude the possibility that deleting E2f3b might also rescue SAC differentiation, but definitive proof will require analysis of E2f3b null mice.

The unique 121 - and six - residue N - termini of E2f3a and E2f3b, respectively, likely mediate this difference.

In the retina, differentiating transition cells are born in the absence of Rb, migrate to the correct layer, and express appropriate markers ( [ 2] and this work).

E2f3a could disrupt SAC differentiation through its well known role as a transcriptional activator, or, in view of the discovery that it is partially cytoplasmic, E2f3a may affect processes other than gene regulation.

One study reported that Rb mutants that do not bind E2f still induce differentiation [ 30].

However, the binding assays were performed in solution, and we have found that several of these mutants do bind E2f, albeit weakly, on chromatin ( T. Yu and R. B., unpublished data).

It is possible that Rb - mediated potentiation of tissue - specific transcription factors may, at least in some cases, be a redundant activity, and that the only critical Rb function is to inhibit E2f.
