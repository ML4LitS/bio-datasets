Mechanisms that establish the general body plan make use of a relatively small number of signaling pathways shared among all animals ( reviewed in Pires - daSilva and Sommer 2003), but the extent to which these pathways control finer differences between body regions is not clear.

In natural environments, color variation is a nearly universal mechanism for recognition, camouflage, or both; consequently, a large number of pigment patterns have been characterized from an evolutionary and ecological perspective ( Boughman 2001; Jiggins et al. 2001).	"pigment	143	150	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""pigment"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"

Within hair follicles, paracrine signals control the type of pigment made in specific regions of the body or at specific times during the hair cycle ( reviewed in Furumura et al. 1996; Barsh et al. 2000).

One of the most obvious aspects of regional color variation in vertebrates is a dark dorsal surface juxtaposed to a light ventral surface, apparent in the color of skin, scales, feathers, or hair, in which the boundary between dorsal and ventral compartments is often sharp and lies in register with the limbs.

In particular, ventral hair of at / at animals can vary from cream - colored to reddish - yellow depending on age, strain background, and position along the dorsoventral axis.	"animals	39	46	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Within the region of transition from dorsum to ventrum ( Figure 1B), flank hairs from at / at mice become progressively shorter and exhibit increasing amounts of pheomelanin deposition progressing from the tip to the base of the hair.

However, differences in skin thickness disappear by 3 - 4 wk of age ( Forsthoefel et al. 1966), and, overall, the proportion of different hair types is also similar in dorsa and ventra of adult mice.

External craniofacial malformations are the most obvious characteristic of deH / deH animals, including widely spaced eyes, small palpebral fissures, a broad nasal area, and a shortened skull held in an elevated position, which presumably causes or contributes to the abnormal position of the ears.

By E13. 5, the developing dermis has become separated from the loose mesenchyme by a subcutaneous muscle layer; Tbx15 is expressed in all of these layers as well as the underlying abdominal muscles.

En1 is transiently expressed in the developing flank; at E11. 5, transverse abdominal sections reveal domains in the neural tube, somite - derived mesenchyme, and the ventral body wall ( Figure 8C).

An adjacent section hybridized with Tbx15 reveals a complementary pattern in the flank, which provides additional evidence for developmental mechanisms that establish a pigmentation boundary entirely within lateral plate mesoderm and independent of lineage restrictions imposed by the lateral somitic frontier.

Loss of Tbx15 also affects regional distribution of hair color in the limbs, with areas that would normally produce black hair giving rise to yellow hair instead.	"Tbx15	8	13	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Tbx15"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, the number and apparent position of the mammary glands are normal in deH / deH animals, indicating the existence of additional mechanisms that control dorsoventral patterning in the trunk as well as in the limbs.

In fact, the same mechanism that determines dorsoventral position of the limbs and the apical ectodermal ridge may also act on expression of Tbx15 in the trunk, since ectopic limbs induced in the interlimb region by application of FGF beads develop along a single line that is coincident with normal limb buds ( and the future pigmentation boundary) ( Cohn et al. 1995; Crossley et al. 1996; Vogel et al. 1996; Altabef et al. 1997, 2000).

The initial reports of patients with ESCS attributed the unusual ERG to an abnormally functioning rod photoreceptor system with persistent activity under light adaptation [ 6 - 8].	"rod photoreceptor	98	115	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rod photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Nevertheless, the overall density of cones was only modestly increased in this patient ( approximately 2 - fold), suggesting that there might be additional factors that contribute to the very large, light - adapted ERG seen in this disease.	"cones	37	42	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cones"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In addition to the ERG findings, patients with ESCS have dysmorphic retinas with rosette formation in the outer nuclear layer ( ONL) where photoreceptor cell bodies reside, and a slow retinal degeneration that can ultimately lead to complete blindness [ 12 - 14].	"photoreceptor cell	139	157	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptor cell"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

In situ hybridization was performed on an additional 45 up - regulated genes, confirming that 21 of them were derepressed.	"genes	71	76	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
All of these genes show marked derepression in the rd7 retina.	"genes	13	18	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
This localization manifests in a section in situ hybridization as a dark band of staining just beyond the outer edge of the ONL immediately underlying the outer segment layer.

One possible interpretation of this unusual expression pattern is that it represents an early reaction of M u ller glia to injury in this mutant.	"mutant	138	144	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"

Since the change in rhodopsin levels identified by Peng et al. were relatively small ( an approximately 15% reduction), it is not surprising that such a difference was not detected by in situ hybridization.

Human patients with ESCS display three types of abnormality attributable to the retina: ( 1) an atypical ERG waveform that is preferentially sensitive to short - wavelength light, ( 2) slowly progressive retinal degeneration, and ( 3) abnormal retinal lamination with rosette formation [ 1, 12, 13].	"Human	0	5	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Human"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

This neonatal lethality is likely due to the accumulation of BCAA to neurotoxic levels, ketoacidosis, brain edema, dehydration, and malnutrition as observed in the MSUD calf [ 17] and in classic MSUD patients [ 1].

Early Embryonic Lethality in Atrxnull Male Mice	"Mice	43	47	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Mice"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Embryos were dissected at 7. 5, 8. 5, and 9. 5 dpc and genotyped by PCR analysis of DNA extracted from yolk sac or total embryo ( Figure 4B and Protocol S1).	"DNA	84	87	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""DNA"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Only background staining was seen in the corresponding Atrxnull embryonic tissues ( Figure 5B - 5D), while expression in the surrounding decidual tissue ( of maternal origin) was normal and served as an antibody staining control ( unpublished data).	"antibody	203	211	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""antibody"", ""start_span"": 203, ""end_span"": 211, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Morphologically, 7. 5 dpc Atrxnull embryos were dramatically reduced in size and appeared developmentally retarded relative to stage - matched wild - type embryos ( Figure 5A and 5B).	"wild - type	143	154	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""wild - type"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"

Since this small apoptotic response is unlikely to account fully for the dramatic size deficit observed in Atrxnull embryos, a possible proliferation defect was also investigated by immunohistochemical staining of 7. 5 dpc embryo sections for the mitosis marker phosphorylated ( Ser10) histone H3 [ 13].	"histone	286	293	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""histone"", ""start_span"": 286, ""end_span"": 293, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
When embryos were removed from deciduas, the surrounding trophectoderm layer appeared dramatically reduced in Atrxnull embryos relative to wild - type littermates, and the underlying ectoplacental cone appeared reduced and abnormally shaped ( Figure 7A).	"wild - type	139	150	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""wild - type"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Taken together, these data suggest that loss of Atrx results in a defect in formation of the secondary trophoblast that is apparent from 7. 5 dpc.	"Atrx	48	52	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Atrx"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Surviving adult carrier female mice were not phenotypically normal and exhibited mild behavioural abnormalities, although some could reproduce.	"mice	31	35	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, the absence of Atrx in the extraembryonic compartment is lethal in Atrxnull / Y males.	"Atrx	24	28	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Atrx"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This suggested the possibility of an escape from imprinted inactivation of the paternally derived AtrxWT allele in the extraembryonic compartment of a proportion of carrier female embryos.

Remarkably, clear Atrx expression could also be detected in the extraembryonic tissues of carrier females, as shown in the extraembryonic - derived chorionic ectoderm ( Figure 8C).

We show that Atrxnull male mice are not viable and embryos die by around 9. 5 dpc.	"mice	27	31	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Although the embryonic compartment of the conceptus appears initially normal, by 7. 5 dpc Atrxnull embryos display abnormalities in development of the trophoblast, including a depletion in the population of TGCs surrounding the conceptus and a reduction in the size of the ectoplacental cone, which contains the diploid giant cell precursors [ 22].

Growth of pelage hair was generally delayed in the mutants.	"mutants	51	58	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""mutants"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
At around P8, the KA mutants were hairless and had wrinkled skin while their phenotypically normal littermates had a smooth thin coat of hair ( Figure 2B).	"mutants	21	28	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""mutants"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
At this age, two lower incisors start to erupt in normal littermates and these were absent in the KA mutants ( Figure 2C and 2D).	"mutants	101	108	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""mutants"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Animals also tended to be smaller and around P10 - P12 displayed abnormally short and misshapen vibrissae and short, shaggy pelage hairs ( Figure 2C and 2D).	"Animals	0	7	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Animals"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These regions looked scaly, and these animals hardly kept their eyes open.	"animals	38	45	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In contrast to the normal littermates that consistently increased their body weight with age, surviving KA mutants started to lose weight from P10 onwards; by P16 - P17 they were all lethargic, and none of them survived to weaning ( Figure 2E and 2F).	"mutants	107	114	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""mutants"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Interestingly, changes in body weights and timing of hair growth varied considerably among mutant pups even if they were from the same litter, whereas those of phenotypically normal littermates tended to be similar.	"mutant	91	97	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
It is possible that the genetic background has a role to play in this variability.	"genetic	24	31	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""genetic"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Gross examination of internal organs also showed that the mutants ' thymi were consistently inconspicuous and were very small for their age, whereas those of their littermates were very prominent in size ( Figure 2G).	"mutants	58	65	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""mutants"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
To understand the basis for delayed and abnormal hair development in the KA mutants, we conducted a histological and immunohistochemical examination ( Figure 4).	"mutants	76	83	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""mutants"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
The inner layers of the hair follicle include three concentric layers of inner root sheath and three concentric layers of hair - producing cells.	"cells	139	144	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

During the anagen phase of the hair cycle ( until P15), hair follicles of phenotypically normal mice grew deeply into the subcutaneous fat and were uniformly spaced and aligned in parallel arrays at a specific angle relative to the skin surface ( Figure 4A).	"mice	96	100	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Serial sectioning indicated that some of the hair follicles in the P12 mutant skin were not properly formed or shorter than normal.	"mutant	71	77	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
We examined the patterns of expression of beta - catenin in the affected tissues.	"beta - catenin	42	56	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""beta - catenin"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Similarly, the pattern of expression of K6, which is normally only expressed in the suprabasal or inner layer of the ORS of the hair follicle but not in the epidermis ( Figure 4E), did not change.	"K6	40	42	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""K6"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Due to the abnormal and disorganized structure of hair follicles themselves, K6 localization highlighted the histological abnormality ( Figure 4J).	"K6	77	79	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""K6"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In normal skin, proliferating cells were detected in either the basal layer of epidermis or in germinative hair follicle bulbs at the base ( Figure 4B).	"cells	30	35	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Each budding tip was becoming like a hair follicle bulb containing proliferating cells.	"cells	81	86	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Hence, despite the abnormal histology in the mutant skin, proliferation seems to be confined to bulb - like structures as in the normal skin ( Figure 4G and 4G ').	"mutant	45	51	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
The exact locations of hair follicle bulbs were not as easy to define for some mutant follicles due to their disorganized structures.	"mutant	79	85	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"

Aberrant hair placodes were also evident throughout the skin surface of limbs in E15. 5 mutants ( Figure 5F), whereas those of the control embryos had not yet formed ( Figure 5E).	"mutants	88	95	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""mutants"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Despite the grossly toothless phenotype of KA mutants, histological analysis of their oral cavities revealed the formation of multiple tooth buds at each location.	"mutants	46	53	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""mutants"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"

In normal mice, the thymus retains its size until the young adult age and regresses thereafter by atrophy.	"mice	10	14	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In the normal young mice we examined ( P3 - P17), it is evident that thymocytes were mitotically active in the cortex as determined by BrdU immunostaining ( Figure 6B).	"mice	20	24	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The histological abnormalities of thymus were evident as early as P3 in KA mutants ( Figure 6E and 6H).	"mutants	75	82	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""mutants"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Interestingly, variations in the phenotypic severity of the mutant pups at P3 were prominently reflected in the extent of histological abnormalities of thymus.	"mutant	60	66	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
The milder P3 mutant thymus was already much smaller in size compared to those of normal littermates ( data not shown) but two epithelial compartments of thymus were histologically still distinguishable, with colonization of thymocytes evident in the cortex.

Proliferative activities were no longer observed in thymocytes as prominently as in the normal thymus, but the epithelial cells seemed to be forming concentric structures ( Figure 6I).

Current models of hair follicle development suggest that the establishment of a regular array of placodes in the surface epithelium in response to the first dermal message is achieved through the competing activities of molecules that promote or repress placode fate [ 24].

We did not find any obvious histopathological abnormalities in the internal organs of KA mice that could contribute to the lethality.	"mice	89	93	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Dermal fat was reduced in the mutant skin, possibly as a consequence of poor nutrition caused by the absence of teeth.	"mutant	30	36	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Since the weight loss in KA mutants started from P8 - P10 while pups were still nursed by their mothers, starvation due to lack of teeth cannot be the sole cause of death, but is likely to be a contributing factor.

Hence, neither loss nor excess of tooth bud formation allows proper development of teeth for mice to have a healthy diet and normal life.	"mice	93	97	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
