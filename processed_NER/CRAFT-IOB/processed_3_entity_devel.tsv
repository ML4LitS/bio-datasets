Among vertebrates, differences in the shape or number of skeletal elements, altered morphology of epidermal appendages, and variation in pigment distribution combine to produce the majority of what distinguishes one animal from another.

In the laboratory, color variation has been the subject of vertebrate genetics for more than a century ( Searle 1968; Silvers 1979), and many pigmentary components have been identified whose actions are understood in a cellular or organ - based context ( reviewed in Bennett and Lamoreux 2003).	"vertebrate	59	69	Organism"	"pigmentary	142	152	Chemical"	"cellular	219	227	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""vertebrate"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""pigmentary"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""cellular"", ""start_span"": 219, ""end_span"": 227, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
However, for all of these mechanisms -- white spotting, pigment - type switching, and melanosome biogenesis -- more is known about the identity of the molecular components than their spatial and temporal control.	"pigment	56	63	Chemical"	"melanosome	86	96	GO_ontology"	"molecular	151	160	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""pigment"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""melanosome"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""molecular"", ""start_span"": 151, ""end_span"": 160, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Ventral - specific Agouti isoforms are also expressed in developing skin from embryonic day 10. 5 ( E10. 5) and beyond and may play a role in pigment cell differentiation ( Millar et al. 1995).	"Agouti	19	25	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"isoforms	26	34	Sequence"	"pigment cell	142	154	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Agouti"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""isoforms"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""pigment cell"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Thus, regulatory elements for ventral - specific Agouti isoforms are responsive to dorsoventral positional cues established in the embryo and whose effects persist after birth.	"regulatory elements	6	25	Sequence"	"Agouti	49	55	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"isoforms	56	64	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""regulatory elements"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Agouti"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""isoforms"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Furthermore, dorsoventral differences in pigmentation can represent differences in the number and / or differentiated state of pigment cells, as well as the type of pigment synthesized in response to expression of Agouti.	"pigment cells	127	140	Cell"	"pigment	165	172	Chemical"	"Agouti	214	220	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""pigment cells"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""pigment"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 172, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""Agouti"", ""start_span"": 214, ""end_span"": 220, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
To evaluate the relationship among these components, we compared their features among mice of different Agouti genotypes.	"mice	86	90	Organism"	"Agouti	104	110	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"genotypes	111	120	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Agouti"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""genotypes"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Furthermore, measurements of relative hair length for animals of different age, size, and Agouti genotype also are very similar when normalized to body circumference ( Figure 1C).

Using DOPA staining as an indicator of tyrosinase activity, we observed a gradual dorsoventral transition in isolated dermis preparations from P4. 5 ae / ae mice ( Figure 1G).

An abnormal dorsoventral pigment pattern is readily apparent in at / at; deH / deH mice, but comparison to nonmutant animals is more accurately described in terms of ventral, lateral, and dorsal regions ( Figures 1G and 2A).	"pigment	25	32	Chemical"	"mice	83	87	Organism"	"animals	117	124	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""pigment"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The lateral region contains yellow hairs of progressively increasing length; in at / at mice, the lateral region appears as a thin yellow stripe along the flank, but in at / at; deH / deH mice, the lateral region is considerably expanded with a diffuse boundary along the dorsal flank, and a dorsal eumelanic region whose size is correspondingly reduced ( Figure 2A and 2B).	"mice	88	92	Organism"	"mice	188	192	Organism"	"eumelanic	299	308	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 188, ""end_span"": 192, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""eumelanic"", ""start_span"": 299, ""end_span"": 308, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
At this stage, melanoblast migration from the neural crest is mostly complete, but there is a dorsoventral gradient in melanocyte differentiation and pigment synthesis.

By Northern blot analysis, we identified a fusion transcript produced from the deH chromosome ( data not shown).	"fusion	43	49	Sequence"	"transcript	50	60	Sequence"	"chromosome	83	93	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""fusion"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""transcript"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""chromosome"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
In P4. 5 skin, expression of Agouti is also extended dorsally in deH / deH animals and is most apparent in the midflank region within the upper dermis and dermal papillae cells ( Figure 6B).	"Agouti	29	35	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"animals	75	82	Organism"	"dermal papillae cells	155	176	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Agouti"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""dermal papillae cells"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
As predicted from the experiments using tissue sections ( see Figures 5 and 6), dorsal pieces expressed Tbx15 but not Agouti, while flank pieces expressed both genes ( see Figure 7).	"Tbx15	104	109	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Agouti	118	124	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"genes	160	165	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Tbx15"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Agouti"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 160, ""end_span"": 165, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Thus, dorsoventral identity for adult pigmentation is established by the time when patterned expression becomes apparent for Tbx15 and Agouti ( E11. 5 - E12. 5); furthermore, positional identity is maintained throughout later stages of skin development, even though expression of Tbx15 broadens to include ventral as well as dorsal skin.	"Tbx15	125	130	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Agouti	135	141	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Tbx15	280	285	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Tbx15"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Agouti"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Tbx15"", ""start_span"": 280, ""end_span"": 285, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
To examine directly the relationship between the pigmentation boundary and dermis derived from lateral plate mesoderm, we made use of a Cre transgene driven by the Hoxb6 promoter that was developed by Kuehn and colleagues ( Lowe et al. 2000).	"transgene	140	149	Sequence"	"Hoxb6	164	169	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"promoter	170	178	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""transgene"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Hoxb6"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 169, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""promoter"", ""start_span"": 170, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
( 2000), midgestation embryos carrying both the Hoxb6 - Cre transgene and the R26R lacZ reporter gene ( Soriano 1999) exhibit X - Gal staining in lateral plate mesoderm but not somite - derived mesoderm of the trunk.

The visual boundary between dorsal and ventral skin in at / at mice is reminiscent of other systems in which adjacent compartments enforce a binary choice between alternative patterns of gene expression and cell fate ( reviewed in Dahmann and Basler 1999).	"mice	63	67	Organism"	"gene	187	191	Sequence"	"cell	207	211	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""gene"", ""start_span"": 187, ""end_span"": 191, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 207, ""end_span"": 211, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
However, Agouti mRNA in both embryonic and postnatal skin is distributed along a gradient whose dorsal boundary is indistinct and overlaps with two additional gradients recognized by their effects on hair length and histochemical staining for melanocytes.

Expression of Tbx18 and Tbx22 has not been reported in embryonic flank mesenchyme, which suggests that Tbx15 is the only family member involved in establishing the dorsoventral identity of the trunk.	"Tbx18	14	19	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Tbx22	24	29	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Tbx15	103	108	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Tbx18"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Tbx22"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Tbx15"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In an initial description of the expression and map location of mouse Tbx15, Agulnik et al.	"map	48	51	Sequence"	"location	52	60	Sequence"	"mouse Tbx15	64	75	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""map"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""location"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""mouse Tbx15"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
( 1998) suggested human Tbx15 that lies on Chromosome 1p11. 1 as a candidate for acromegaloid facial appearance ( AFA) syndrome, for which there is a weak positive LOD score to Chromosome 1p ( Hughes et al. 1985).	"human Tbx15	18	29	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Chromosome	43	53	GO_ontology"	"Chromosome	177	187	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""human Tbx15"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Chromosome"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""Chromosome"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 187, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
The deH phenotype exhibits little overlap with these features; instead, we suggest a more likely candidate for mutations of human TBX15 would be frontofacionasal syndrome, an unmapped autosomal recessive condition characterized by brachycephaly, blepharophimosis, and midface hypoplasia ( Reardon et al. 1994).

Because an expanded domain of embryonic Agouti expression in deH / deH animals is detectable by E14. 5, the effects of Tbx15 on dorsoventral patterning must occur prior to this time.	"Agouti	40	46	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"animals	71	78	Organism"	"Tbx15	119	124	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Agouti"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Tbx15"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Among other T - box genes whose developmental actions are at least partially understood, two general themes have emerged, one focused on the ability to specify alternative fates for an undifferentiated group of precursor cells and another focused on the ability to support proliferative expansion of a cell population whose fate is already determined ( reviewed in Tada and Smith 2001).	"genes	20	25	Sequence"	"cells	221	226	Cell"	"cell	302	306	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 221, ""end_span"": 226, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 302, ""end_span"": 306, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
One potential target is Alx4, which, like Agouti, is expressed in ventral embryonic mesenchyme, and, when mutated, affects hair - follicle as well as limb and craniofacial development ( Qu et al. 1997, 1998; Wu et al. 2000; Wuyts et al. 2000; Mavrogiannis et al. 2001).

However, expression of ventral markers such as Alx4, as well as Alx3 and Msx2, appears to be unaffected at E11. 5 in deH / deH embryos ( data not shown).

Furthermore, losses of function for En1 or Wnt7a, which cause a partial transformation of the distal limb from dorsum to ventrum ( Loomis et al. 1996) or ventrum to dorsum ( Parr and McMahon 1995), respectively, have no effect on regional patterns of Agouti expression or distribution of hair - color regions ( Y. Chen, unpublished data).

At the cellular level, dopamine signaling is mediated through D1 - like or D2 - like receptors.

In support of this view are several studies demonstrating that the disruption of dopamine signaling via acute blockade of dopamine receptors with dopamine receptor antagonists [ 3 - 9] or 6 - OHDA lesions [ 1, 10, 11] do not disrupt phase 1, the palatability or primary reinforcing characteristics of a natural reinforcer ( e. g. palatability) but disrupt phase 2, the formation of incentive salience.

Besides their lack of receptor subtype specificity, an acute exposure to commercially available D2 receptor antagonists fails to completely block signaling mediated solely by D2Rs.

Here we report that dopamine D2R - mediated signaling must be intact if a mouse is to efficiently learn to associate a food reinforcer with a specific odor and then adaptively disengage inappropriate behavioral strategies following the reversal of reinforcement contingencies.

The comparatively poor skill of D2R - / - mice during discrimination trials suggests a role for D2Rs in acquisition of appropriate S + / S - relationships in operant associative learning.

However, only acute administrations of antagonists were given, and learning was not measured during complete D1R or D2R blockade [ 6].

Significantly, the reports cited above failed to address the technical limitations of the approach: i. e. that the antagonists used lack adequate subtype specificity and only partially blocked D2R - mediated signaling thus making it impossible to rigorously assess the role of D2R - mediated signaling in associative and reversal learning.

That D2R - mediated signaling orchestrates just motor components of learning is a conclusion that is potentially biased due to the practice of avoiding doses of drugs that induce catalepsy ( and therefore measuring only partial blockade of dopamine D2Rs) and single administrations [ e. g. [ 3]].

Future experiments measuring acquisition of associative learning in rodents that received chronic administration of D2R antagonists and demonstrated behavioral tolerance to their motor disrupting effects would be a logical test of this hypothesis.

Rather, we argue that this is not likely because the D2R - / - mice did learn to retrieve the food pellets from the dishes and eventually learned to accurately discriminate odors.

The inability of the D2R - / - mice to desist responding to a previously reinforced stimulus suggests that the dopamine D2R might in fact be the focal point of this error - signaling cascade.

[ 34] demonstrated that tetanic stimulation of dorsal striatum slices prepared from D2R - / - mice is associated with enhanced EPSP and as a result increased striatal synaptic efficacy.

The more common pattern ( type I) manifested itself as ectopic gene expression throughout the ONL, consistent with gene expression in all photoreceptors ( Figure 2; upper left photomicrographs).

This pattern of expression contrasts sharply with the usual pattern of cone gene expression, which consists of scattered cells localized to the scleral edge of the ONL ( Figure 2).

The second category of cone gene derepression ( type II) consisted of a patchy, salt - and - pepper pattern of ectopic expression in which individual positive cells were scattered throughout the ONL ( Figure 2, upper right photomicrographs; Table S1).

Note that in the wild - type retina, there is a relatively weak pattern of scattered positive cells at the scleral edge of the ONL, consistent with a cone - specific pattern of expression.

In the rd7 mutant retina in which such genes are widely derepressed, such a pattern of transcript localization often becomes apparent.

However, due to the weakness of the signal in some cases, or transcript localization to the inner segment in others, it was not always possible to determine with confidence which of the two patterns of derepression ( if either) each of these genes displayed.

Despite the derepression of S - opsin seen in the ventral portion of the rd7 retina, the normal dorsal repression of this gene is still present in this mutant ( unpublished data).

It is known that until P11, the cell bodies of cone photoreceptors in the mouse are normally dispersed throughout the ONL, only to relocate subsequently to the scleral edge of the ONL around P12 [ 23].

It is possible that in the rd7 mutant retina, there is a short delay in the relocation of the M - opsin - expressing cone cell bodies to the scleral edge of the ONL.

Despite this modest delay in the onset of rhodopsin expression, by P14 the gene had attained nearly normal levels in the rd7 mutant ( see Figure 2, lower left photomicrographs).

One gene, RIKEN cDNA 4933409K07 ( Figure 1, gene G47), was found to be up - regulated on microarray at all four timepoints examined.

Whereas there was only a barely detectable hint of expression in the inner nuclear layer ( INL) in the wild - type retina, this gene showed strong expression in the middle and vitreal thirds of the INL as well as patchy expression in the ganglion cell layer ( GCL) and at the scleral edge of the ONL in rd7 ( see Table S1).

This in situ hybridization pattern is consistent with staining in M u ller glia, the principal glial cell type of the mouse retina.

In order to assess the morphologic effects of the above gene expression changes, the ultrastructure of the photoreceptor cell bodies in the rd7 mutant was examined.

A comparison between the distribution of these cells and those expressing S - cone opsin strongly suggests that they represent the same cell population ( compare Figure 7D and 7F).

We have identified two patterns of cone gene derepression in the rd7 mutant retina, in agreement with a previous report by Chen et al.	"cone	35	39	Cell"	"gene	40	44	Sequence"	"mutant	69	75	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""gene"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
The first pattern of derepression identified ( type I) consists of ectopic expression of cone genes in the vast majority of cells in the ONL.	"cone	89	93	Cell"	"genes	94	99	Sequence"	"cells	124	129	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
These cells were also shown to coexpress all rod genes tested.

The second line of evidence derives from a comparison of the expression pattern of many type I genes in rd7 and Nrl - / - mutant backgrounds.	"genes	95	100	Sequence"	"Nrl	112	115	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutant	122	128	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Nrl"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
By ultrastructural criteria, these cells appear to be normal cones, albeit with displaced cell bodies.

Quantitation of these supernumerary S - cone opsin - positive cells indicates that they are approximately 2 - fold more abundant than in normal retina, consistent with previous antibody studies [ 17].

[ 19] found by RT - PCR that the levels of several rod - specific genes, including rhodopsin, were modestly reduced in rd7 at P28.

Nevertheless, previous studies have suggested that Fabp7 is expressed in radial glia and immature astrocytes in the brain [ 28 - 30].

Interestingly, they showed that this homolog appears to have a pan - photoreceptor pattern of expression early in development that later resolves into a rod - specific pattern of expression.

This early expression in cones may represent a mechanism whereby the expression of cone - specific gene products is temporarily repressed.

Further support for this idea has been provided by recent work in our lab showing widespread derepression of cone genes in the Notch1 - / - retina ( unpublished data).

While explanted P3 retinas express S - opsin and M - opsin with normal kinetics, explanted P0 retinas express only S - opsin [ 32].

This conclusion raises this question: Why does loss of a single transcription factor within rod precursors lead to two alternative fates -- a hybrid cell type on the one hand and apparently normal S - cones on the other?	"rod	92	95	Cell"	"cell	149	153	Cell"	"cones	201	206	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 149, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cones"", ""start_span"": 201, ""end_span"": 206, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
One test of the hypothesis that there are two temporally distinct rod precursor populations would be to carry out birthdating experiments to determine whether the supernumerary S - opsin - positive cells in the rd7 retina derived exclusively from an early - or late - born population.	"rod	66	69	Cell"	"S - opsin	177	186	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cells	198	203	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""S - opsin"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 186, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 198, ""end_span"": 203, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In this scenario, the absence of Nr2e3 would alter the probability that an unknown master control gene is expressed in rod precursors.

This conclusion is consistent with the evidence from human ESCS patients indicating a markedly reduced rod system and a lack of measurable rhodopsin by reflection densitometry [ 1, 2, 10, 11].

These findings, however, do not rule out the possibility that the abnormal human ERG derives from a hybrid photoreceptor cell type that also expresses S - opsin.

The final common feature between mouse rd7 and human NR2E3 mutants is the presence of an abnormally laminated retina with waviness and rosette formation in the ONL [ 12 - 15].

From the characterization studies completed thus far, the null mutation mouse accurately represents a model of classic MSUD and appears to be a faithful model of the human disease with respect to several biochemical phenotypes [ 1].

We show that expression of a human E2 transgene in the liver of these knockout mice is able to rescue the neonatal lethality.

The hallmarks of intermediate MSUD human patients are persistently increased levels of BCAA and BCKDH activity in the range of 3 - 30% of normal [ 1].

The transgenic approach that was used to create the intermediate MSUD model was based on the tetracycline regulated gene switch system that has been used with great success in other studies, for example [ 34].

The strategy behind our approach was to create mice with an intermediate MSUD phenotype that could be converted to the classic phenotype at the investigator ' s discretion by turning off the rescuing transgene.

While this is an interesting model, it is not a true model of MSUD because the mutation is not in BCKDH and the levels of BCKDH are normal.

However, due to practical constraints imposed by such a large animal model and due to the observation of differences between the MSUD cow model and MSUD humans [ 1], this model is also of limited utility.

The protein, Atrx, was ubiquitously expressed, and male embryos null for Atrx implanted and gastrulated normally but did not survive beyond 9. 5 days postcoitus due to a defect in formation of the extraembryonic trophoblast, one of the first terminally differentiated lineages in the developing embryo.

Thus, although Atrxnull ES cells could be recovered and maintained in culture by a conditional targeting approach, these cocultivation experiments suggested that the absence of Atrx does negatively impact upon normal ES cell growth.

While the cause of the proliferative delay is not yet clear, since Atrxnull ES cells appear to undergo higher rates of spontaneous differentiation ( unpublished data), it seems likely that the observed growth defect reflects the spontaneous transition from fast - cycling, undifferentiated ES cells into more slowly cycling, differentiated cell types in these cultures.

While this study has revealed an unexpected role for Atrx in the murine trophectoderm, as a result of the early lethality observed in Atrxnull embryos it is not possible to rule out other roles for Atrx at later developmental stages in tissues of the embryo proper.

Most interestingly, in the mutant footpads, where hair placodes do not normally form ( Figure 5G), we also found ectopic irregularly sized and spaced hair placodes, indicating that the footpads still have the potential to form hair placodes in the absence of the Apc gene ( Figure 5H).

Immunohistochemistry of normal thymus from P3 to P17 mice showed a similar staining pattern for K14 in that its expression was restricted to a small population of TECs in the inner medullary region and in the keratinocytes in Hassall ' s corpuscles ( Figure 6D).

It is possible that the apparent lack of Delta N87 beta cat function in embryogenesis could be due to the delayed or weak expression of the K14 - Delta N87 beta cat transgene compared to the intrinsic promoter.

Absence of teeth and mammary glands have been observed in mice deficient in Lef1 and ectopically expressing Dkk1 [ 29, 30] but their absence was due to the block in development before the bud stage.

In this study, we observed that K14 - driven loss of Apc resulted in a small thymus with severe squamous metaplasia leading to the formation of numerous pyogranuloma and loss of proper meshwork structure for thymocyte maturation, rendering the mice athymic.

There were individual differences among mutants and these were prominently reflected in the histological abnormalities of the thymus at P3, but as the older surviving mutants all showed the same histopathologies of the thymus, the mutant thymi eventually seem to result in the same fate.

The expansion and differentiation of these keratinocytes lead to loss of proper thymic epithelial compartments and in turn produced and deposited the hard keratins that consequently caused vast amount of neutrophils and macrophages to infiltrate the thymus.

We embarked on a series of experiments to identify the genetic lesion underlying this movement disorder and to identify a cognate disease and corresponding mutation in humans.

At initial examination, a human movement disorder specialist ( K.

Furthermore, this phenotype was similar, although less severe, to that described in a mouse line with targeted deletion of Itpr1, where ataxia was described as a prominent feature [ 4].

To further establish genetic deletion at ITPR1 as the cause of SCA15 we analyzed two additional families with an inherited cerebellar ataxia similar to that described in the AUS1 family, ascertained through neurology clinics in London, United Kingdom.

It is improbable that heterozygosity for the deletion of SUMF1, encoding sulfatase modifying factor 1, of itself causes or contributes to SCA15.

Currently, the small number of aged Itpr1wt / Delta 18 animals precludes us from examining these mice for subtle signs and symptoms similar to those seen in SCA15 patients; however, these mice are clearly of interest to us as a potential model of SCA15.
