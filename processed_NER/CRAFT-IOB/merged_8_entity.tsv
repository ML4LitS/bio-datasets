The photopic response in E2f1 KO mice was slightly reduced relative to WT ( Figure S5B), possibly because E2f1 is required for maximal expansion of embryonic RPCs, and the E2f1 KO retina has, as noted earlier, slightly fewer cells than the WT retina, although cell type proportions are unaffected ( D. C. and R. B., unpublished data).

"Thus, marginally subnormal photopic responses in the Rb / E2f1 DKO retina can be attributed to both a reduction of cone numbers in E2f1 KO mice alone, and a "" genuine "" slight reduction in cone function attributable to Rb loss relative to WT."

For example, in the P20 amygdala, E2f3 colocalized with the general neuronal markers Mtap2 and Mecp2 [ 52], but not with Calb2, which marks a subset of neurons, or with the glial marker Gfap ( data not shown).

In brain, Rb KO neurons migrate away from the ventricular zone and switch on Tubb3 ( beta III - tubulin), but continue to incorporate BrdU [ 13], and in gut epithelia, differentiated enterocytes migrate up the villi and activate expression of serotonin, yet continue to incorporate BrdU [ 67].
