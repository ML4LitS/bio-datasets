In contrast, neurite outgrowth of Bax - / - DRG neurons was significantly less ( see Figure 4G) than that of either DRG from TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos cultured in the absence of neurotrophic support ( see Figure 4D) or Bax - / - DRG neurons cultured in the presence of neurotrophic support ( see Figure 4H and 4I).

Moreover, to rule out the possibility that a differential effect may be due to the different genetic strategies by which expression of EWS - Pea3 in proprioceptive afferents is achieved, we performed this analysis both in Er81EWS - Pea3 / - and TauEWS - Pea3 / + PVCre / + embryos.	genetic,93,100,Sequence	EWS,135,138,Gene_or_geneproduct	Pea3,141,145,Gene_or_geneproduct	Pea3,232,236,Gene_or_geneproduct	Pea3,254,258,Gene_or_geneproduct	+,261,262,Sequence	+,271,272,Sequence	"[{""token"": ""genetic"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""EWS"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Pea3"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Pea3"", ""start_span"": 232, ""end_span"": 236, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Pea3"", ""start_span"": 254, ""end_span"": 258, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""+"", ""start_span"": 261, ""end_span"": 262, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""+"", ""start_span"": 271, ""end_span"": 272, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"	train

Moreover, PV was not expressed in DRG neurons of TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos ( Figure S5) but was expressed by proprioceptive afferents in both wild - type and Er81EWS - Pea3 / - embryos ( see Figures 1 and S5) [ 14].

Finally, to assess whether EWS - Pea3 expressed precociously acts exclusively cell - autonomously or whether it may also influence neighboring DRG neurons, we activated expression of EWS - Pea3 using Hb9Cre mice [ 33].

Together, these results and the findings obtained from in vitro culture experiments ( see Figures 4 and 5) demonstrate that precocious or isochronic expression of EWS - Pea3 in the same neurons leads to significantly different cell - autonomous cellular responses with respect to gene expression, neuronal survival, and neurite outgrowth ( Figure 9).

The fusion of EWS with Pea3 could circumvent a need for activation through specific cofactors while still maintaining ETS site dependence, thus rendering EWS - Pea3 less sensitive to the cellular context than endogenous ETS transcription factors.
