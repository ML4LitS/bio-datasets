The purpose of this study was to characterize gross lenticular morphology in normal mice and mice with the targeted disruption of alphaA - and alphaB - crystallin genes ( alphaA / BKO).

In the lens, alpha - crystallin also associates with type III intermediate filament proteins and the beaded filament proteins CP49 and CP115, and correct beaded filament assembly has been shown depend on the presence of alpha - crystallin [ 16].

In transfected CHO cells, alphaB has also been shown to ectopically localize to interphase nuclei, suggesting a role for this protein in the nucleus [ 19].

[ 22] demonstrated, by targeted disruption of the mouse alphaA gene, that this protein was essential for the maintenance of lens transparency, possibly by maintaining the solubility of alphaB, or associated proteins, in the lens.

In contrast to wild type lenses ( Figure 3L and 3Q), the alphaA / BKO lenses ( Figure 3B and 3G) contained large areas devoid of cellular material, their nuclei were not limited to a well defined equatorial / bow region, and ordered radial columns of elongating fiber cells extending from the posterior capsule to the anterior epithelium were not observed.

Cells adjacent to the posterior capsule of 5 wk alphaA / BKO lenses ( Figure 3E) exhibited nucleic acid staining, were small and non - elongated, with numerous membrane projections., These were, however, not observed in 54 wk alphaA / BKO lenses.

It must be noted, however, that the alphaA / BKO mice also lack the HSPB2 gene product [ 23] and the contribution of this protein to normal lens morphology and functions should not be overlooked.

Differentiation of epithelial cells occurs in the equatorial / bow region of the lens, where epithelial cells begin to elongate and differentiate into fiber cells of uniform cellular shape, arranged in radial columns of cells extending from the anterior epithelium to the posterior capsule.

Additionally, in lenses from 54 wk alphaA / BKO lenses, there was a persistence of cell nuclei in deeper cortical regions, and ectopic cell nuclei were present in large numbers in the anterior central cortex.

It is unlikely that these alterations in alphaA / BKO mouse lenses result from increased susceptibility of these lenses to light - induced damage in the absence of the molecular chaperone protection afforded by alphaA and alphaB in normal lenses.

AlphaB, expressed in transfected CHO cells, has been shown to ectopically localize to interphase nuclei, suggesting a regulatory role for this protein in the nucleus [ 19].

In the lens, alpha - crystallin also forms a complex with type III intermediate filament proteins and the lens - specific beaded filament proteins CP49 and CP115, which may be critical for proper filament assembly [ 16].

This part of the pocket, with the main chain of the protein quite distant from the substrate, is indeed not well conserved in these proteins, with kumamolisin missing it entirely due to a deletion in the corresponding sequence position.

Only the role of the latter mutation is completely clear, since it replaces the catalytic serine of CLN2 with a side chain that cannot support its enzymatic activity.

The reasons why the remaining mutations would lead to the loss of enzymatic activity are much less clear, but the wide distribution of these mutations in the structure supports the conclusion that any modifications to CLN2 that would abolish or impair its function could lead to the development of the disease.

The observation that an analogous peptide acetylated on its N terminus cannot be processed supports the postulate that the interactions of the N - terminal amino group with the side chain of Asp132 may be the most important feature defining the tripeptidase specificity of CLN2.

With the substrate - binding site of CLN2 resembling that of kumamolisin more than sedolisin ( the latter enzyme has low, if any, collagenase activity), the potential collagen - processing role of CLN2 might warrant further investigation.

Since the catalytic machinery of CLN2 matches closely that of sedolisin, kumamolisin, and other members of the family of serine - carboxyl peptidases, the enzymatic mechanism of all these enzymes is most likely the same.

Hematopoiesis in vertebrates, from zebrafish to humans, is an evolutionarily conserved program that produces two waves of stem or progenitor cells that differ both in their embryonic origins and in the lineages of differentiated blood cells produced ( Palis and Yoder 2001; Orkin and Zon 2002; Galloway and Zon 2003).

The presence of mutations in each of the mon alleles indicates that defective Tif1 gamma function is the cause of the mon phenotype.

Given that mammalian TIF1 gamma has been shown to form hetero - oligomers with Tif1 alpha ( Peng et al. 2002), we searched for additional TIF1 family members in zebrafish to compare with tif1 gamma.

The high levels of tif1 gamma expression in erythroid cells suggest that it functions as a cell - autonomous regulator of gene expression in hematopoietic cells.

Tif1 gamma is present in the critical genetic interval encompassing a single approximately 50 - kb PAC clone defined by linkage analysis ( see Figure 3).

In addition, tif1 gamma / Tif1 gamma is highly expressed in hematopoietic cells throughout embryogenesis in both zebrafish and mouse ( see Figure 4).

Although the mutations in each of these genes arrest cells at a similar stage of development, our results suggest that gata1 and tif1 gamma act independently.

However, in contrast to our original findings, the levels of the other two disease serological markers analysed ( anti - single - stranded DNA [ ssDNA] and anti - double - stranded DNA [ dsDNA] Abs) and the severity of the renal pathology were not different between the two experimental groups.

In view of the possibility of an association between the fixed 129 - derived segment flanking the mutated Apcs gene and the autoimmune traits observed, the genome - wide linkage analysis of the two experimental cohorts was carried out separately.

The quantitative trait linkage ( QTL) analysis identified several intervals on Chromosome 1 with linkage to disease serological markers, and these regions were all derived from the 129 mouse strain ( see Table 3; Figures 4 and 5).

At the end of the backcrossing, the 129 - derived Chromosome 1 interval in the congenic mice extended from microsatellite marker D1Mit105 to D1Mit223 ( 80 - 106 cM), which encompasses the most important 129 interval identified by the linkage studies in the ( C57BL / 6 x 129 / Sv) F2 mice.

Our results demonstrate interacting loci between 129 and C57BL / 6 mice that can cause the expression of a powerful autoimmune phenotype in these animals, in the absence of any gene - targeted mutations.

The same consideration applies to other genes located in the same Chromosome 1 region that have been implicated in the development of SLE when inactivated by gene - targeting in 129 embryonic stem cells and then backcrossed onto a pure genetic background ( Bolland and Ravetch 2000; Miwa et al. 2002; Wu et al. 2002).

In agreement with this, when we carried out a selective comparison between the ( 129 x C57BL / 6) F2. Apcs - / - mice and Chromosome 1 genetically matched controls, we failed to detect any significant difference in the levels of these two auto - Abs.

However, as the congenic mice and the Apcs - / - mice carried similar but not identical 129 regions on Chromosome 1, an alternative explanation for our findings may still lay in the numerous and complex synergistic and counteractive interactions between 129 and C57BL / 6 genes involved in self - tolerance and end organ damage.

In summary, we observed a wide range of ocular malformations in Ptdsr - deficient mice that ranged from differentiation defects in retinal cell layers ( for example, the inner granular layer) in mildly affected homozygotes to anophthalmia in severely affected Ptdsr - / - mice that was associated with induction of ectopic eye structures in nasal cavities.

The kinetics of cell death occurrence and regression of the interdigital web was similar in wild - type and mutant littermates, providing no evidence that Ptdsr - deficiency is associated with impaired clearance of apoptotic interdigital cells during limb development.

To investigate further whether removal of apoptotic cells is impaired in Ptdsr - / - mice, we stained immunohistochemically for activated caspase 3 ( aCasp3) and analyzed additional organs and tissues where apoptosis plays a crucial role in tissue remodeling during development.

To analyze whether macrophages are recruited into areas where apoptosis is prominent during embryogenesis, we stained consecutive serial sections either with the macrophage surface marker F4 / 80 or with aCasp3.

To determine whether macrophages from Ptdsr - knockout mice were impaired in the efficacy of apoptotic cell uptake in vitro, we performed phagocytosis assays with fetal - liver - derived macrophages ( FLDMs) and quantified their phagocytosis rates.	"macrophages	21	32	Cell"	"Ptdsr	38	43	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	55	59	Organism"	"apoptotic cell	93	107	Cell"	"macrophages	187	198	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cell"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 187, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Moreover, single Ptdsr - / - macrophages could be identified that had engulfed even more apoptotic target cells than had wild - type macrophages ( Figure 7b, d).	"Ptdsr	17	22	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"macrophages	29	40	Cell"	"apoptotic target cells	89	111	Cell"	"wild - type	121	132	Sequence"	"macrophages	133	144	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic target cells"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""wild - type"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Thus, Ptdsr - deficient macrophages had a normal ability to ingest apoptotic cells and were not impaired in recognition or phagocytosis of cells that had undergone programmed cell death.

Ptdsr - / - macrophages produced significantly less TNF - alpha than did wild - type macrophages.

In this study, we have generated a null mutation in the phosphatidylserine receptor ( Ptdsr) gene in C57BL / 6J mice.

Furthermore, we failed to detect any differences in the number of apoptotic cells in Ptdsr - knockout and wild - type animals in the rare cases where we could detect apoptotic cells within lung tissues.

In addition, Li and colleagues [ 31] demonstrated that surfactant expression is normal in Ptdsr - deficient animals, supporting the idea of normal maturation of surfactant - producing type II alveolar epithelial cells and lung function.

Other studies that connect the postnatal elimination of apoptotic photoreceptor cells to Ptdsr - mediated macrophage engulfment [ 43] should be interpreted with extreme caution as these studies were based on the monoclonal anti - Ptdsr antibody mAb 217G8E9 [ 26, 43] ( see below).

[ 32] analyzed TUNEL - stained sections of liver and thymus at days E13. 5 and E16. 5 of development in Ptdsr + / - and Ptdsr - / - embryos and found reduced rather than increased numbers of TUNEL - positive cells in Ptdsr - deficient embryos.

While the phenotype of Er81 KO mice is quite dramatic, and most proprioceptive axons stop within the intermediate spinal cord, it is important to note that a few axons still find their way to the ventral spinal cord and target properly to the motor neurons ( Arber et al. 2000).

Careful examination of Mcm4 / 6 / 7 footprints on a bubble indicated strong protection on the 5 ' - half of the top strand and moderate protection on the remaining 3 ' - half, as well as on several base - pair duplex segment adjacent to the branch point ( Figure 1A and data not shown).

These findings indicate that the Mcm4 / 6 / 7 complex is loaded onto DNA preferentially and efficiently through single - stranded region, regardless of the presence of 3 ' - or 5 ' - terminus.

These results indicate that the Mcm4 / 6 / 7 complex binds to single - stranded DNA and that its helicase is activated only in the presence of a single - stranded 3 ' - tail.

Thus, these results further strengthen our conclusion that the mammalian Mcm helicase is generally activated by the thymine - stretch on the 3 ' - single - stranded tail.

Our footprinting analyses showed that Mcm4 / 6 / 7 strongly protects 25 nt single - stranded DNA segment adjacent to each branch point and proximal to 5 ' ends of both strands of the bubble.

At each fork, one Mcm4 / 6 / 7 complex is likely to encircle the single - stranded DNA strand and two hexamers may bind symmetrically to the bubble substrate, forming a double hexameric structure on the bubble ( see schematic drawing of Figure 1A).

Huntingtin, the HD gene encoded protein mutated by polyglutamine expansion in Huntington ' s disease, is required in extraembryonic tissues for proper gastrulation, implicating its activities in nutrition or patterning of the developing embryo.

However, despite the potential importance of huntingtin ' s normal function to our understanding of how the dominant polyglutamine mutation causes HD pathology, huntingtin ' s precise molecular and cellular activities have not been defined.

Since extraembryonic tissues supply nutrients to the developing embryo, we tested the possibility that huntingtin deficiency may perturb this function by performing RT - PCR analysis to examine the expression of a panel of ' nutritive ' genes in E7. 5 wild - type and Hdhex4 / 5 / Hdhex4 / 5 huntingtin deficient embryos.

Similarly, the expression of Pem transcripts is maintained in mutant embryos ( D) similar to normal embryos ( C), although Pem is expressed in the abnormal lopsided overhang of visceral endoderm over the anterior of the mutant embryos.

Wnt and nodal antagonists, Dkk1 ( mdkk - 1) and Lefty1 respectively, are expressed in the AVE and are important in limiting the posteriorization of the anterior embryo by restricting Nodal and Wnt signaling [ 41 - 43].

Therefore, the ectopic expression of Nodal ( Fig. 3A - D) and the decreased Wnt3a expression ( Fig. 2H) in mutant embryos do not appear to be result of changes in the expression pattern of Lefty1 or Dkk1.

The absence of headfold formation in these embryos does not appear to be a result of a failure to induce neurectoderm or a failure to form the AVE, since mutant embryos express markers such as Otx2, Ddk1, Lefty1 and Hesx1.

Interestingly, Eed protein is also required for proper trophoblast development and normal maintenance of imprinted X - inactivation and genomic imprinting [ 47 - 49], suggesting that these activities warrant investigation in huntingtin deficient embryos.

Thus, our observations provide unexpected starting - points in the search for huntingtin ' s precise molecular activities, which began with the discovery that this HEAT domain protein hosts the dominant polyglutamine property that is the fundamental basis of HD pathogenesis.

The quest to understand the HD mechanism, therefore, is aimed at delineating the huntingtin activity that may explain the striatal cell specificity of the polyglutamine mutant version of huntingtin.

One hypothesis is that huntingtin is normally involved in gene transcription, as proposed for NRSF / REST mediated BDNF expression [ 54].

Now, our finding that huntingtin can be absolutely necessary for the appropriate regulation of genes with dynamic expression patterns in vivo, provides a compelling reason to elucidate the cellular machinery that is necessary for huntingtin mediated gene regulation.

Transgenic expression of GFPGluR - B in piriform cortex and hippocampus indeed rescued memory to an extent strikingly consistent with the transgenic protein levels ( approximately 10% of wild - type GluR - B), confirming the reliability of the correlation analysis and the sensitivity of the behavioral assay.

The transcript abundance values of these transcription factors ( n = 6) and an expanded group of antioxidant and DNA repair genes ( n = 16) were measured simultaneously by quantitative PCR in NBEC of 24 non - BC and 25 BC individuals.

Based on the above findings, it was hypothesized first, that there is inter - individual variation in regulation of key antioxidant and DNA repair genes by one or more transcription factors and second, that individuals with sub - optimal regulation are selected for development of BC if they smoke cigarettes.

In contrast, in BC individuals samples CEBPG was not correlated with any of the antioxidant or DNA repair genes.

None of the other transcription factors were correlated with XRCC1, ERCC5, GSTP1, SOD1, or GPX1 ( Fig. 1a, d, e, f).

However, there are alternative explanations for the observed correlation of CEBPG with antioxidant and DNA repair genes in non - BC individuals.

One possibility is that CEBPG and each of the correlated antioxidant or DNA repair genes is regulated by a transcription factor that is as yet undiscovered, and / or has a recognition site that is not yet known and was not in the Genomatix software database.

There also is more than one possible explanation for the observed lack of correlation between CEBPG and antioxidant or DNA repair genes in BC individuals.	"CEBPG	94	99	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"antioxidant	104	115	Chemical"	"DNA	119	122	Sequence"	"genes	130	135	Sequence"	"individuals	142	153	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""CEBPG"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""antioxidant"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""DNA"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""individuals"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The maintained correlation of E2F1 with DNA repair and antioxidant genes in BC individuals suggests that this function is more tightly controlled in the population and does not play a role in determination of risk for BC.	"E2F1	30	34	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"DNA	40	43	Sequence"	"antioxidant	55	66	Chemical"	"genes	67	72	Sequence"	"individuals	79	90	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""E2F1"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""DNA"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""antioxidant"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""individuals"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Clearly this would have survival value since DNA repair gene up - regulation in response to E2F1 provides additional DNA repair when the DNA is replicating and is particularly vulnerable to damage.

Compared to a standard APP transgenic line used for previous amyloid studies by our laboratory ( line C3 - 3; [ 15, 26, 27]), we estimated that the four controllable lines produce transgenic APP protein at 10 - to 30 - fold over endogenous levels ( Figure S1).

To ensure that A beta production was suppressed in concert with the dox - mediated inhibition of its precursor APPswe / ind, we measured A beta 40 and A beta 42 levels by ELISA in forebrain homogenates from young tet - off animals.

Consistent with the reduction in full - length APPswe / ind synthesis shown by immunoblot ( see Figure 1), we found that transgene - derived A beta levels were completely suppressed in animals born and raised on dox, and were sharply reduced following acute ( 2 wk) antibiotic treatment.

The ELISA data also confirmed that incorporation of the Swedish and Indiana mutations led to high levels of A beta 42, which we predicted would induce rapid plaque formation in untreated animals.

At older ages ( 9 - 12 mo) amyloid deposits were visible in the thalamus, which has also been observed in mice expressing mutant APP via the Thy - 1 promoter.

To confirm that the arrest of plaques without any sign of clearance was not unique to the line 107 mice, we repeated the dox - suppression experiment in a second line of tet - off APP mice ( CaMKII alpha - tTA x tet - APPswe / ind line 18; n = 22).

Filter trap analysis of line 18 tTA / APP mice yielded similar results: the increase in aggregated A beta observed in untreated animals between 6 and 9 mo of age was completely arrested by transgene suppression ( Figure S5C and S5D).

In all animals harboring amyloid deposits, we found that the vast majority of A beta ( > 99%) was extracted into the SDS and FA fractions ( Figure 5A and 5B).

In fact, levels of PBS - soluble A beta 40 and A beta 42 in the 6 mo + 3 mo and 6 mo + 6 mo treated cohorts were most similar to that of the 9 mo untreated cohort, suggesting that age, as opposed to synthetic rate ( which would be negligible in the treated animals), may determine the fraction of PBS - soluble A beta in these animals.

In order to understand the nature and extent of hyperactivity in the tTA / APP mice, we quantified daily activity levels in double transgenic animals along with their single transgenic and nontransgenic siblings using four - beam frames designed to monitor ambulation within an enclosed cage.

Two independent compounds tested in Tg2576 [ 33] and TgCRND8 [ 34] transgenic mice show no more than 85% suppression of A beta 40 levels, and where measured, even less suppression of A beta 42 ( approximately 60%) [ 35, 36].

Genes that show significant correlation with the gonadal fat mass trait and that have cis - eQTLs coincident with the fat mass cQTLs are potential candidate genes for the trait ( i. e., they may contain a genetic variation in that gene that is the cause of the trait cQTL).

Since these transcripts represent those significantly correlated with gonadal fat mass, the localization of their eQTLs to these regions strongly supports the notion that the genes with trans - eQTLs represent downstream targets of candidate regulatory genes located at the position of significant linkage.

To determine the regions of mr - s involved in transcriptional repression more precisely, the C - terminus portion was divided into two regions and each was fused to the GAL4 DBD ( Fig. 7A, DBD - tail, DBD - SAM).

Our results suggested that the C - terminal region of mr - s ( amino acids 463 to 542) is required for transcriptional repression of mr - s and the SAM domain appears to be dispensable for this repressive activity.

Taken together, our findings suggest that DBD - mrs functions as a transcriptional repressor and that the repression activity of mr - s is not due to a homophilic interaction through its SAM domain but to the C - terminal region ( amino acids 463 to 542).

We previously reported that Otx2 and Crx have a critical role in photoreceptor development and that Otx2 directly regulates Crx transcription [ 3, 9].

Furthermore, the luciferase assay demonstrated that Otx2 and Crx may directly upregulate the transcription of mr - s in mammalian cells.

Here we report the generation of additional mutant Xpd alleles that fail to support viability on their own but nevertheless ameliorate TTD - associated premature segmental ageing, cutaneous features, cellular DNA repair capacity, and UV survival when present in a compound heterozygote state.

We generated an Xpd knock - in allele with a point mutation encoding a single amino acid change ( XPDG602D) found in the XPCS patient XPCS2 ( Figure 1A - 1C).

Because patient XPCS2 was a hemizygote with mutant XPD protein ( XPDG602D) expressed from a single allele, the corresponding mutation was expected to be viable in the homozygous state.

Expression from the Xpd + XPCS allele was also reduced in the testis of compound heterozygous animals, whereas expression from the XpdTTD allele was increased relative to wt by ~ 5 - fold ( Figure 1E).

Despite reduced levels of mRNA expression, the homozygous lethal Xpd + XPCS allele ameliorated multiple XpdTTD - associated disease symptoms in compound heterozygous XpdTTD / + XPCS animals including the hallmark brittle hair and cutaneous features fully penetrant in homo - and hemizygous TTD mice ( Figure 2A - 2C).

Amino acid analysis confirmed that cysteine levels in the hair of the XpdTTD / + XPCS mice were significantly higher than in XpdTTD / TTD animals, but remained below the wt level ( Figure 2C).	"Amino acid	0	10	Chemical"	"cysteine	35	43	Chemical"	"mice	86	90	Organism"	"animals	138	145	Organism"	"wt	170	172	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Amino acid"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""cysteine"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""wt"", ""start_span"": 170, ""end_span"": 172, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
To determine whether the homozygous lethal Xpd + XPCS allele was unique in its ability to ameliorate symptoms associated with the XpdTTD allele, we generated compound heterozygous XpdTTD / + XP mice by crossing the corresponding heterozygous animals.	"Xpd	43	46	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"allele	54	60	Sequence"	"allele	137	143	Sequence"	"mice	194	198	Organism"	"animals	242	249	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Xpd"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""allele"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""allele"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 194, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 242, ""end_span"": 249, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Finally, none of the mutant TFIIH combinations ( carrying alterations associated with TTD [ XPDR722W], XPCS [ XPDG602D], or XP [ XPDR683W]) exhibited synergism in an in vitro NER reaction reconstituted with different mutant TFIIH complexes ( Figure 4D).

Notably, XpdTTD / + XPCS animals had a partial TTD hair phenotype, correlating with low levels of Xpd + XPCS expression, whereas XpdTTD / XPCS animals had wt hair, correlating with normal expression levels from the viable XpdXPCS allele ( Table 2 and unpublished data).

An overview of the functional relationships between Xpd alleles, phenotypes, and the presumed underlying TFIIH function in mice and cells is presented in Table 2.	"Xpd	52	55	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"alleles	56	63	Sequence"	"TFIIH	105	110	GO_ontology"	"mice	123	127	Organism"	"cells	132	137	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Xpd"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""alleles"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""TFIIH"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We used a genetically defined mammalian model system under controlled environmental conditions to reveal phenotypic effects attributable specifically to combinations of differentially mutated Xpd alleles.	"genetically	10	21	Sequence"	"mammalian	30	39	Organism"	"mutated	184	191	Sequence"	"Xpd	192	195	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"alleles	196	203	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""genetically"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""mammalian"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mutated"", ""start_span"": 184, ""end_span"": 191, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Xpd"", ""start_span"": 192, ""end_span"": 195, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""alleles"", ""start_span"": 196, ""end_span"": 203, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Secondly, highlighting the potential relevance of current findings to all diploid organisms including humans was the observation that in one compound heterozygous animal, the Xpd allelic relationship could shift from Adominant | arecessive to Arecessive | adominant with respect to different phenotypes in a time - dependent and tissue - specific manner ( see below and Table 2).	"organisms	82	91	Organism"	"humans	102	108	Organism"	"animal	163	169	Organism"	"Xpd	175	178	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"allelic	179	186	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""organisms"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""humans"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""animal"", ""start_span"": 163, ""end_span"": 169, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Xpd"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""allelic"", ""start_span"": 179, ""end_span"": 186, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
We observed differences in the ability of XpdTTD versus homozygous lethal Xpd + XPCS and Xpd + XP alleles to function in two transcription - related phenotypes separated in the organism by both time and space: embryonic lethality and terminal differentiation of enucleating skin and blood cells.	"Xpd	42	45	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Xpd	74	77	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"alleles	98	105	Sequence"	"organism	177	185	Organism"	"enucleating skin and blood cells	262	294	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Xpd"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Xpd"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""alleles"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""organism"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 185, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""enucleating skin and blood cells"", ""start_span"": 262, ""end_span"": 294, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In compound heterozygous mice, both homozygous lethal Xpd + XPCS and Xpd + XP alleles were able to alleviate XpdTTD - specific cutaneous and anaemic features and can thus be defined as dominant over the XpdTTD allele with respect to these phenotypes.	"mice	25	29	Organism"	"Xpd	54	57	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Xpd	69	72	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"alleles	78	85	Sequence"	"allele	210	216	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Xpd"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Xpd"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""alleles"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""allele"", ""start_span"": 210, ""end_span"": 216, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Unfortunately, the structure - function relationship between disease - causing mutations and XPD functional domains, including detailed structural information on XPD or even its stoichiometry within TFIIH, remains unknown.	"mutations	79	88	Sequence"	"XPD	93	96	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"domains	108	115	Sequence"	"XPD	162	165	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"TFIIH	199	204	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""mutations"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""XPD"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""domains"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""XPD"", ""start_span"": 162, ""end_span"": 165, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""TFIIH"", ""start_span"": 199, ""end_span"": 204, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
However, based on the ability of cell extracts that are defective in two different TFIIH components ( XPD and XPB) to complement NER activity in vitro [ 26], it is likely that TFIIH ( or its components) can either multimerise or exchange at least during the NER reaction.

Two or more cell lines per genotype ( except for the XpdTTD / + XP cells, in which only one cell line was used in repeated experiments) were used, and experiments were repeated 2 - 6 times per genotype.

Mice heterosomic for chromosomes 5 or 17 had rebleeding times similar to C57BL / 6J mice, but when these two chromosome substitution strains, B6 - Chr5A / J and B6 - Chr17A / J, were crossed, the A / J phenotype was restored in these doubly heterosomic progeny.

PAI - 1 antigen concentration was determined by ELISA [ 21] using sheep - anti mouse PAI - 1 ( American Diagnostica) as the capture antibody and mouse PAI - 1 ( American Diagnostica) as the standard ( 0 - 3. 5 ng / mL).

In order to determine if specific pathways were altered in the B6 and A / J strains, mice with known alterations in hemostasis, Lepob mice, or thrombosis, Plg - / - and PAI - / - mice, were also tested.	"mice	85	89	Organism"	"mice	134	138	Organism"	"Plg	155	158	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"PAI	169	172	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	179	183	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Plg"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""PAI"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 172, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 179, ""end_span"": 183, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Thus, the concentration of Plg in plasma from the A / J mice was higher than plasma from the B6 mice as determined by two methods and no difference in migration after electrophoresis was observed, suggesting no marked changes in the structure of Plg in the two mouse strains.

Components of the Plg system reside on chromosomes CSS - 5 ( PAI - 1), CSS - 11 ( alpha 2 - antiplasmin), and CSS - 17 ( Plg).

This abnormal organization of heterochromatin in Chaf1a - / - embryos is reminiscent of the heterochromatin organization found in two - to four - cell stage wild - type embryos ( compare Figure 1D and 1F).

p150CAF - 1 RNAi - depleted ES cells displayed a phenotype very similar to the cells of Chaf1a - / - E4 mice.

We also wondered whether loss of p150CAF - 1 in ES cells specifically affects the heterochromatin nuclear subcompartment, or whether it might result in a more global loss of nuclear organization and architecture.

In addition, Western blot analysis revealed that CAF - 1 depletion did not result in altered levels of chromatin architectural proteins such as histone H3 and HP1 alpha ( Figure S1).

In order to better characterize the defects in heterochromatin organization, we performed two - color DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH) experiments to reveal the spatial distribution of pericentric and centric chromosomal regions, which in mouse are mainly composed of large blocks of major and minor satellite repeats, respectively [ 20].

Quantification of fluorescence along a line randomly drawn across the nucleus revealed lower fluorescence intensity and a broader distribution of DAPI and major satellite hybridization signals in p150CAF - 1 - depleted cells ( Figure 4C and 4D), indicating decondensation of pericentric heterochromatin domains.

Given the known role of CAF - 1 in the deposition of histone H3. 1 and H4 associated with DNA synthesis [ 11, 12], we wondered whether this defect in higher - order chromatin organization could reflect an aberrant nucleosomal organization.

In a second series of experiments, we compared the association of histone H3 with chromatin in nuclei isolated from cells transfected with control and p150CAF - 1 RNAi plasmid vectors.

Our findings showed that the nuclear localization of HP1 alpha is severely altered in Chaf1a - / - embryos and p150CAF - 1 - depleted ES cells.	"nuclear	29	36	GO_ontology"	"HP1 alpha	53	62	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Chaf1a	86	92	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"p150CAF - 1	111	122	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cells	137	142	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""HP1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Chaf1a"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We show that in p150CAF - 1 - depleted ES cells, while DNA replication initially persists without significant perturbation in nucleosomal organization, severe heterochromatin organization defects can be observed.

Loss of p150CAF - 1 did not affect PML bodies in ES cell nuclei, showing that nuclear architecture is not generally altered.

This important function of CAF - 1 was not revealed in primary MEFs, 3T3 cells, or human cell lines, suggesting that it is specific of pluripotent embryonic cells.

Alternatively, early embryos and ES cells, whose genome is more plastic than somatic cells, might represent a particularly sensitive context in which the importance of CAF - 1 in heterochromatin organization is exacerbated.

We show here that CAF - 1, which is a H3. 1 replication - dependent loading complex [ 11], is specifically required for the nuclear organization of pericentric heterochromatin in embryos and ES cells.

Cloning experiments in mouse revealed that the nuclear organization of heterochromatin in ES cell nuclei was quickly reverted into the one - cell stage - specific form after nuclear transfer [ 40].

Moreover, deleting Ccnd1, which acts upstream of Rb proteins, also reduces RPC number, but does not suppress any defect in the Rb KO retina ( D. C. and R. B., unpublished data).

ERGs functionally assess visual signalling in the mammalian retina from photoreceptors to amacrine cells ( but usually not gangion cells), and are dominated by rod and cone bipolar cells.

The photopic response, a product of cone and mainly bipolar activity, was much reduced by Rb loss, but was rescued considerably in the Rb / E2f1 DKO retina ( Figure S5).

Thus, E2f1 deletion not only rescues morphology but also both rod and cone system function in the Rb KO retina.

Chat was seen in fewer cells in the mature Rb KO retina, and was present in the soma but absent from processes ( Figure 3B).

Finally, we also examined the effect of Rb deletion on SAC differentiation using a Chx10 - Cre transgene that is expressed in a mosaic pattern across the retina, generating patches of Cre - expressing cells [ 42].

Camk2a marks both SACs and ganglion cells [ 37], but because ganglion cells are eliminated in the Rb KO retina, Camk2a is a specific SAC marker in this context.

In mature WT SACs Slc18a3 is only in processes, but in early postnatal SACs, it is found in the cell body, and moves into emerging processes at approximately P4 - P6.

As noted above, Slc18a3 was absent at P18 in the Rb KO retina ( Figure 3A); at P4 or P5 it was in cell bodies, yet was rarely present in Rb KO processes ( Figures 4A and S6).

( A) Horizontal retinal sections of the indicated ages and genotypes were stained for nuclei ( DAPI, blue), mitosis marker PH3 ( green), and Slc18a3 ( red), which marks SAC soma at early stages and processes from ~ P5 onwards.

At multiple time points, E2f1 deletion suppressed ectopic mitosis ( PH3 + cells), but did not reverse the SAC defect, and E2f2 deletion had no effect on either defect ( Figure 4A).	"E2f1	25	29	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"deletion	30	38	Sequence"	"cells	74	79	Cell"	"E2f2	122	126	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"deletion	127	135	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""E2f1"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""deletion"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""E2f2"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""deletion"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
E2f3 deletion alone did not affect SAC differentiation ( Figure 4A); thus, it is unleashed E2f3 activity that is detrimental, and the critical role for Rb is to inhibit E2f3.	"E2f3	0	4	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"deletion	5	13	Sequence"	"E2f3	91	95	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Rb	152	154	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"E2f3	169	173	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""E2f3"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""deletion"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""E2f3"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 152, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""E2f3"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, in Rb KO SACs, E2f1 deletion suppresses ectopic division but not aberrant differentiation, whereas E2f3 deletion suppresses aberrant differentiation but not ectopic division.	"Rb	9	11	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"E2f1	21	25	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"deletion	26	34	Sequence"	"E2f3	105	109	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"deletion	110	118	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""E2f1"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""deletion"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""E2f3"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""deletion"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
The unique effect of E2f3 in disrupting the differentiation of SACs but not other retinal neurons might be due to cell - type - specific expression or cell - type - specific activity of E2f3.

This cytoplasmic E2f3 staining was also specific, as it was absent in the E2f3 KO peripheral retina of alpha - Cre; E2f3loxP / loxP mice ( Figure 5A).

Rb protein was also detected in the inner retina ( Figure 5A), and showed a similar distribution as E2f3 in SACs ( Figure 5B), and was also present in mature ganglion cells and M u ller cells as reported [ 51].

In agreement, we could not detect defects in cholinergic Rb KO neurons in the developing forebrain, but other Rb KO neurons in this region showed differentiation defects that were rescued by deleting E2f3 [ 53].

To verify the dual locations of E2f3 and to determine which isoforms were present in retina, we analyzed nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions by Western blot at different times during development.

Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from an equivalent number of retinal cells from mice of the indicated genotypes and ages were analyzed by Western blotting to detect the indicated proteins.

E2f1 was also detected in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, although unlike E2f3a it was predominantly nuclear both at P0 and P18 ( Figure 6).	"E2f1	0	4	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"nuclear	31	38	GO_ontology"	"cytoplasmic	43	54	GO_ontology"	"fractions	55	64	GO_ontology"	"nuclear	109	116	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""E2f1"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""cytoplasmic"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""fractions"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
E2f3a can trigger cell cycle induction, but because SAC defects are not linked to cell cycle perturbation ( Figures 3A and 4), and in view of the predominant association between E2f3b and Rb in quiescent cells [ 16, 19], we suspected that E2f3b may perturb differentiation in Rb KO SACs.

These data are consistent with the observation that E2f1 overexpression in newborn photoreceptors drives ectopic division and apoptosis [ 60], and add to the growing evidence indicating that E2f1 is the major, and perhaps only, member of the three activating E2fs required to induce apoptosis in Rb KO cells [ 10, 15].

Comprehensive marker analysis revealed that, in striking contrast to other retinal neurons, E2f1 deletion did not suppress defects in Rb KO cholinergic SACs.

E2f3 is expressed in a subset of CNS neurons ( this work) and drives specific cell - cycle - independent defects in Rb KO forebrain neurons [ 53].

The nuclear localization of E2f3b contrasts with that of other repressive E2fs in differentiating muscle, where E2f5 switches from the nucleus to cytoplasm, while E2f4 remains in both compartments [ 23].

It may be difficult to identify E2f3a - specific target genes or cytoplasmic proteins in SACs since these neurons are a small proportion ( < 1%) of the total retina and only ~ 5. 2% of amacrine neurons [ 38].
