Conversely, the BRCA2 defect in CAPAN - 1 could be fully responsible for the 100 - fold defect in recombination if the level of BRCA2 complementation observed by Powell was incomplete.

It is important to note that, from our ligand and gain - of - function transgenic studies, PPAR delta needs to be activated in order to direct the muscle fiber switch.	transgenic,71,81,Sequence	PPAR delta,91,101,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""transgenic"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""PPAR delta"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	train

A second model is that exercise may induce expression of PGC - 1 alpha ( Goto et al. 2000) and thereby activate PPAR delta.

However, because different members of this group often have similar effects on target cells and are produced in overlapping regions of the embryo and hence can be redundant with one another, removal of any single member of the BMP family may not reveal the full extent of the roles they play during development.	cells,86,91,Cell	BMP,227,230,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 227, ""end_span"": 230, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	train

As a consequence of the initial establishment of anterior - posterior positioned information within the limb by SHH and / or BMP signaling, the interdigital mesenchyme of the hand plate becomes specified in a graded manner.

This, in turn, prevents BMPs from downregulating fibroblast growth factor ( FGF) production in the AER [ 17, 22] and maintains the integrity of the AER itself [ 23].

Thus, conditional removal of BMP4 activity from the posterior limb mesenchyme results in a persistence of the AER, expanded SHH signaling, and consequent preaxial and postaxial polydactyly [ 16].

Similarly, when noggin, a potent BMP inhibitor, is introduced in early stage chick limb buds prior to skeletogenesis, mesenchymal condensation does not take place [ 27, 28].	noggin,16,22,Gene_or_geneproduct	BMP,33,36,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""noggin"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	train
Conversely, removal of individual ligands such as BMP4 [ 16] or BMP7 [ 12, 13] has not displayed defects in skeletal differentiation, presumably due to functional redundancy.

As all prior reported manipulations of the BMP pathway during skeletal development either result in a block at the first stage of chondrogenesis or allow complete skeletal formation, this is the first demonstration of a requirement for BMP activity in osteogenic differentiation.

This correlates with an anterior expansion in Shh expression ( Figure 3E and 3F, red bracket) and a concomitant expansion of the AER as visualized by Fgf8 expression ( Figure 3G and 3H, red bracket).

However, in Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre limb buds at E12. 5, Sox9 only detects primordia of the anterior three digits of the forelimb, indicating a failure in the formation of posterior digits at this earliest stage ( Figure 3J).

The loss of the posterior forelimb digits in these mice thus does not appear to represent a decrease in polarizing activity leading to a change in digit identity rather a consequence of the overall level of BMP signaling falling below a threshold for initiating chondrogenesis in the posterior of these forelimbs.	mice,51,55,Organism	BMP,207,210,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 207, ""end_span"": 210, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	train

The frequently observed subcutaneous edema of various extents in Ptdsr - deficient homozygotes gave us a hint that Ptdsr - deficiency and lethality might be associated with cardiovascular problems.

Indeed, very recently we have obtained strong evidence that Ptdsr - knockout mice die as a result of defects in heart development that are associated with specific cardiopulmonary malformations; ( J.

A possible explanation for these two phenotypes can be found in the expression pattern of the Ptdsr gene.

Interestingly, we occasionally observed serious malformations of forebrain and nasal structures in Ptdsr - knockout embryos that were associated with bilateral anophthalmia ( see for example the mutant embryo in Figure 1g).

This suggests that Ptdsr is involved in the regulation of differentiation processes within forebrain regions, and that ablation of Ptdsr function might secondarily affect early eye formation.

Li et al. proposed [ 31] that the eye phenotype they observed could be explained by failed removal of apoptotic cells during eye development, but we think that the observed defects are unrelated to a failure of apoptotic cell clearance.	apoptotic cells,102,117,Cell	apoptotic cell,211,225,Cell	"[{""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cell"", ""start_span"": 211, ""end_span"": 225, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test

Thus, besides the formation of the inner and outer layers of the optic cup in early eye development, other major phases of retinal cell apoptosis take place only postnatally and correspond to important periods in the establishment of neuronal connections.	cell,131,135,Cell	neuronal,234,242,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 234, ""end_span"": 242, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test

Whereas control mice reliably responded only to the previously rewarded odor ( memory of 86 +/- 8%, mean +/- SD, n = 9, Figure 2E), GluR - B Delta FB mice showed reduced olfactory memory ( 69 +/- 16%, n = 9, p < 0. 05, Mann - Whitney).	mice,16,20,Organism	mice,150,154,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test

A 9. 7% increase in GluR - B in these brain regions, as achieved by GluR - BRescue animals ( Figure 5), is thus predicted to increase olfactory memory by approximately 9% throughout the heterogeneous population ( blue line in Figure 6B).

No measure of discrimination and learning, on the other hand, correlated with residual GluR - B levels; even the smallest reduction in GluR - B levels ( about 20% - 60%) was sufficient to establish and saturate enhanced odor discrimination capabilities.

The full model ( Equation 6) allows us to model all heritable and sex - specific interactions in a single equation and maximally powers us to detect significant QTLs when the sex and sex - interaction terms are significant, given all 334 animals are included in the analysis.

However, because the full model contains two more parameters than the model that treats sex as an additive covariate ( Equation 4), the LOD score threshold for significant linkage is higher ( using the convention of Lander and Kruglyak [ 20]), with QTL - specific significance levels of 2 x 10 - 3 and 5 x 10 - 5 equivalent to LOD scores of 4. 0 ( suggestive linkage) and 5. 4 ( significant linkage, equivalent to genome - wide p < 0. 05), respectively.

Such aggregates, which are often found at the nuclear periphery, are also revealed by DAPI staining as a typical signature of p150CAF - 1 loss - of - function.	nuclear,46,53,GO_ontology	p150CAF - 1,126,137,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	test

The H3K9me3 mark [ 32] was also significantly reduced in p150CAF - 1 - depleted cells, though to a lesser extent than H4K20me3 ( Figure 7A and 7B).	p150CAF - 1,57,68,Gene_or_geneproduct	cells,80,85,Cell	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test

Given the major defects observed in heterochromatin organization, it is tempting to speculate that these defects cause the developmental arrest in the embryos and death in ES cells.	heterochromatin,36,51,GO_ontology	cells,175,180,Cell	"[{""token"": ""heterochromatin"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 180, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
