Transient transfection of an I - SceI expression vector results in the production of a DSB in the first mutated copy of GFP.

This raises the possibility that some or even all of the recombinational repair defect seen in CAPAN - 1 could be due to mutations at non - BRCA2 loci.

Taken together, the results indicate that BRCA2 is indeed required for high levels of recombinational repair in both human and mouse.

Expression of a single BRC repeat ( BRC4) had previously been reported to act as an inhibitor of DNA repair by Chen et al [ 27].

A BRC4 peptide was also reported to inhibit the RAD51 - DNA interaction.

The localization of RAD51 was examined in CAPAN - 1 cells, the same human tumor line examined by Moynahan et al [ 24].

Support for the hypothesis that the observed mislocalization of RAD51 is an indirect consequence of the BRCA2 defect requires reintroduction of functional BRCA2 into CAPAN - 1.	"RAD51	64	69	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BRCA2	104	109	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BRCA2	155	160	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""RAD51"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BRCA2"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BRCA2"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 160, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
An attractive alternative, favored by Davies et al [ 26], is that the association of RAD51 - BRCA2 is required to maintain RAD51 in a form that is in a state of ' readiness ' ( Fig. 2a).	"RAD51	85	90	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BRCA2	93	98	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"RAD51	123	128	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""RAD51"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BRCA2"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""RAD51"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In the absence of this interaction with BRCA2, RAD51 might exist in a form that is not capable of being recruited into a functional repair complex when damage occurs.	"BRCA2	40	45	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"RAD51	47	52	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"complex	139	146	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""BRCA2"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""RAD51"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""complex"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
This result could mean that regulatory factors, such as BRCA2, are required to suppress RAD51 - dsDNA interactions to prevent sequestration of RAD51 in a nonfunctional form.	"BRCA2	56	61	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"RAD51	88	93	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"RAD51	143	148	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BRCA2"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""RAD51"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""RAD51"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
It should be relatively straightforward to determine whether the role of BRCA2 is limited to transporting RAD51 to the nucleus.

However, biochemical experiments are needed to determine whether full - length BRCA2 blocks or promotes RAD51 - BRCA2 interaction.

We therefore wished to investigate the feasibility of non - invasive multiple reporter imaging in mice, and as a first step we wanted to ascertain whether we could establish viable and fertile mice with widespread expression of GFP variant reporters.

A breakthrough in the availability of spectrally distinct autofluorescent proteins came with the cloning of six anthozoan fluorescent proteins all having 20 - 30% identity to wtGFP [ 12].

Even though our RFP transgenic ES cell lines failed to maintain strong uniform expression with in vitro passage, we selected three lines exhibiting the most robust expression for making chimeras, in order to ascertain whether we could achieve, or possibly recover, RFP expression in animals.

A non - fluorescent morula was aggregated with two clumps of ES cells, one carrying the CK6 / ECFP transgene ( ECFP +) and the other carrying the YC5 / EYFP transgene ( EYFP +).

[ 3] of only a 29% loss of spiral sensory neurons at P4, our data show little difference in the pattern of innervation of the cochlea in P0 Brn3c null mutants ( Fig. 2c, 2d).

Formation of radial fibers that bring peripheral processes of spiral neurons to the organ of Corti seems to be rather normal, even in the apex of the cochlea which does not even develop immature hair cells recognizable by Myo VIIa.

With such a small number of cDNAs exhibiting a possible sign of DNA recombination ( a sign that could also be interpreted as chimeric cDNA clones), we conclude that such rearrangement is unlikely to occur.

Considering the 1, 392 olfactory receptor gene sequences for which reliable full - length data are available, 15 out of 285 ( 5%) apparent pseudogenes are represented in our cDNA collection, compared to 393 out of 1, 107 ( 36%) intact olfactory receptors.

We have thus validated the similarity - based prediction of over one - third of the intact olfactory receptor genes annotated in the mouse genome [ 1, 2], thereby vastly increasing the proportion of the family for which experimental evidence of olfactory function is available.

Before these questions about olfactory receptor gene choice can be answered, it will be important to measure expression levels of a larger number of genes, perhaps using an olfactory receptor gene microarray.

Alternatively, the multiplicity of transcriptional isoforms might have functional significance, as UTRs may contain signals controlling mRNA stability, localization or degradation [ 41, 42].

However, three separate groups have developed rabbit polyclonal antibody to mouse Abcg5 / sterolin - 1.

To investigate whether the defect in biliary sterol secretion could be ( partly) restored by forced biliary sterol secretion, we infused mice with stepwise increasing doses of tauroursodeoxycholic acid ( TUDC).

In the knockout mice, almost no stimulated sterol secretion was noted, with an intermediate phenotype in the heterozygous mice.

We report a mouse model of sitosterolemia, with a selective, but complete, defect in one of these genes, Abcg8.

For example, in humans, the activity of HMG - CoA reductase and CYP7a1 have been reported to be low [ 7, 39].

Arguably, since the body pools and plasma sitosterol levels in the knockout mice are so considerably elevated, perhaps the biliary sitosterol levels could be considered to be inappropriately low.

Sitosterol has been shown to directly inhibit Cyp7a1 activity in vitro and we presume this may account for the reduced enzyme activity [ 39].

This may be amenable to testing by placing these animals on a high plant sterol diet and measuring the plasma sterol levels.

In these studies the UTSW anti - Abcg5 / sterolin - 1 antibody was used.

This was achieved by targeted expression of an activated form of peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor delta ( PPAR delta) in skeletal muscle, which induces a switch to form increased numbers of type I muscle fibers.

This conversion of muscle fiber from type IIb to type IIa and type I is likely to be mediated by a calcium signaling pathway that involves calcineurin, calmodulin - dependent kinase, and the transcriptional cofactor Peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - gamma coactivator 1 alpha ( PGC - 1 alpha) ( Naya et al. 2000; Olson and Williams 2000; Lin et al. 2002; Wu et al. 2002).

A role of PPAR delta in muscle fiber was suggested by its enhanced expression -- at levels 10 - fold and 50 - fold greater than PPAR alpha and gamma isoforms, respectively ( unpublished data).

In agreement with the previous characterization of this promoter ( Brennan and Hardeman 1993; Clapham et al. 2000), the VP16 - PPAR delta transgene was selectively expressed in skeletal muscle, with 10 - fold less in the heart ( Figure 1C).

A diagnostic component of oxidative fibers is their high myoglobin and mitochondrial content, which is supported by the mRNA analysis shown in Figure 3A.

These effects appear to be direct consequences of PPAR delta activation, as levels of PGC - 1 alpha, a coactivator involved in muscle fiber switch and mitochondrial biogenesis ( Wu et al. 1999; Lehman et al. 2000; Lin et al. 2002), remained unchanged.

We found that transforming growth factor beta 2 signaling is necessary to transiently induce the transcription factor Snail and activate the Ras - mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK) pathway in the bud.

When E - cadherin is transcriptionally down - regulated, associated adhesion proteins with dual functions in signaling are released from cell - cell contacts, a process which we demonstrate leads to Ras - MAPK activation.

Consistent with the Western blot data, immunohistochemical analysis did not detect Snail in single - layered E13. 5 epidermis ( Figure 1C) nor in the placode, which is the earliest morphological sign of the commitment of multipotent cells of the embryonic ectoderm to a hair cell fate ( Figure 1D).

These hyperthickened areas were marked by excessive proliferation, as revealed by antibodies against the proliferating nuclear antigen Ki67 ( Figure 2D and 2E).

Activated, pMAPK - positive cells were also prevalent in these areas ( Figure 2F and 2G), as were cells expressing keratin 6, a keratin induced in the suprabasal layers of hyperproliferative skin ( Figure 2H and 2I).

Interestingly, similar types of alterations occur in the basement membrane in the hair bud of embryonic and newborn mice when Snail is normally expressed.

The fact that the basement membrane separating the epidermis from the dermis is altered only in the adult Tg animals suggests the involvement of intermediary factors not as readily available in the epidermis as they are in the follicle.

The ability to restore alpha - catenin expression and localization under these conditions argues against the notion that Snail transcriptionally represses alpha - catenin.

Consistent with our in vivo observations, transfected keratinocytes expressing Snail exhibited a substantial increase in pMAPK levels relative to control cells ( Figure 4D).

Given the increase in pMAPK staining in Tg skin, we examined the possibility that Ajuba might have changed its binding partner in Snail - expressing epidermis.

As expected, the small peptide inhibitor that interrupts the Grb - 2 / Sos association blocked the effects.

Thus, despite essential roles for Wnts and noggin in hair follicle specification [ 4, 29, 30], our studies did not support an essential role for these signals in governing Snail expression in keratinocytes.

TGF - beta 1 has been shown to induce Snail family members in hepatocytes and heart [ 15, 31].

In keratinocytes, however, TGF - beta 1 inhibits keratinocyte growth and seems to be involved in triggering the destructive phase of the cycling hair follicle [ 32].	"keratinocytes	3	16	Cell"	"TGF - beta 1	27	39	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"keratinocyte	49	61	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""keratinocytes"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""TGF - beta 1"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""keratinocyte"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Thus, we turned towards addressing whether TGF - beta 2 might be involved in regulating Snail expression in keratinocytes isolated from the basal layer of the epidermis.	"TGF - beta 2	43	55	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Snail	88	93	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"keratinocytes	108	121	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""TGF - beta 2"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""keratinocytes"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Interestingly, treatment of cultured keratinocytes with as little as 5 ng / ml of TGF - beta 2 caused a rapid and transient induction of Snail ( Figure 5B).	"keratinocytes	37	50	Cell"	"TGF - beta 2	82	94	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Snail	137	142	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""keratinocytes"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""TGF - beta 2"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The induction of Snail appeared to be specific for the active form of the growth factor, as pretreatment of TGF - beta 2 for 10 min at 100 degrees C obliterated the response [ Figure 5B, lanes marked ( -)].	"Snail	17	22	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"form	62	66	Sequence"	"TGF - beta 2	108	120	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""form"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""TGF - beta 2"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Within 0. 5 h of TGF - beta 2 treatment, Snail promoter activity had increased 3 - fold, and by 2 h, it peaked to approximately 10 - fold over control levels ( Figure 5D).	"TGF - beta 2	17	29	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Snail	41	46	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"promoter	47	55	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""TGF - beta 2"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""promoter"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Thereafter, Snail promoter activity rapidly returned to the basal levels seen in unstimulated keratinocytes.

To test whether TGF - beta 2 might be required for Snail induction in hair bud formation in vivo, we first analyzed whether TGF - beta 2 was expressed in or around the hair bud.	"TGF - beta 2	16	28	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Snail	51	56	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"TGF - beta 2	124	136	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""TGF - beta 2"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""TGF - beta 2"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This labeling appeared to be specific as judged by the lack of staining in follicle buds from mice homozygous for a TGF - beta 2 null mutation ( Figure 6A; [ 34]).	"mice	94	98	Organism"	"TGF - beta 2	116	128	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutation	134	142	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""TGF - beta 2"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutation"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
As judged by immunohistochemistry, Snail protein was absent from E17. 5 skin of TGF - beta 2 - null embryos but not from that of control littermates ( Figure 6C).	"Snail	35	40	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"protein	41	48	Chemical"	"TGF - beta 2	80	92	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""TGF - beta 2"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This effect appeared to be exerted at the transcriptional level, since Snail mRNAs were also not found in TGF - beta 2 null hair buds under conditions in which the signal was readily detected in the hair buds of littermate skin ( Figure 6D).	"Snail	71	76	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mRNAs	77	82	Chemical"	"TGF - beta 2	106	118	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mRNAs"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""TGF - beta 2"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Taken together, these results provide compelling evidence that TGF - beta 2 is functionally important for inducing Snail gene expression in a pSMAD - dependent manner in developing hair buds.

Guard hairs form in the absence of LEF - 1 and TGF - beta 2, and we have found that they also fail to express Snail at the budding stage of development ( unpublished data).	"LEF - 1	35	42	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"TGF - beta 2	47	59	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Snail	110	115	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""LEF - 1"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""TGF - beta 2"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
TGF - beta s are known to promote withdrawal of keratinocytes from the cell cycle [ 41].	"TGF - beta s	0	12	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"keratinocytes	48	61	Cell"	"cell	71	75	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""TGF - beta s"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""keratinocytes"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Although this phenotype is consistent with TGF - beta 2 ' s embryonic expression patterns [ 33], about 50% of TGF - beta 2 null buds appear unable to progress to the down - growth phase, a feature that cannot be explained readily on the basis of previously established effects of TGF - beta s.

In this regard, the positive effects of TGF - beta 2 on proliferation within the hair bud may be more analogous to what has been seen in progression of squamous cell carcinoma to metastatic carcinoma [ 43] rather than that typically observed for keratinocytes [ 44, 45, 46].

Moreover, our in vitro studies indicate that even sustained TGF - beta 2 exposure may cause only a transient induction of Snail, offering a possible explanation as to why Snail is so briefly expressed during hair follicle morphogenesis.	"TGF - beta 2	60	72	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Snail	122	127	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Snail	171	176	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""TGF - beta 2"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 171, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
An additional point worth mentioning is that prolonged expression of Tg Snail in postnatal skin resulted in morphological and biochemical signs of epithelial to mesenchymal transitions ( unpublished data), underscoring why transient Snail expression may be so important during normal hair follicle morphogenesis [ 18].	"Tg	69	71	Sequence"	"Snail	72	77	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Snail	233	238	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Tg"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 233, ""end_span"": 238, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
One obvious factor is the K14 promoter, which is elevated in the basal layer of the epidermis and the outer root sheath ( ORS) of the hair follicle, but is markedly down - regulated in developing embryonic hair buds as well as in the postnatal hair progenitor cells.	"K14	26	29	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"promoter	30	38	Sequence"	"cells	260	265	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""K14"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""promoter"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 260, ""end_span"": 265, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The K14 promoter is also less active in the ORS than epidermis and hence this might also account for the lack of apparent response of the ORS to ectopic Snail.

Previously, we discovered that early during hair follicle morphogenesis, E - cadherin gene expression is down - regulated concomitantly with the invagination of developing bud cells into the skin [ 4].

First, mitochondrial volume density is diminished in slow - twitch skeletal muscle of PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice.

Second, mitochondrial respiratory capacity is modestly but significantly altered in skeletal muscle and liver of PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice.

We did not find differences in food intake or activity levels in female PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice.	"food	31	35	Chemical"	"PGC - 1 alpha	72	85	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	92	96	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""food"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
It is possible that a reduction in systemic energy utilization, related to the mitochondrial dysfunction, leads to increased fat mass and weight gain in the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice.	"mitochondrial	79	92	GO_ontology"	"PGC - 1 alpha	157	170	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	177	181	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mitochondrial"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 170, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 181, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Consistent with this notion, we and others have shown that mice lacking the PGC - 1 alpha target PPAR exhibit resistance to diet - induced glucose intolerance [ 21, 35, 36].	"mice	59	63	Organism"	"PGC - 1 alpha	76	89	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"glucose	139	146	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
It is possible that PGC - 1 alpha plays an important role in lipid metabolism related to membrane synthesis.

During the preparation of this manuscript, Lin et al. reported an independent mouse line in which the PGC - 1 alpha gene was targeted [ 37].	"mouse	78	83	Organism"	"PGC - 1 alpha	102	115	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"gene	116	120	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""gene"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Third, we found evidence for an age - related increase in body fat in PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice ( females earlier than males), whereas Lin et al. identified a male - specific resistance to diet - induced obesity and insulin resistance.	"PGC - 1 alpha	70	83	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	90	94	Organism"	"insulin	215	222	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""insulin"", ""start_span"": 215, ""end_span"": 222, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, we observed that the insulin - sensitive phenotype of the female PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice occurred in the context of normal weight gain with high - fat diet.	"insulin	30	37	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"PGC - 1 alpha	74	87	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	94	98	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""insulin"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These latter results indicate that the insulin - sensitive phenotype of PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice cannot be fully explained by a lean phenotype.	"insulin	39	46	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"PGC - 1 alpha	72	85	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	92	96	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""insulin"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Fourth, the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice described here exhibit a dramatic fasting - induced hepatic steatotic phenotype, whereas the Lin et al. mouse does not.	"PGC - 1 alpha	12	25	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	32	36	Organism"	"mouse	141	146	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, the bulk of data presented here support the conclusion that the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice described are completely deficient in PGC - 1 alpha.	"PGC - 1 alpha	73	86	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	93	97	Organism"	"PGC - 1 alpha	136	149	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Our results also suggest a broader role for inducible transcriptional coactivators such as PGC - 1 alpha in transducing cellular signals triggered by physiologic and developmental cues to the transcriptional control of energy metabolism and other dynamic cellular processes.	"PGC - 1 alpha	91	104	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cellular	120	128	Cell"	"cellular	255	263	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cellular"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cellular"", ""start_span"": 255, ""end_span"": 263, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Indeed, although PGC - 1 alpha null mice survive in the protected environment of the laboratory, our results indicate that in the rigors of a typical external environment, PGC - 1 alpha would be necessary for survival.	"PGC - 1 alpha	17	30	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	36	40	Organism"	"PGC - 1 alpha	172	185	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 172, ""end_span"": 185, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Lastly, we propose that the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice should serve as a useful murine model to investigate the role of altered energy metabolism in obesity, diabetes, hepatic steatosis, and diseases of the heart, skeletal muscle, and central nervous system.

In the present study we focus on the distribution of Annexin A7 in the developing brain of mice embryos between E5 and E16, and in the adult mouse brain.

At the subcellular level, Annexin A7 was present in punctate structures mainly in the cytosol of all examined cells ( Fig. 2E, F).

Annexin A7 is expressed in both cell types of the egg cylinder with a strong staining of the endoderm and a weaker staining of the ectoderm.

Next we analysed the cellular and subcellular distribution of Annexin A7 in the developing mouse brain ( Fig. 3).

During further development the immature cells have rounded up two days later, but they retain Annexin A7 in the cytosol at E15 ( Fig. 3C, F).

( C) Two days later at E15 the cells have rounded up, and Annexin A7 stays in the cytosol.

In the neocortex ( isocortex) Annexin A7 was strongly enriched in nuclei of neurons of all six cortical laminae ( Fig. 4A, section derived from cortex temporalis).

( A) Low magnification of the cortex temporalis presents an Annexin A7 expression in cells of the pial border, in neurons of all six isocortical laminae, and a weak signal in the adjacent white matter.

When we analyzed the pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus at a higher magnification we found that Annexin A7 again mainly localized to the nuclei ( Fig. 4G).	"pyramidal neurons	21	38	Cell"	"Annexin A7	98	108	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"nuclei	139	145	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""pyramidal neurons"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Annexin A7"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""nuclei"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
In another actual study of the knock out mouse we detected a thickened basal membrane and a widened intercellular space.

The specificity of the Annexin A7 signal was further confirmed in similar brain sections of the AnxA7 - / - mouse ( Fig. 5F).	"Annexin A7	23	33	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"AnxA7	96	101	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mouse	108	113	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Annexin A7"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""AnxA7"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Thus, the intense stain of the cerebellar white matter arises from Annexin A7 located in astrocytes and neurites.

The positive Annexin A7 - stain in the stratum granulosum is due to staining of the nuclei of neurons.

The neurons lacked a signal for Annexin A7 in their nuclei.

Likewise, in these neuronal and astroglial cell lines Annexin A7 had been observed in the nucleus by immunofluorescence ( Fig. 7B and data not shown).	"neuronal and astroglial cell	19	47	Cell"	"Annexin A7	54	64	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"nucleus	90	97	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""neuronal and astroglial cell"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Annexin A7"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""nucleus"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Cells in the stratum germinativum of the neopallial cortex, which surrounds the lateral ventricle, show at E13 and E15 a staining for Annexin A7 mainly in the cytosol.

But this staining largely disappears and at the following day E16 we detect Annexin A7 in the nucleus of cells in the intermediate and marginal zone of the neopallium.

Neurons that are generated prenatally in the proliferative ventricular layer of the neopallial cortex subsequently migrate through the intermediate zone to form the different cortical cell layers in a declining inside - out gradient of cell maturation.

To determine if this is due to different methods in immunofluorescence staining or indeed different expression patterns in mouse and human, we repeated the immunofluorescence of human brain.

The astroglial expression of Annexin A7 could be confirmed, although not all astrocytes exhibited the nuclear staining.

Many important aspects of neuronal character appear to be acquired through the expression of transcription factors at progenitor cell stages, whereas others depend on expression immediately upon cell cycle exit [ 1].

The differentiation of sensory neurons of dorsal root ganglia ( DRG) has been studied extensively with respect to inductive events that specify neuronal fate [ 2, 3], as well as the involvement of late target - derived neurotrophic factors in the control of neuronal survival [ 4].

These studies, for example, have revealed that neurotrophin signaling controls the acquisition of peptidergic traits in nociceptive DRG neurons and the control of target innervation [ 8, 9].

The onset of some transcriptional programs in neurons, however, has also been shown to occur long after neurons exit the cell cycle.

Moreover, the induction of Er81 expression in proprioceptive afferents is known to be mediated by peripheral neurotrophin 3 ( NT - 3) [ 9].

Using both assays, we found extensive rescue of the projections into the ventral horn of the spinal cord in Er81EWS - Pea3 / - mice ( Figure 2C and 2F).

To address the consequences of precocious ETS signaling for proprioceptive afferent differentiation, we next expressed EWS - Pea3 in DRG neurons as soon as they became post - mitotic.

Sensory afferents in TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos also bifurcated at the entry point, although approximately 5% of afferent fibers continued to grow towards the midline ( Figure 3O and 3Q).

Neither the pattern of neurite outgrowth nor neuronal survival changed significantly after application of either NGF or NT - 3 ( Figure 4E and 4F).

Together, these findings suggest that only precocious but not isochronic ETS signaling in DRG neurons is capable of uncoupling survival and neurite outgrowth from a requirement for neurotrophin signaling normally observed in wild - type DRG.

Our data indicate that DRG neurons undergo a temporal change in their competence to respond to ETS transcription factor signaling, as assessed by changes in gene expression and axonal target invasion ( Figure 9).

This temporally delayed and target - induced upregulation of ETS transcription factor expression several days after a neuronal lineage of a specific identity first emerges is not restricted to DRG sensory neurons, but is also found in motor neuron pools [ 13].

Thus, both in Drosophila and vertebrates, target - derived factors appear to act permissively to induce the expression of transcriptional programs involved in terminal neuronal maturation.

Recent experiments addressing the temporal constraints of transcription factor action in proliferating neural progenitor cells adds to the idea that defined temporal windows, during which transcription factors act to control distinct downstream target genes, are of key importance to neuronal fate acquisition.

One explanation for this phenomenon is that Sam68 function is sub - served by one or more of its family members during development such as SLM - 1 and SLM - 2 [ 47].

However, it is still possible, that a mild impairment in Sam68 - / - mice osteoclast function may manifest itself later in life in overall accumulation of bone and this will require further detailed studies.

We report here that Capn2 - / - mice, which lack the m - calpain catalytic subunit, die at the preimplantation stage of development.

Since homozygous disruption of the Capn4 gene was also expected to abolish m - calpain activity, this result is in agreement with the phenotype presented by one of the two Capn4 targeted lines in which preimplantation lethality of null embryos was also observed [ 32].

In contrast, the Capn4 targeting strategy employed by Zimmerman and colleagues involved a much more extensive deletion of exons 4 through 8 [ 32].

For example, three different targeting strategies were independently used to disrupt the mixed lineage leukemia ( Mll) gene.

The variation in phenotype was attributed to the differences in degree of function of the truncated proteins produced from the mutant alleles.

On the other hand, since they require different amounts of Ca2 + for in vitro activation, it is possible that the two isoforms are differentially regulated inside cells.

Compensation for mu - calpain deficiency by m - calpain is therefore less likely in platelets and erythrocytes than in other cell types.

The association between calpain and cell viability has been noted in Capn4 - / - MEFs and other cell lines, although the reported work frequently did not distinguish between mu - and m - calpain, and did not show that calpain was strictly essential [ 5, 6].

m - calpain was implicated in the acrosome reaction [ 47] which correlated with a translocation of m - calpain to the cortical membrane in oocytes where it might participate in the release of cortical granule contents required to prevent polyspermy [ 45].

m - calpain also relocalized to the oocyte meiotic spindle after fertilization, were it could be involved in chromosome segregation [ 45].

For example, ADAM10, ADAM17 and ADAM19 are critical for normal development by providing growth signals at the correct times and places [ 3 - 6].

To study the functions of ADAM11 in the cerebellum, we examined the motor function of ADAM11 - deficient mice using a rotating rod task [ 28].	"ADAM11	26	32	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"ADAM11	86	92	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	105	109	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""ADAM11"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""ADAM11"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
On the other hand, in the visible platform version, in which the motor ability and visual acuity of the mouse are tested, ADAM11 - defieient mice were normal.

On the other hand, in the visual platform version of the water maze task, motor ability for swimming in ADAM11 - deficient mice was normal.

Therefore, electrophyological studies to enable analysis of synaptic transmission and plasticity in the hippocampus and cerebellum of ADAM11 - deficient mice will be needed.	"synaptic	60	68	GO_ontology"	"ADAM11	134	140	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	153	157	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""synaptic"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""ADAM11"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These studies might clarify whether ADAM11 plays an important signalling or structural role at the synaptic level and whether it participates in synaptic regulation.

On the other hand, mice lacking the Adam22 gene showed severe ataxia, exhibited marked hypomyelination of the peripheral nerves, and died before weaning [ 22].

These findings suggest that ADAM11, ADAM22 and ADAM23 have separate and important roles in the nervous system.

Therefore, the obesity QTL in the HG2M unique region ( Region IV) is profoundly impacted by the presence of hg.

The effects appeared to be the result of two linked QTL, Carfhg2 at 10 cM and Feml2 at 20 cM, instead of one pleiotropically impacting both traits ( Table 1).

In confirmation of Carfhg2 all measures of adiposity in HG9 mice were increased relative to control mice; except MFP in both sexes and BMI in males ( Table 5).

Using this information we increased the density of markers in each QTL region ( MMU1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 11 and 17; Table 1 and Additional File 1), ensuring the absence of CAST alleles at each of these QTL.

In addition to the large number of MMU2 QTL, the presence of hg adds complexity by either eliciting interactions with the same QTL or by inducing the expression of novel QTL.

Originally, Q1Ucd1 had small effects and these results illustrate the power of congenic strain analysis to isolate small effect QTL, although it is likely this QTL represents the lower boundary of detection using only 20 - 30 congenic mice.

A limited number of studies have identified variation within CAST coding sequence; so sequencing candidates gave us the opportunity to estimate the SNP frequency in coding sequence relative to B6.

In mammals, Sox9 is up - regulated immediately after Sry expression initiates.

Based on the theory that Sertoli cells initiate all downstream testicular differentiation, this might imply that Sertoli differentiation had been initiated in Wnt4 - / - XX gonads.	"Sertoli cells	25	38	Cell"	"Sertoli	113	120	Cell"	"Wnt4	159	163	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Sertoli cells"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Sertoli"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Wnt4"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 163, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, expression of Sertoli cell markers was not previously detected in these mutants during fetal stages [ 8, 29], leading to the conclusion that Wnt4 was not involved in primary sex determination in the gonad.

We also demonstrate that FGF9 represses the ovary - promoting gene, Wnt4.

WNT4 seems to oppose the male pathway by repressing expression of SOX9 and FGF9.

However, by 12. 5 dpc, FGF9 was detected only in XY gonads in two domains: in cells near the surface of gonads and in cells located within testis cords.	"FGF9	23	27	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cells	78	83	Cell"	"cells	118	123	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""FGF9"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The early expression of Fgf9 in bipotential gonads raised the question of whether Fgf9 is an upstream regulator of Sry.	"Fgf9	24	28	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Fgf9	82	86	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Sry	115	118	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Fgf9"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Fgf9"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Sry"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Normally, Sox9 is weakly expressed in wild - type genital ridges of both XX and XY embryos at 10. 5 dpc and, after the onset of Sry expression, is up - regulated in XY gonads [ 5, 33, 16].	"Sox9	10	14	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"wild - type	38	49	Sequence"	"Sry	128	131	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Sox9"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""wild - type"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Sry"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Primary cell culture and gonad culture systems were used to assess Sox9 activation by exogenous FGF9.	"cell	8	12	Cell"	"Sox9	67	71	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"FGF9	96	100	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Sox9"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""FGF9"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
To test the local effect of FGF9, we modified the XX gonad culture by stably immobilizing FGF9, or BSA as a control, on beads ( Figure 2I - 2K).	"FGF9	28	32	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"FGF9	90	94	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BSA	99	102	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""FGF9"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""FGF9"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BSA"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Under these conditions, SOX9 expression was up - regulated locally in cells near the surface of the XX gonad in contact with the FGF9 bead ( Figure 2K).	"SOX9	24	28	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cells	70	75	Cell"	"FGF9	129	133	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""SOX9"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""FGF9"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
These findings also indicate that expression of Sry is not sufficient to regulate Fgf9 in the absence of Sox9.	"Sry	48	51	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Fgf9	82	86	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Sox9	105	109	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Sry"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Fgf9"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Sox9"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Like Fgf9 Mutant Gonads, Sox9 Delta / Delta XY Gonads Show Defects in Cell Proliferation	"Fgf9	5	9	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Mutant	10	16	Sequence"	"Cell	70	74	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Fgf9"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Mutant"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Cell"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Proliferating cells were more abundant and concentrated in a domain near the surface of wild - type XY gonads, and this XY - specific cell proliferation was evident in XY Sox9flox / Delta littermate controls ( Figure 3K).	"cells	14	19	Cell"	"wild - type	88	99	Sequence"	"cell	134	138	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""wild - type"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Based on the fact that Sox9 is initially expressed in Fgf9 - / - gonads, we investigated whether other genes in the male pathway are activated.	"Sox9	23	27	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Fgf9	54	58	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"genes	103	108	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Sox9"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Fgf9"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Dhh, which is expressed in XY wild - type and heterozygous gonads beginning at 11. 5 dpc, was absent from Fgf9 - / - XY gonads, although mesonephric expression was still detected ( Figure 4A and 4B).	"Dhh	0	3	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"wild - type	30	41	Sequence"	"Fgf9	106	110	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Dhh"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""wild - type"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Fgf9"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Amh, which is a direct transcriptional target of SOX9 activated after 11. 5 dpc [ 38, 40], was detected at reduced levels in Fgf9 - / - XY gonads at 12. 5 dpc ( Figure 4C - 4F).	"Amh	0	3	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"SOX9	49	53	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Fgf9	125	129	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Amh"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""SOX9"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Fgf9"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, SOX9 expression in XY Fgf9 - / - gonads rapidly disappeared ( Figure 3E and 3F), and other Sertoli markers were absent or severely reduced ( Figure 4A - 4F).	"SOX9	9	13	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Fgf9	31	35	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Sertoli	100	107	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""SOX9"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Fgf9"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Sertoli"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
An antibody against SOX9 revealed that expression was initially up - regulated in Wnt4 - / - XX gonads at 11. 5 dpc ( Figure 6F and 6I), although it was rapidly down - regulated by 12. 0 dpc and absent at 12. 5 dpc ( Figure 6I and 6L).	"antibody	3	11	GO_ontology"	"SOX9	20	24	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Wnt4	82	86	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""antibody"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""SOX9"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Wnt4"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We suggest that in the absence of the antagonizing activity of FGF9, WNT4 signals predominate and govern somatic cell fate in the gonadal field.	"FGF9	63	67	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"WNT4	69	73	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cell	113	117	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""FGF9"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""WNT4"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
However, mosaic studies have shown that the genetic sex of the cells in the anterior / posterior organizers of the disk, not the sex of the majority of cells in the disk, regulate the sexually dimorphic fate of the disk.	"genetic	44	51	Sequence"	"cells	63	68	Cell"	"cells	152	157	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""genetic"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 152, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This occurs through the sex - specific regulation of WNT, FGF, and transforming growth factor beta signaling, which in turn regulate the growth, cell differentiation, and morphogenesis of the disk [ 41, 42].	"FGF	58	61	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"transforming growth factor beta	67	98	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cell	145	149	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""FGF"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""transforming growth factor beta"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The interplay between cell - autonomous and non - cell - autonomous pathways in the mammalian gonad is not well understood.	"cell	22	26	Cell"	"cell	50	54	Cell"	"mammalian	84	93	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""mammalian"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In XX <--> XY chimera experiments, XX cells can be recruited to the Sertoli lineage, indicating that non - cell - autonomous signaling mechanisms operate under these conditions [ 15].	"cells	38	43	Cell"	"Sertoli	68	75	Cell"	"cell	107	111	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Sertoli"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
However, FGF9 may act to trigger cell proliferation, increasing the number of Sertoli precursors above a threshold needed to stabilize the male pathway, consistent with threshold requirements deduced from earlier studies using XX <--> XY chimeric gonads [ 15].	"FGF9	9	13	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cell	33	37	Cell"	"Sertoli	78	85	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""FGF9"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Sertoli"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Here we show that the addition of FGF9 protein to XX gonad explant cultures repressed the expression of Wnt4.	"FGF9	34	38	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"protein	39	46	Chemical"	"Wnt4	104	108	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""FGF9"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""Wnt4"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Down - regulation of Wnt4 is unlikely to occur through SOX9, as SOX9 is not up - regulated in this situation [ 7].	"Wnt4	21	25	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"SOX9	55	59	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"SOX9	64	68	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Wnt4"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""SOX9"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""SOX9"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
These findings support the idea that FGF9 acts as the antagonist of Wnt4.

In Wnt4 mutants, SOX9 expression is not maintained.

In light of the observation that the Wnt4 - / - XX gonad does not increase significantly in size ( Figure 6), it is possible that the FGF9 / SOX9 - expressing population did not reach a critical threshold.	"Wnt4	37	41	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"FGF9	134	138	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"SOX9	141	145	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Wnt4"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""FGF9"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""SOX9"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Sry is not present in nonmammalian systems; however, antagonistic signaling between FGFs and WNTs may be the conserved mechanism that balances the gonad between testicular and ovarian fates in vertebrates.

In mammalian XY gonads, the onset of Sry expression initiates the male pathway by up - regulating Sox9.

To facilitate targeting at the p53 locus, we developed an improved Recombinase - Mediated Cassette Exchange ( RMCE) method.

Our approach enables efficient targeting in ES cells to facilitate the production of mutant mice.

RMCE - ASAP combines inverted heterologous recombinase target sites, a positive / negative selection marker that preserves the germline capacity of ES cells, and the power of mouse genetics.	"inverted heterologous recombinase target sites	21	67	Sequence"	"cells	151	156	Cell"	"mouse	175	180	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""inverted heterologous recombinase target sites"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 151, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 180, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The strength of this approach is that mutations are tested in a genomic setting and expressed from the endogenous promoter, ensuring physiological expression levels and correct spatio - temporal profiles.	"mutations	38	47	Sequence"	"genomic	64	71	Sequence"	"promoter	114	122	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""mutations"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""genomic"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""promoter"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
However, modeling most disease - associated mutations requires generating subtle mutations, not knock - outs or reduced expression alleles.

For example, exchanges using cassettes with directly repeated loxP sites were inefficient because excisions dominated the intended exchanges ( 8).

However, interference resulting from expression of the selection marker and the endogenous gene ( 13) necessitates strategies to remove the selectable gene.

The RMCE strategy presented here relies on the integrated use of inverted heterologous loxP sites, a positive / negative selection marker that preserves the germline capacity of ES cells, and the power of mouse genetics to expedite phenotypic analyses.

As expected, the PRD deletion correlated with lower expression levels: p53 Delta PGFP was much less abundant than p53WT in all p53 + / Delta PGFP clones ( Figure 3B).

Importantly, this allowed us to generate p53RMCE / - MEFs, which were used to test RMCE at the p53 locus in somatic cells.

RMCE with p53GFP in ES cells showed that p53GFP is expressed at high levels ( Figure 3A), and as mentioned before, the p53 pathway that can be activated in MEFs is not readily activated in ES cells ( 18).

To test this possibility, p53RMCE / - MEFs were electroporated with the p53GFP replacement construct with or without a Cre - expression plasmid, then analyzed by fluorescence microscopy 48 h after electroporation.

The specific interaction of RanBP2 with a diverse set of partners likely reflects a pleiotropic role of RanBP2 in cell function, possibly through the integration of multiple pathways.

The data support that Cox1 and HKI are novel partners in vivo for the large LD of RanBP2 ( Figures 1 and 2).

The LD of RanBP2 exhibits chaperone activity toward folding intermediates of Cox11, and possibly, the mature HKI ( Figure 1).

The data herein show that the multi - chaperone role of RanBP2 extends also to its LD in light of its ability to associate to distinct folding species of Cox11 and to prevent HKI from being degraded.

In Alk5 / Wnt1 - Cre mutants the characteristic rotation of the aortic sac and truncal OFT fails to take place ( Fig. 6G - L), and a properly formed AP - septum was not detectable ( Fig. 6G, H).	"Alk5	3	7	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Wnt1	10	14	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutants	21	28	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Alk5"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Wnt1"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutants"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Recently, we showed that the NC - specific mutants of the related type I receptor, Alk2, display PTA as well [ 12].

To conclude, while both Alk2 and Alk5 mutants demonstrate a failure in both the rotation of the aortic sac and the truncal OFT, and in the formation of the AP septum, the pathogenetic mechanisms behind these defects appear remarkably different.	"Alk2	24	28	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Alk5	33	37	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutants	38	45	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Alk2"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Alk5"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutants"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
The truncal OFT fails to rotate in Alk5 / Wnt1 - Cre mutants.

As described above, Alk5 / Wnt1 - Cre mutants displayed an inadequate amount of AP - septal tissue in the base of the aortic sac between the origins of 4th and 6th PAAs.	"Alk5	20	24	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Wnt1	27	31	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutants	38	45	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Alk5"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Wnt1"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutants"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
While CNCC proliferation was not affected in Alk5 mutants ( data not shown), we could detect a dramatic increase in the number of TUNEL positive cells in tissues surrounding the aortic sac including the site where the AP - septum forms ( Fig. 7A - C).	"Alk5	45	49	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutants	50	57	Sequence"	"cells	145	150	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Alk5"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutants"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Thus, we compared apoptosis patterns also on the more proximal level, but found no detectable differences at E11. 0 between Alk5 / Wnt1 - Cre mutants and controls ( Fig. 7D, E).	"Alk5	124	128	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Wnt1	131	135	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutants	142	149	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Alk5"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Wnt1"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutants"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
To conclude, our results suggest that in Alk5 / Wnt1 - Cre mutants a noticeable increase in apoptosis coincides with the abnormal patterning of the PAAs and the aortic sac, and with the failed AP - septation.	"Alk5	41	45	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Wnt1	48	52	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutants	59	66	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Alk5"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Wnt1"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutants"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Pharyngeal organs fail to migrate in Alk5 / Wnt1 - Cre mutants	"Alk5	37	41	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Wnt1	44	48	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutants	55	62	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Alk5"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Wnt1"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutants"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
In addition to the cardiac OFT, development of pharyngeal organs, i. e., the parathyroid glands and the thymus was also abnormal in Alk5 / Wnt1 - Cre mutants ( see Figs. 1 and 8).	"Alk5	132	136	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Wnt1	139	143	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutants	150	157	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Alk5"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Wnt1"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutants"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
The fate determination assay demonstrated that the thymic primordia were equally populated by NCCs both in controls and Alk5 mutants ( Fig. 8B, E).	"NCCs	94	98	Cell"	"Alk5	120	124	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutants	125	132	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""NCCs"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Alk5"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutants"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Likewise the parathyroid glands failed to migrate normally in Alk5 / Wnt1 - Cre mutants.	"Alk5	62	66	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Wnt1	69	73	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutants	80	87	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Alk5"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Wnt1"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutants"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
To conclude, the observed pharyngeal organ phenotypes were also in striking contrast to those seen in Tgfbr2 / Wnt1 - Cre mutants [ 8, 9].	"Tgfbr2	102	108	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Wnt1	111	115	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutants	122	129	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Tgfbr2"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Wnt1"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutants"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Pharyngeal organs fail to migrate in Alk5 / Wnt1 - Cre mutants.

However, both controls and mutants expressed parathyroid hormone ( PTH) at comparable levels ( blue staining in C and F).

Using this approach, several studies have independently shown that the NC - specific deletion of the Tgfbr2 gene leads to a distinct set of calvarial, facial and cardiac defects [ 8, 9, 20, 29].

Moreover, the Alk5 / Wnt1 - Cre mutants display an abnormal patterning of the aortic sac and defective AP septation leading to PTA, reminiscent of type A2 ( = truncus artriosus with no main pulmonary artery segment present [ 30]).

Although relevant Gdfs 8, 9 11 and 15 are not expressed in the developing heart, nor do the mice deficient in these Gdfs display developmental cardiac defects, we cannot exclude the possibility that circulating GDFs, perhaps in concert with TGF - beta s may contribute to NCC survival during cardiac and pharyngeal morphogenesis.

Already at E10. 5, we could see intense apoptosis among the postmigratory NCCs in the mesenchyme surrounding the aortic sac at the site where the prospective AP septum forms, i. e., this cell death precedes the AP septal defect seen in mutants.

Several in vitro studies have suggested an indispensable role for TGF - beta - signaling in differentiation of NCCs into smooth muscle cells.

In Alk5 mutants there is very little, if any, detectable septal mesenchyme present, and thus it could be argued that in these mutants OFT rotation fails due to a lack of penetration of septal prongs into the cushion mesenchyme.

Contrary to earlier suggestions, our results indicate that BMPs neither act as secondary signals downstream of Sonic Hedghog ( SHH) in patterning the anteroposterior axis nor as signals from the interdigital mesenchyme in specifying digit identity.

We do find that a threshold level of BMP signaling is required for the onset of chondrogenesis, and hence some chondrogenic condensations fail to form in limbs deficient in both BMP2 and BMP4.	"BMP	37	40	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP2	178	182	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	187	191	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 178, ""end_span"": 182, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 187, ""end_span"": 191, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
A group of related signaling molecules called bone morphogenetic proteins ( BMPs) are known to play important roles in the formation of the structures such as the limbs.	"molecules	29	38	Chemical"	"bone morphogenetic proteins	46	73	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMPs	76	80	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""molecules"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""bone morphogenetic proteins"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMPs"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We do find, however, that a minimal amount of BMP signal is required to form cartilage, and hence some cartilaginous elements fail to form in limbs deficient in both BMP2 and BMP4.	"BMP	46	49	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP2	166	170	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	175	179	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 166, ""end_span"": 170, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 179, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
BMP2 and BMP7 are thus secondary signals produced in response to SHH activity.	"BMP2	0	4	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP7	9	13	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"SHH	65	68	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP7"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""SHH"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
It remains unclear, however, whether BMP2 and BMP7 activity is required endogenously for anterior - posterior limb patterning by SHH.

A targeted deletion of Bmp7 has been made, and Bmp7 - deficient embryos display hindlimb polydactyly with incomplete penetrance but otherwise phenotypically normal limbs [ 12, 13].

Like BMP7, it is expressed in both the anterior and posterior margins of the limb bud mesenchyme [ 4, 14]; however, it does not appear to be induced by SHH signaling, nor does its expression change in SHH - deficient limb buds.	"BMP7	5	9	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"SHH	152	155	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"SHH	201	204	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP7"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""SHH"", ""start_span"": 152, ""end_span"": 155, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""SHH"", ""start_span"": 201, ""end_span"": 204, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
A third aspect of limb patterning in which BMP2, BMP4, and BMP7 have been implicated is in the apoptotic death of the interdigital tissue.	"BMP2	43	47	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	49	53	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP7	59	63	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP7"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
BMP activity also plays an indirect role in limb patterning as a key component of a feedback loop between SHH production in the posterior limb bud and fibroblast growth factor production in the overlying apical ectodermal ridge ( AER).

Likewise, conditional knockout of BmpR1A and BmpR1B blocks all chondrogenic differentiation in the mouse limb bud [ 26].

The Bmp2 / Bmp4 double mutants did display a loss of posterior digits with a broad posterior hand plate, suggestive of a block in the chondrogenic condensation of the posterior digit rays, rather than a change in anterior - posterior digit identity.

Bmp2 and Bmp4 are also expressed in the AER, where Prx1:: cre is inactive, and these domains of expression are not affected ( Figure 1A - 1D, black arrows).

Moreover, in the Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre animals, the AER is maintained as late as E15. 5, long after it has started to degrade in wild - type limbs.

The Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre mutant limbs at E15. 5 show strong acridine orange staining in the remnants of AER ( Figure 2H, asterisk), in domains of the distal tip where the AER remains the longest ( compare staining in Figure 2F and 2J).

No significant difference was observed in the extent of apoptosis in the cells of the AER in earlier stage Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre mutant embryonic limbs ( Figure S1D - S1G).

SHH signaling itself extends over a long range in the developing limb bud, based on both activation of target genes [ 36] and protein distribution [ 37].	"SHH	0	3	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"genes	110	115	Sequence"	"protein	126	133	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""SHH"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Nonetheless, some models have suggested that the patterning effect of this morphogenic signal is mediated entirely [ 10] or in part [ 11] by BMP2 and BMP7 produced as secondary signals in response to SHH.	"BMP2	141	145	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP7	150	154	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"SHH	200	203	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP7"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""SHH"", ""start_span"": 200, ""end_span"": 203, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We have removed both BMP2 and BMP7 activities in the early limb bud ( Figure 1), and moreover, there is no apparent upregulation of BMP4 expression in the posterior of these limbs ( Figure 3A - 3D).	"BMP2	21	25	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP7	30	34	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	132	136	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP7"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
While a distal phalanx is missing in the middle digits of the double mutants ( Bmp2C / C, Bmp7 - / -; Prx1:: cre), this is not a phenotype consistent with a decrease or loss of a posteriorly derived polarizing activity.	"mutants	69	76	Sequence"	"Bmp7	90	94	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Prx1	102	106	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""mutants"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Bmp7"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Prx1"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
These data strongly indicate that BMP2 and BMP7 are not required secondary signals for SHH - mediated polarization of the digits along the anterior - posterior axis.	"BMP2	34	38	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP7	43	47	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"SHH	87	90	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP7"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""SHH"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The lack of transformations in digit identity in the limb skeletons formed in the absence of BMP2 and BMP7 activity also argues against BMP signaling being the critical instructive signal from the interdigital mesenchyme to the forming digits.	"BMP2	93	97	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP7	102	106	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP	136	139	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP7"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In contrast to the proposed roles for BMPs in anterior - posterior digit patterning, we obtained further support for the well - accepted idea that a threshold level of BMP signaling is necessary interdigitally for programmed cell death to occur.	"BMPs	38	42	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP	168	171	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cell	225	229	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""BMPs"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 168, ""end_span"": 171, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 225, ""end_span"": 229, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We observed syndactyly with variable penetrance in limbs developing without BMP2 activity ( Figure 2B), and nearly complete soft tissue syndactyly of all digits in limbs deficient in both BMP2 and BMP4 ( compare Figure 2C and Figure 2D).	"BMP2	76	80	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP2	188	192	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	197	201	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 188, ""end_span"": 192, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 197, ""end_span"": 201, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Expression of several Fgf genes [ 20, 21] and maintenance of the AER itself [ 23] normally depend on BMP antagonism induced by SHH.	"genes	26	31	Sequence"	"BMP	101	104	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"SHH	127	130	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""SHH"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
While this explains the broader hand plate of the BMP2, BMP4 - deficient limb buds, it is somewhat paradoxical in terms of the skeletal phenotype, as a broadened autopod would normally be expected to result in the formation of extra digits ( polydactyly) ( e. g., Figure 1G and 1O of this paper and [ 16]), not the loss of digits, as observed in the double mutant forelimbs.	"BMP2	50	54	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	56	60	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutant	357	363	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 357, ""end_span"": 363, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
This expression of Msx2 in the posterior of the BMP2, BMP4 - deficient forelimbs reflects a failure of chondrogenesis in this region.	"Msx2	19	23	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP2	48	52	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	54	58	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Msx2"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Accordingly, skeletal preparations from each of the various mutant alleles were subjected to histological and molecular analyses.

As noted above, at E12. 5, chondrogenic condensation of the digits could be visualized in Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre limb buds by in situ hybridization with a Sox9 probe.	"Prx1	112	116	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Sox9	165	169	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"probe	170	175	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Prx1"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Sox9"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 169, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""probe"", ""start_span"": 170, ""end_span"": 175, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Similar analysis at E10. 5 and E11. 5 demonstrated a relatively normal process of condensation of the proximal skeletal elements ( Figure S1H - S1M), despite the absence of detectable Bmp2 and Bmp4 transcripts.

We examined whether the osteogenesis program is initiated in the BMP2, BMP4 - deficient limbs using several histological and molecular criteria, as described below ( Figure 5).	"BMP2	65	69	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	71	75	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"molecular	125	134	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""molecular"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Adjacent to the hypertrophic cells, a bone collar is laid down normally in the absence of BMP2 and BMP4 ( Figure 5A and 5B, red star).	"cells	29	34	Cell"	"BMP2	90	94	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	99	103	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In fact, bone marrow formation and trabecular bone formation have not yet started at birth in the absence of BMP2 and BMP4 ( Figure 5J), and the morphology of Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre bones at birth is most similar to control embryos at E17. 5 ( Figure 5E).	"BMP2	109	113	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	118	122	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Prx1	181	185	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Prx1"", ""start_span"": 181, ""end_span"": 185, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The inability to complete osteoblast differentiation in the Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre mice results in strikingly defective limb morphology at 1 wk of age ( compare Figure S3G and S3H).	"osteoblast	26	36	Cell"	"Prx1	82	86	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	93	97	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""osteoblast"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Prx1"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In particular, BMP2, a secreted factor that is induced by SHH [ 8] in the posterior limb bud, has been suggested to act as a true morphogen secondary to SHH signaling to properly pattern the limb digits.	"BMP2	15	19	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"SHH	58	61	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"SHH	153	156	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""SHH"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""SHH"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
It should be noted that the interdigital expression domains form several days after recombination of the floxed BMP alleles is complete.	"floxed	105	111	Sequence"	"BMP	112	115	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"alleles	116	123	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""floxed"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""alleles"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Moreover, there is no detectable compensatory upregulation of BMP7 in the interdigital mesenchyme of the BMP2, BMP4 - deficient limbs ( compare Figure 4G and Figure 4H).	"BMP7	62	66	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP2	105	109	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	111	115	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP7"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, in the Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre forelimbs, there is a complete loss of posterior digit ray condensations, presumably because the total level of BMP signaling falls below the threshold for initiation of condensation, as previously seen in cases where BMP antagonists have been used [ 27, 28].	"Prx1	38	42	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP	161	164	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP	267	270	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Prx1"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 161, ""end_span"": 164, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 267, ""end_span"": 270, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This is most likely explained by compensation in the distal limb bud by BMP2, BMP4, and BMP7 produced in the AER.	"BMP2	72	76	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	78	82	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP7	88	92	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP7"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The size of the skeletal elements in Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre limbs are also decreased compared to those of control mice, although not to the extent seen in the double receptor mutant.	"Prx1	59	63	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	124	128	Organism"	"mutant	185	191	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Prx1"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 185, ""end_span"": 191, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
This suggests that varying levels of expression from different BMP genes during preaxial and postaxial development result in fluctuations in total levels of BMP signaling, which at distinct times are above or below the threshold for supporting osteogenesis.	"BMP	63	66	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"genes	67	72	Sequence"	"BMP	157	160	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 160, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
BMPs have also been shown to activate MAPK and AKT pathways and, based on current published information, each of the osteogenic BMPs appears to have the same capacity to activate these signaling pathways [ 52 - 54].

This suggests, on the one hand, that small - effect QTL are difficult to identify with traditional strategies and, on the other hand, that the polymorphisms regulating gene expression might only slightly affect the quantitative traits, and thus are more difficult to identify.

Furthermore, there was no detected synergism in the phenotype of the double Pygo1 / Pygo2 mutant, although in several tissues the BAT - gal Wnt reporter did show more a severe reduction in expression.

The Pygopus deletion alleles described in this report, however, are almost certainly functional nulls.

The results in this report indicate a striking and surprising evolutionary divergence of Pygopus function between Drosophila and mammals.

In addition, the kidneys were not unique in showing surprisingly normal development in Pygo1 / Pygo2 mutants.

These results suggest that the proteins encoded by mammalian Pygopus genes are often mere modulators of canonical Wnt signaling intensity, and not essential components.

Perhaps the simplest explanation is that in mammals, other genes show partial functional redundancy with the two Pygopus genes.

Consistent with this idea, genetic analysis of a number of meiotic regulatory genes in the mouse has demonstrated a much stronger requirement in males than in females [ 1, 4].

One is the need for mechanisms to balance expression of sex - linked genes between the sexes, which in mammals is accomplished by X chromosome inactivation in females [ 5, 6].

Another key event of pachynema in male mammals is the packaging of the sex chromosomes into the XY body and the establishment of MSCI.

In conjunction with the immunohistochemical data, these data provide strong evidence that meiotic arrest in Trip13 mutant mice is due to defects in DSB repair.

Thus, mutational analysis of mouse Pch2 ( Trip13), which is also critical for the synapsis checkpoint in C. elegans [ 2], was the best remaining option to evaluate potential functional conservation in mammalian meiotic checkpoint control.

These potential recombination roles might not be limited to meiosis, since Trip13 is widely transcribed and the mutant animals exhibited developmental defects.

Regarding the cause of cell death in Trip13 mutants, our data indicate that this is triggered by defective DSB repair rather than asynapsis.

Furthermore, our results allow us to conclude that oocytes and spermatocytes share a similar, if not identical, DNA damage pachytene checkpoint that is decoupled from a synapsis checkpoint.
