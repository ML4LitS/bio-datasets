Third, we found evidence for an age - related increase in body fat in PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice ( females earlier than males), whereas Lin et al. identified a male - specific resistance to diet - induced obesity and insulin resistance.

Fourth, the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice described here exhibit a dramatic fasting - induced hepatic steatotic phenotype, whereas the Lin et al. mouse does not.

Our results also suggest a broader role for inducible transcriptional coactivators such as PGC - 1 alpha in transducing cellular signals triggered by physiologic and developmental cues to the transcriptional control of energy metabolism and other dynamic cellular processes.

While this explains the broader hand plate of the BMP2, BMP4 - deficient limb buds, it is somewhat paradoxical in terms of the skeletal phenotype, as a broadened autopod would normally be expected to result in the formation of extra digits ( polydactyly) ( e. g., Figure 1G and 1O of this paper and [ 16]), not the loss of digits, as observed in the double mutant forelimbs.

In particular, BMP2, a secreted factor that is induced by SHH [ 8] in the posterior limb bud, has been suggested to act as a true morphogen secondary to SHH signaling to properly pattern the limb digits.

However, in the Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre forelimbs, there is a complete loss of posterior digit ray condensations, presumably because the total level of BMP signaling falls below the threshold for initiation of condensation, as previously seen in cases where BMP antagonists have been used [ 27, 28].

This suggests that varying levels of expression from different BMP genes during preaxial and postaxial development result in fluctuations in total levels of BMP signaling, which at distinct times are above or below the threshold for supporting osteogenesis.

Furthermore, the region on Chromosome 7 associated with the development of lupus nephritis has been linked to the same trait in other murine models of SLE ( Santiago et al. 1998; Morel et al. 1999; Xie et al. 2002), suggesting the possibility of shared susceptibility loci.	region on Chromosome,17,37,Sequence	murine,134,140,Organism	loci,268,272,Sequence	"[{""token"": ""region on Chromosome"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""murine"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""loci"", ""start_span"": 268, ""end_span"": 272, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"	test

A possible explanation for this discrepancy may lie in the fact that the Apcs - / - mice analysed in the original study were generated from a limited number of founders and that this may have caused a nonrandom inheritance of the loci from the parental strains.
