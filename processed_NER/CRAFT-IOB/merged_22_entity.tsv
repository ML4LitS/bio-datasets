This transgene contains the tetracycline responsive hCMV * - 1 promoter [ consisting of the tetracycline responsive element ( TRE) and a minimal hCMV promoter] [ 25] from pTRE2 ( Clontech Inc., Mt. View, CA), a chimeric intron from pCI ( Promega) to increase message stability and expression [ 26, 27], a Kozak consensus sequence at the initiation codon to optimize translation [ 28], the human E2 cDNA which has been modified to contain a 4 x alanine linker followed by a c - myc epitope tag at the carboxy terminus to facilitate detection, and an SV40 late polyadenylation sequence from pCI for enhanced mRNA stability and translation.	transgene,5,14,Sequence	tetracycline,28,40,Chemical	hCMV,52,56,Organism	promoter,63,71,Sequence	tetracycline,92,104,Chemical	element,116,123,Sequence	hCMV,145,149,Organism	promoter,150,158,Sequence	intron,220,226,Sequence	message,259,266,Sequence	consensus sequence,311,329,Sequence	initiation codon,337,353,Sequence	human E2,389,397,Gene_or_geneproduct	cDNA,398,402,Sequence	modified,418,426,Sequence	alanine,444,451,Chemical	c - myc,473,480,Gene_or_geneproduct	epitope,481,488,Sequence	carboxy terminus,500,516,Sequence	SV40,549,553,Organism	polyadenylation sequence,559,583,Sequence	mRNA,606,610,Chemical	"[{""token"": ""transgene"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""tetracycline"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""hCMV"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""promoter"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""tetracycline"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""element"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""hCMV"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""promoter"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""intron"", ""start_span"": 220, ""end_span"": 226, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""message"", ""start_span"": 259, ""end_span"": 266, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""consensus sequence"", ""start_span"": 311, ""end_span"": 329, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""initiation codon"", ""start_span"": 337, ""end_span"": 353, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""human E2"", ""start_span"": 389, ""end_span"": 397, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cDNA"", ""start_span"": 398, ""end_span"": 402, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""modified"", ""start_span"": 418, ""end_span"": 426, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""alanine"", ""start_span"": 444, ""end_span"": 451, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""c - myc"", ""start_span"": 473, ""end_span"": 480, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""epitope"", ""start_span"": 481, ""end_span"": 488, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""carboxy terminus"", ""start_span"": 500, ""end_span"": 516, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""SV40"", ""start_span"": 549, ""end_span"": 553, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""polyadenylation sequence"", ""start_span"": 559, ""end_span"": 583, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""mRNA"", ""start_span"": 606, ""end_span"": 610, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"	valid
