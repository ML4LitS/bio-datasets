Thus, Ptdsr might play an important role in early events of ocular morphogenesis, such as establishment and bisection of eye fields and formation of optic cups.	"Ptdsr	6	11	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This study demonstrated that there is an initial phase of cell death during the invagination of the optic cup ( E10. 5), followed by subsequent waves of apoptosis induction immediately before and after birth ( E18. 5 to postnatal day P2), and from postnatal days P9 to P10 and P14 to P16 [ 42].

Their findings must be interpreted with caution because remodeling of cellular structures by apoptosis in specific retina layers is known to occur mainly postnatally [ 42], and apoptosis plays an important physiological role in the maintenance and homeostasis of lung epithelium after birth or in pathological conditions involving pulmonary inflammation and not during lung development [ 46].

Joint formation begins during embryogenesis, when stripes of high cell density called interzones form across developing skeletal precursors ( Haines 1947).	"cell	66	70	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
However, cells within the high - density layers of the interzone are excluded from this process and develop into the permanent layers of articular cartilage found in the mature joint ( Mitrovic 1978).	"cells	9	14	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Wnt14 is expressed in stripes at the sites where joints will form, and it is capable of inducing expression of other joint markers when misexpressed at new locations in the limb ( Hartmann and Tabin 2001).

Importantly, BMP signaling components are present in adult articular cartilage, suggesting that they may function during the late development or maintenance of this critical structure ( Erlacher et al. 1998; Chubinskaya et al. 2000; Muehleman et al. 2002; Bau et al. 2002; Bobacz et al. 2003).

Interestingly, Bmpr1a is also required for postnatal maintenance of articular cartilage throughout most of the skeleton.	"Bmpr1a	15	21	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Bmpr1a"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The progeny from all three lines showed strong LACZ expression primarily in joints, and in two of three lines HPLAP expression could also be seen in joint regions.

Sections through developing joints show that LACZ is present in many cells at the interzone stage ( unpublished data).	"cells	69	74	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
However, expression of LACZ in nearly 100% of joint cells is not achieved until the three - layer interzone stage ( for example, in the knee joint at E14. 5 or in any of the phalangeal joints at E16. 5 ( unpublished data).	"cells	52	57	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
These patterns are consistent with the well - established expression of Gdf5 in interzone regions during embryonic development ( Storm and Kingsley 1996).	"Gdf5	72	76	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Gdf5"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

This suggests that in a fraction of animals, sporadic expression of Cre at some time early in development is sufficient to lead to both ectopic recombination and LACZ expression.	"animals	36	43	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
For example, the second distal tarsal was fused to the central tarsal bone in every conditional knockout animal examined ( 18 of 18), a phenotype not observed in controls ( zero of 18) ( Figure 3B and 3C).

Previous studies suggest that parathyroid hormone - related protein, a diffusible signal made in the articular surface, may normally inhibit maturation of underlying cartilage ( Vortkamp et al. 1996; Weir et al. 1996).

Further work will be needed to determine whether synovial development is regulated by BMP signaling, or whether the synovium becomes enlarged as a response to nearby skeletal malformations ( such as fusion of the second and central tarsals or defects in the articular cartilage).

We found that dT - tailed 3 ' - extension was displaced efficiently by Mcm 4 / 6 / 7 while almost no or very little activity was detected on other substrates ( Figure 5B and C).

The addition of the 5 ' - tail to dT - tailed 3 ' - extension further stimulated the displacement ( Figure 5D), confirming the previous report that the fork structures facilitate the helicase action.

Only weak helicase activity was observed on the substrate carrying the 3 ' - tail of 25 repeats of TA dinucleotide ( 37 - TA25; Figure 6A), whereas strong helicase activity was observed on 37 - TTA17.

It should be noted that the TA25 tail would self - anneal and this would prevent the loading of Mcm, since the 3 ' - tail containing TTAA13 or TTTAAA8 did not enhance the unwinding either ( data not shown).

Thus, correlated differences in behavior and levels of GluR - B expression allowed a mechanistic and spatial dissection of olfactory learning, discrimination, and memory capabilities.

The sense of smell is of paramount importance for rodents [ 1], for which rapid odor discrimination and long - lasting olfactory memory permits responses to predator and prey critical for survival.

While in the formation and storage of olfactory memory piriform cortex [ 5 - 7], hippocampus [ 8, 9], and olfactory bulb [ 10 - 12] are all implicated, the cellular correlates for these processes have not been clearly delineated.

Concerning odor discrimination itself, cellular mechanisms for this process are often attributed to the inhibitory circuitry of the olfactory bulb ( [ 24 - 30]; reviewed in [ 31 - 33]).	"cellular	39	47	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cellular"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
These efforts allowed us to dissect, both spatially and mechanistically, the role of GluR - B - mediated AMPAR properties in selected brain regions in odor learning, discrimination, and memory.

We trained six GluR - B Delta ECS: FB mice and six littermate controls on one odor pair in an automated go / no - go olfactory conditioning task [ 3, 61].	"mice	38	42	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
"Both GluR - B Delta ECS: FB and control mice acquired the "" simple "" task to discriminate between the monomolecular odors amylacetate and ethylbutyrate ( percentage correct > 70% after 400 trials)."	"mice	40	44	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Strikingly, GluR - B Delta ECS: FB mice showed more rapid learning and enhanced discrimination capabilities ( Figure 1C, group effect: F ( 1, 10) = 10. 2, p < 0. 01).	"mice	35	39	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
For rewarded trials ( Figure 1D, green), already weakly trained animals kept their head in the sampling port ( large tube in Figure 1B) during the entire 2 - s trial, whereas for unrewarded trials the head is retracted quickly ( Figure 1D, red).	"animals	64	71	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
"The difference of these two curves ( Figure 1E, black) is a very sensitive assay for discrimination performance; the fitted maximum of this curve ( Figure 1E, blue) is referred to as the "" discrimination index "" in the remainder of the paper and is again strongly improved for GluR - B Delta ECS: FB mice, compared with controls ( Figure 1F; group effect: F ( 1, 10) = 11. 7, p < 0. 01)."	"mice	300	304	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 300, ""end_span"": 304, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Thus, expression of Ca2 + - permeable AMPARs in forebrain areas, including the olfactory bulb, resulted in more rapid odor learning and enhanced olfactory discrimination.	"Ca2 +	20	25	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Ca2 +"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"

Similar to GluR - B Delta ECS: FB, GluR - B Delta FB mice also showed enhanced learning and discrimination compared with controls ( Figure 2B; group effect: F ( 1, 16) = 6. 55; p < 0. 05).	"mice	53	57	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

In accordance with the proposed region - dependence, we expected that additional GluR - B subunits in hippocampus and / or piriform cortex improve odor memory but do not alter odor discrimination performance.

Importantly, both the spatial pattern and intensity of GFPGluR - B expression were constant among all GluR - BRescue mice analyzed ( n = 11).	"mice	117	121	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Olfactory memory experiments with GluR - BRescue, and both GluR - B Delta FB and GluR - B2lox mice as controls, were performed as described above ( indicated with shaded symbols in Figure 6A).

Memory was again highly reproducible in both GluR - B Delta FB ( 66 +/- 12%; n = 4) and GluR - B2lox ( 94 +/- 2%; n = 3) mice, compared with experiments performed earlier ( Figures 2E and 4A).	"mice	121	125	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This confirms the role of these brain areas as inferred from the mosaic expression and protein correlation analysis described above ( Figure 4).	"protein	87	94	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"

Furthermore, increased performance even after long stretches of training and, in particular, increased sampling pattern differences ( TB and ATS, unpublished data) supported the notion that GluR - B depletion resulted in enhanced odor discrimination capability.	"GluR - B	190	198	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 190, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Putative Cellular Basis of Enhanced Odor Discrimination and Learning	"Cellular	9	17	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Cellular"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
AMPAR properties were altered specifically in neurons of forebrain areas, most notably olfactory bulb, olfactory cortex, and other cortical areas and hippocampus, leading to enhanced odor discrimination and learning.	"neurons	46	53	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Yet, both mouse models yield enhanced discrimination and learning capability.	"mouse	10	15	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Notably, the improved olfactory discrimination capabilities were apparent even upon relatively small reductions in GluR - B levels.	"GluR - B	115	123	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
A direct test of this link would require the quantitative measurement of inhibition in the intact preparation, a task that might be feasible with further improved in vivo electrophysiological techniques, such as targeted recordings [ 70, 71] or simultaneous pre - and postsynaptic intracellular measurements.

Prolonged behavioral tasks such as the assessment of long - term olfactory memory were not performed with the seizure - prone GluR - B Delta ECS: FB mice.	"mice	149	153	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 149, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Memory in GluR - B Delta FB mice, however, was dramatically impaired.	"mice	28	32	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We therefore conclude that forebrain - specific ablation of GluR - B results in a specific loss of long - term olfactory memory but, at the same time, in enhanced odor discrimination and learning capabilities.

This is furthermore consistent with a prominent role of cortical areas or hippocampus in olfactory memory, although GluR - B levels in the olfactory bulb were also weakly correlated with memory performance.

Rb is also required for SAC differentiation, and in this case, acts by inhibiting E2f3a.	"Rb	0	2	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 2, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

Rb distribution matches that of E2f3a, consistent with its critical role in supporting SAC differentiation through E2f3a.	"Rb	0	2	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 2, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Nevertheless, it is clear that many aspects of differentiation in multiple cell types are compatible with ectopic division.	"cell	75	79	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
However, division of terminally differentiating cells is dangerous, since it may facilitate transformation, as is the case in retinoblastoma ( reviewed in [ 66]).	"cells	48	53	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
