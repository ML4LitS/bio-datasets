Next, we directly compared the nucleotide and amino acid sequence of the alternatively spliced mouse transcript to the entire human MCOLN1 genomic sequence and found no significant similarity.

However, our results suggest that phenotypic assessment of Mcoln1 knock - out mice may be complicated and that care must be taken when interpreting data on mouse gene expression and phenotype.

To determine the mechanisms that control regional differences in pigmentation, we have studied how a classical mouse mutation, droopy ear ( deH), affects dorsoventral skin characteristics, especially those under control of the Agouti gene.

Mice carrying the Agouti allele black - and - tan ( at) normally have a sharp boundary between dorsal black hair and yellow ventral hair; the deH mutation raises the pigmentation boundary, producing an apparent dorsal - to - ventral transformation.

Animals carrying the at allele express only the ventral - specific Agouti transcript ( Bultman et al. 1994; Vrieling et al. 1994) and have black dorsal hairs and cream - colored to yellow ventral hairs, with a sharp boundary at the level of the limb - body wall articulations and in the middle of the whisker pad.

The boundary between dorsal and ventral color compartments in at / at mice bears superficial resemblance to dorsoventral boundaries apparent for many other mammals, but morphogenetic differences between dorsal and ventral skin seem likely to include more elements than the type of pigment made by hair follicle melanocytes.

We also make use of a classical mouse mutation, droopy ear ( Curry 1959), that produces a dorsal - to - ventral transformation of flank coat color by allowing expansion of the ventral - specific Agouti transcript.	"mouse	32	37	Organism"	"mutation	38	46	Sequence"	"Agouti	195	201	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"transcript	202	212	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mutation"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Agouti"", ""start_span"": 195, ""end_span"": 201, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""transcript"", ""start_span"": 202, ""end_span"": 212, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Thus, at least three characteristics distinguish dorsal from ventral skin: differences in pigment - type synthesis ( depending on Agouti genotype), differences in hair length, and differences in melanin content.

Named after its effects on craniofacial morphology, droopy ear is a recessive mutation on mouse Chromosome 3; the original allele described more than 40 years ago by Curry ( 1959) is extinct, but a spontaneous remutation that occurred in Harwell, deH, is available through The Jackson Laboratory ( Bar Harbor, Maine, United States).

"We became interested in droopy ear because the original allele was described to affect pigment pattern in a way that suggests a possible dorsal to ventral transformation: "" On a genetic background ( at and AW) which causes the belly hair to be lighter than the back hair, the belly hair comes up farther round the sides of the body and face "" ( Curry 1959)."

Total body size is smaller in mutant compared to nonmutant animals, but the proportion of body circumference occupied by the lateral region in mutant animals is increased about 2 - fold, from 11. 9% to 22. 2% ( Figure 2C).

Although the effects of Agouti on pigment - type switching occur during postnatal hair growth, the ventral - specific isoform of Agouti is expressed in developing skin beginning at E11. 5.

The observations described above are consistent with a model in which transient expression of Tbx15 in the embryonic dorsal flank is required to establish positional identity of the future dermis, at least with respect to pigment - type synthesis caused by the ventral - specific Agouti isoform.

Several mutations and genes have been identified that affect the pattern of hair follicle development, but Tbx15 is the only gene of which we are aware that affects the pattern of hair pigmentation in different body regions.

Ventral areas that normally produce yellow hair in the trunk, limbs, and craniofacial regions are expanded in deH / deH mice and, in the trunk at least, represent inappropriate dorsal expression of an Agouti mRNA isoform that is normally restricted to ventral skin.

Levels of Agouti mRNA remain high throughout the entire ventrum, but hair pigment content is reduced, giving rise to a cream - colored region in the ventrum that, depending on age and genetic backgrounds, may appear more or less distinct from the yellow flank stripe.

For example, mutations in Tbx22 cause the human syndrome X - linked cleft palate and ankyloglossia ( Braybrook et al. 2001).

Our attention to the role of Tbx15 in pigment patterning was motivated by the effects of Agouti in postnatal animals.

In embryonic mesenchyme, expression of Tbx15 and Agouti are complementary, and it is possible that Tbx15 acts directly to inhibit Agouti transcription in dorsolateral mesenchyme.	"Tbx15	39	44	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Agouti	49	55	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Tbx15	99	104	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Agouti	130	136	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Tbx15"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Agouti"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Tbx15"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Agouti"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We speculate that a diffusible signal from dorsal trunk ectoderm, at or prior to E11. 5, promotes expression of Tbx15 in dorsal trunk mesenchyme, which then establishes dorsal positional identity of those cells as manifested by differences in Agouti expression, pigment - cell development, and hair growth.

Currently it is held that excitatory dopamine D1Rs mediate the acquisition and expression of several conditioned behaviors involving food reinforcers [ e. g.

While D2R antagonists have been used in the context of rodent associative learning paradigms, their lack of receptor subtype specificity [ 13] and motor - disrupting effects [ 6, 8] have prevented a rigorous examination of the actual role this dopamine receptor subtype plays in associative and reversal learning in the context of an operant behavior.

Nonetheless, the inability of D2R - / - mice to disengage from previously established S + / S - contingencies ( responding to a discriminative stimulus; Fig. 4) strongly argues that mesolimbic dopamine, and in particular dopamine D2R - mediated signaling, modulates the process of alerting the subject that familiar contingencies are now associated unexpected consequences.

Possibly, the lack of dopamine D2R - mediated signaling prevents refinement of the corticostriatal reinforcement circuits in the brains of the D2R - / - mice, thus impairing their ability to form S + / S - contingencies and disengage inappropriate dopamine D1R - mediated associative responding when unexpected consequences to goal - directed behaviors happened.

"genes	112	117	Sequence"	"gene	122	126	Sequence"	"gene	150	154	Sequence"	"organisms	173	182	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""gene"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""gene"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""organisms"", ""start_span"": 173, ""end_span"": 182, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
To date, only three active TACC genes have been cloned in humans [ 1 - 3], one in each of mouse [ 7], Xenopus laevis [ 8], D. melanogaster [ 4], and C. elegans [ 5, 6].

Thus, the identification and functional characterization of new members of the TACC family in other organisms, alternatively spliced isoforms of each TACC and comparison of the phylogenetic relationship of these genes relative to other members of the coiled coil superfamily will resolve this issue and provide clues to the evolution of TACC function.	"organisms	100	109	Organism"	"alternatively spliced isoforms	111	141	Sequence"	"genes	212	217	Sequence"	"coiled coil	251	262	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""organisms"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""alternatively spliced isoforms"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 212, ""end_span"": 217, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""coiled coil"", ""start_span"": 251, ""end_span"": 262, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
However, due to the relative infancy of the cDNA / genome projects for these latter organisms, complete characterization of these TACC genes could not be undertaken.	"cDNA	44	48	Sequence"	"genome	51	57	Sequence"	"organisms	84	93	Organism"	"genes	135	140	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""cDNA"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""genome"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""organisms"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
The TACC family defines a separate subfamily of coiled coil containing proteins, distinct from other coiled coil families such as the keratins, RHAMM and tropomyosins.

Note that the RHAMM proteins form a separate branch more closely related to the tropomyosins and kinesin like proteins ( KLP), than the TACC proteins.

However, the other two genes, trTACC1A and trTACC1B are clearly most related to TACC1 ( Fig. 1).

In addition, no expression of TACC1X was detected in mouse RNA by rt - PCR analysis ( data not shown), suggesting that this sequence is a processed pseudogene.

No pseudogenes corresponding to TACC2 or TACC3 were identified in any mammalian species.

Based upon current functional analysis, the characterization of TACC3 orthologues is likely to be pivotal to understanding the sequence and functional evolution of the TACC gene family.

However, Northern blot data suggested that this gene produces a single 2. 3 kb transcript [ 9], indicating that the cloned cDNA was incomplete.

We have previously noted that the N - terminal and C - terminal regions of the human and mouse TACC3 proteins are highly conserved ( [ 2], see below).

This suggests that the ancestral FGFR - TACC gene pair most probably arose prior to the initial duplication and subsequent divergence of these paralogous chromosomal segments, estimated to have occurred 687 +/- 155. 7 MYA.

Although not fully assembled, examination of the genome of T. rubripes confirmed the presence of chromosomal segments paralogous to those found in higher vertebrates ( Fig. 2).

Although no alternative splicing of TACC3 has been clearly documented, both temporal and tissue specific splicing is observed in the TACC1 and TACC2 genes.

rt - PCR analysis confirms splicing of the untranslated exon 1a to exon 1, with retention of the originally defined start methionine ( GB: NP _ 006274) ( Variant A *, lanes 1 and 3).

Thus, it seems likely that TACC family members in protostomes and deuterostomes have integrated new unique functions as the evolving TACC genes acquired additional exons.

Significantly, the ceTAC protein has also recently been implicated in DNA repair through its direct interaction with the C. elegans BARD1 orthologue [ 30].

However, the variability of the central domain of the vertebrate orthologues, suggests that TACC3 may also have acquired additional, and in some instances, species - specific functions.

This suggests that while protostome TACCs may require additional protein factors to interact with such components, the TACCs in higher organisms may have evolved the ability to directly interact with some of the proteins in the predicted interaction map ( Fig. 6E).

It has been shown that HGF is expressed along this anatomic pathway [ 23], and mice with absence of the HGF receptor c - Met fail to form muscularized pleuroperitoneal folds ( PPFs), and thus have amuscular diaphragms [ 24, 25].

In order to better understand the mechanistic basis of ESCS, we undertook a molecular and ultrastructural analysis of the photoreceptors of the rd7 mutant mouse.

In an initial analysis of the rd7 mutant, homozygous mutant retinas were compared with wild - type controls at multiple postnatal time points using both cDNA and Affymetrix microarrays.

In addition to these genes, several novel cone - specific genes of unknown function recently identified in our lab were also up - regulated ( Figure 1, genes G16, G17, G21, and G24; unpublished data).	"genes	21	26	Sequence"	"cone	42	46	Cell"	"genes	58	63	Sequence"	"genes	152	157	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 152, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
One exception to this statement is the gene RIKEN cDNA 4933409K07 ( Figure 1, gene G47), which was the only gene shown to be up - regulated at all timepoints examined.	"gene	39	43	Sequence"	"RIKEN cDNA 4933409K07	44	65	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"gene	78	82	Sequence"	"gene	108	112	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""gene"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""RIKEN cDNA 4933409K07"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""gene"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""gene"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
In order to confirm these microarray results, an in situ hybridization analysis of the putative up - regulated cone genes was carried out in which the rd7 mutant retina was compared with age - matched, wild - type controls.	"cone	111	115	Cell"	"genes	116	121	Sequence"	"mutant	155	161	Sequence"	"wild - type	202	213	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""wild - type"", ""start_span"": 202, ""end_span"": 213, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Of these, at least ten showed a definite cone - specific or cone - enriched pattern of expression in the wild - type retina ( Figure 1, genes G26 - G35).	"cone	41	45	Cell"	"cone	60	64	Cell"	"wild - type	105	116	Sequence"	"genes	136	141	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""wild - type"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Despite this apparent absence of cone staining, the pattern of derepression in rd7 suggests that these genes may also be novel cone - specific genes, albeit expressed at levels below the sensitivity threshold of our in situ hybridization assay.

A relatively frequent finding among both previously identified cone - specific genes, as well as in some of those identified in the present study, is the occurrence of gene expression in an early photoreceptor precursor pattern ( Figure 5).

Intriguingly, three genes shown to be up - regulated in rd7 on microarray, but that had either no detectable signal by in situ hybridization at adult stages or no apparent change in expression by in situ hybridization between wild type and rd7, also showed this early photoreceptor pattern ( Figure 1, genes G48 - G50).

One further finding to note is that the cell bodies of the M - opsin - positive cells appear to be scattered throughout the ONL in the rd7 mutant at P14 ( Figure S8).	"cell bodies	40	51	GO_ontology"	"M - opsin	59	68	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cells	80	85	Cell"	"mutant	139	145	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""cell bodies"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""M - opsin"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
In situ hybridization analysis of several rod - specific genes at P6 revealed that rhodopsin alone showed a markedly lower level of expression compared to wild type ( Figure 6; unpublished data).	"rod	42	45	Cell"	"genes	57	62	Sequence"	"rhodopsin	83	92	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"wild type	155	164	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""rhodopsin"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""wild type"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 164, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Although this deletion most likely creates a null allele, a residual transcript is clearly present and up - regulated in the rd7 mutant.

In the wild - type mouse, cone cell bodies are aligned along the scleral border of the ONL, and they are larger than those of rods.	"wild - type	7	18	Sequence"	"mouse	19	24	Organism"	"cell bodies	31	42	GO_ontology"	"rods	126	130	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""wild - type"", ""start_span"": 7, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""cell bodies"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""rods"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Lastly, they frequently have a patch of organelle - rich cytoplasm next to their nuclei, usually containing large mitochondria [ 26].	"organelle	40	49	GO_ontology"	"cytoplasm	57	66	GO_ontology"	"nuclei	81	87	GO_ontology"	"mitochondria	114	126	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""organelle"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""cytoplasm"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""nuclei"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""mitochondria"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Analysis of toluidine blue - stained semi - thin sections revealed that such cone - like cells were present in greater abundance in the rd7 retina than in wild - type, and that their somata were scattered throughout the ONL ( Figure 7).	"cone	77	81	Cell"	"cells	89	94	Cell"	"wild - type	155	166	Sequence"	"somata	183	189	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""wild - type"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 166, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""somata"", ""start_span"": 183, ""end_span"": 189, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Analysis of the nuclear morphology of dissociated retinal cells stained for S - cone opsin by dissociated cell in situ hybridization confirmed that this is the case ( unpublished data).	"nuclear	16	23	GO_ontology"	"cells	58	63	Cell"	"S - cone opsin	76	90	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cell	106	110	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""S - cone opsin"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In contrast to the cone cell body, the wild - type rod soma is small and nearly round.	"cell body	24	33	GO_ontology"	"wild - type	39	50	Sequence"	"rod	51	54	Cell"	"soma	55	59	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""cell body"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""wild - type"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""soma"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
First, the euchromatin is, on average, more abundant in these cells than in wild - type rods ( compare Figure 7G and 7H).	"euchromatin	11	22	GO_ontology"	"cells	62	67	Cell"	"wild - type	76	87	Sequence"	"rods	88	92	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""euchromatin"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""wild - type"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""rods"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In addition, comparison of the diagrammatic representation of the wild - type and rd7 ONLs suggests that the average area of the S - opsin - negative cells in rd7 is greater than in the wild - type ( Figure 7C and 7D).	"wild - type	66	77	Sequence"	"S - opsin	129	138	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cells	150	155	Cell"	"wild - type	186	197	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""wild - type"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""S - opsin"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 155, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""wild - type"", ""start_span"": 186, ""end_span"": 197, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
In order to confirm this impression, we quantitated the area of 50 wild - type and 50 mutant rod - like cell bodies ( see Materials and Methods for details).	"wild - type	67	78	Sequence"	"mutant	86	92	Sequence"	"rod	93	96	Cell"	"cell bodies	104	115	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""wild - type"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell bodies"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
It is also notable that the standard deviation of the somal area is nearly twice as great in rd7 than in wild - type, confirming the subjective impression of greater variability in somal size and shape in the mutant compared to the wild - type ( compare Figure 7C and 7D).	"somal	54	59	GO_ontology"	"wild - type	105	116	Sequence"	"mutant	209	215	Sequence"	"wild - type	232	243	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""somal"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""wild - type"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 209, ""end_span"": 215, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""wild - type"", ""start_span"": 232, ""end_span"": 243, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Lastly, 38% ( 19 / 50) of the rd7 photoreceptors selected for somal area quantitation had prominent juxtanuclear mitochondria ( red arrow in Figure 7H; unpublished data).	"photoreceptors	34	48	Cell"	"somal	62	67	GO_ontology"	"juxtanuclear	100	112	GO_ontology"	"mitochondria	113	125	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptors"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""somal"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""juxtanuclear"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""mitochondria"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
This pattern of staining suggests that these genes are more highly expressed in S - opsin expressing cells than in the hybrid cells of the rd7 retina.	"genes	45	50	Sequence"	"S - opsin	80	89	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cells	101	106	Cell"	"cells	126	131	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""S - opsin"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
It can be inferred from this fact that Nrl is absolutely required for the normal silencing of cone - specific genes in rods.	"Nrl	39	42	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cone	94	98	Cell"	"genes	110	115	Sequence"	"rods	119	123	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Nrl"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""rods"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In the Nrl homozygous mutant, there is a stronger and more uniform derepression of many cone - specific genes throughout the ONL than is seen in the rd7 retina ( unpublished data).	"Nrl	7	10	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutant	22	28	Sequence"	"cone	88	92	Cell"	"genes	104	109	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Nrl"", ""start_span"": 7, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
The second pattern of derepression seen in the rd7 retina ( type II), is represented by a scattered population of cells throughout the ONL that shows derepression of several cone - specific genes, including S - cone opsin.	"cells	114	119	Cell"	"cone	174	178	Cell"	"genes	190	195	Sequence"	"S - cone opsin	207	221	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 174, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 190, ""end_span"": 195, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""S - cone opsin"", ""start_span"": 207, ""end_span"": 221, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In addition to demonstrating derepression of a range of known cone - specific genes in rd7 mutants, Chen et al.	"known	56	61	Sequence"	"cone	62	66	Cell"	"genes	78	83	Sequence"	"mutants	91	98	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""known"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""mutants"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
[ 18] showed up - regulation by Northern blot of two additional genes in the rd7 mutant, Elovl2 and Fabp7.	"genes	64	69	Sequence"	"mutant	81	87	Sequence"	"Elovl2	89	95	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Fabp7	100	105	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Elovl2"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Fabp7"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
First, they identified a zebrafish homolog of Nr2e3 and showed it to be expressed in photoreceptors.

A fourth gene involved in glucose metabolism, glucokinase regulatory protein ( Gckr), was found to be increased in three out of three microarrays at P21 but was not tested by in situ hybridization ( Table S4).	"gene	9	13	Sequence"	"glucose	26	33	Chemical"	"glucokinase regulatory protein	46	76	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Gckr	79	83	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""gene"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""glucokinase regulatory protein"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Gckr"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The increased expression of Gckr in rd7 mutant retina suggests that it too may be a cone - enriched gene.	"Gckr	28	32	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutant	40	46	Sequence"	"cone	84	88	Cell"	"gene	100	104	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Gckr"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""gene"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
It is known that Nr2e3 is expressed only in rods, and the transcript is first detectable in postmitotic cells ( J. Trimarchi and CLC, unpublished data).	"Nr2e3	17	22	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"rods	44	48	Cell"	"transcript	58	68	Sequence"	"cells	104	109	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Nr2e3"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""rods"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""transcript"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
First, it is possible that there are two distinct types of rod precursor; loss of Nr2e3 in one leads to S - cone fate and in the other results in a hybrid cell type.

[ 5] have recently pointed out additional features shared by patients with CRB1 mutations and mutations in NR2E3, including hyperopic refractive errors and a distinctive pattern of clumped pigmentation in the retina.

This interpretation is consistent with previous studies which have revealed that the carboxy terminus of an analogous subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is essential for subunit interactions [ 35] and insertion of a Hisx6 tag on the carboxy terminus of an analogous E. coli subunit interfered with normal subunit assembly [ 36].

In the placenta, female mice normally inactivate the X chromosome that they inherit from their fathers ( Xp), so if females inherit from their mother an X chromosome ( Xm) that bears the abnormal copy of Atrx ( XmMUTXp), one would predict that, like affected males, they would fail to form a normal placenta.

Studies of X - chromosome inactivation in carrier females have demonstrated preferential inactivation of the chromosome bearing the abnormal allele in a variety of tissues [ 2], and this skewing of X - inactivation is thought to explain the mild phenotype observed in carriers.

Northern and Western blot analyses ( Figure 2D and 2E) confirmed that the Atrxflox clones continued to express both full - length Atrx protein and the truncated Atrxt isoform.

We investigated directly the effect of Atrx on ES cell growth by comparing Atrx + and Atrxnull ES cell clones in competition cultures.

Equal numbers of Atrx + ( bearing either an AtrxWT or an Atrxflox allele) and Atrxnull ( bearing an Atrx Delta 18 Delta neo allele) ES cells were inoculated into cultures and the mixed cultures were passaged ( 1: 3 split) every 2 d for 8 - 10 d.

The clone containing the Atrx Delta 18 Delta neo allele was rapidly outgrown by both AtrxWT ES cells and cells bearing the Atrxflox allele.

To investigate a possible cell - cycle defect in the absence of Atrx, we analysed the cell cycle distribution of bromodeoxyuridine ( BrdU) - pulsed ES cells by flow cytometry ( Figure S1A).	"cell	26	30	Cell"	"Atrx	64	68	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cell	86	90	Cell"	"cells	151	156	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Atrx"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 151, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Thus, the growth defect observed in ES cells lacking Atrx is not due to a specific cell cycle block or significant induction of cell death.

Intercrosses between males hemizygous ( Atrxflox / Y) and females heterozygous ( AtrxWT / flox) for the floxed allele were also carried out to generate homozygous females ( Atrxflox / flox).

Within the large nuclei of these TGCs, the typical nuclear association of Atrx with blocks of pericentromeric heterochromatin [ 15] was clearly observable.

A TGC deficiency in the absence of Atrx is consistent with the observation that Atrx is highly expressed in giant cells surrounding wild - type 7. 5 dpc embryos ( Figure 5E).

Thus, although random X - inactivation occurs normally within the epiblast, the AtrxWT allele ( inherited on the Xp chromosome) escaped the normal imprinted X - inactivation in the extraembryonic compartment of some carrier females.

By using a conditional knockout approach, we ablated the full - length Atrx protein first in ES cells and embryoid bodies, and then in developing mouse embryos.

Embryonic lethality in mice in the absence of Atrx was a surprising finding, as there had been no suggestion of foetal loss in the human ATR - X syndrome.

It is possible that the role of Atrx in the trophoblast is specific to mice and that ATRX has no role or is redundant in the human trophoblast.

An alternative explanation for the unexpectedly severe phenotype we observed in mice is that the Atrx Delta 18 Delta neo deletion generated by Cre recombination completely ablates full - length Atrx protein ( Figure 2E).

The secondary TGCs affected in the universal Atrx knockout reported here represent one of the first terminally differentiated tissues in the developing mouse, and this may point to the requirement for Atrx in the high - level expression of some tissue - specific genes during the final stages of differentiation.

Another surprising finding of this study is that, in carrier female embryos, a paternally inherited AtrxWT allele appears to escape the process of imprinted X - inactivation, which ordinarily silences the Xp chromosome in the extraembryonic compartment of female murine tissues [ 18].	"allele	107	113	Sequence"	"X	157	158	GO_ontology"	"chromosome	208	218	GO_ontology"	"murine	263	269	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""allele"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""X"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""chromosome"", ""start_span"": 208, ""end_span"": 218, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""murine"", ""start_span"": 263, ""end_span"": 269, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Silencing of the AtrxWT allele on Xp should render these females null for Atrx in the extraembryonic tissues, since the normally active Xm chromosome carries the Atrx Delta 18 Delta neo allele.	"allele	24	30	Sequence"	"Atrx	74	78	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"chromosome	139	149	GO_ontology"	"allele	186	192	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""allele"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Atrx"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""chromosome"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""allele"", ""start_span"": 186, ""end_span"": 192, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Thus, the failure to correctly silence the paternally derived AtrxWT allele in the extraembryonic tissues of carrier females is consistent with our observations that in Atrxnull males, the Atrx protein plays an essential role in the development of the trophoblast and is necessary for survival in utero in the mouse.

"Perhaps a more likely explanation for this phenomenon stems from experimental observations suggesting that imprinted X - inactivation is not imposed on all precursors of the mouse extraembryonic tissues: A subpopulation of cells may escape this process and make a random "" choice "" of which X chromosome will be inactivated."

Although initially small and quickly diluted in normal embryos, the cellular subpopulation that inactivates the Xm chromosome could rapidly expand to replace the normally imprinted cells in extraembryonic lineages if the normal silencing of Xp compromises cell growth or differentiation.

Interestingly, it has been suggested that the size of the population that initially escapes imprinting may range widely ( from 0% to 30%), even between genetically identical embryos [ 37], and this may account for the variable phenotype observed among females bearing Xm - linked mutant alleles of genes essential for normal extraembryonic development [ 38].

These mice were mated with a strain carrying Cre recombinase under the control of the human Keratin 14 ( K14) promoter, which is active in basal cells of epidermis and other stratified epithelia.

We report here that K14 promoter - driven loss of Apc resulted in aberrant development of several organs that require inductive epithelial - mesenchymal interactions, including hair follicle, teeth, and thymus, and resulted in neonatal death in mice.

Southern blot analysis of tail DNA from F1 offspring of both ApcCKON and Apc Delta 580 lines confirmed the germline transmission of modified Apc allele ( Figure 1B).

These results suggested that deletion of exon 14 indeed results in either loss or abnormal function of the Apc gene product.

Similar to the results reported with an independently generated Apc Delta 580 / + conditional mouse strain [ 14], Apc Delta 580 / + mice had more than 100 ( 120 +/- 37, n = 11) intestinal tumors at the time of their death ( Figure S1).

The mutant allele had to be maintained and transmitted through male mice, as Apc Delta 580 / + females were frequently not healthy enough to successfully nurse their own pups because of their tumor burden.

These mice as well as heterozygous mice for ApcCKO allele are normal, showing no differences in their survival to the wild - type littermates ( Figure 1C).

No differences between the normal and KA mutant mice in the mandibular bone can be detected, but the mutant mice lacked or had underdeveloped set of maxillary incisors and molars ( Figure 2H).

In the mutant skin, either BrdU incorporation or Ki67 expression was observed not only in cells in bulbs at the base of the hair follicle but also in bulb - like structures that were budding out from the ORS of the existing hair follicles ( Figure 4G and 4G ').

Cortical and medullary TEC subsets are characterized by differential expression of four keratin species: K8, K18, K5, and K14.

K1 staining was not detected in young mice at P3 but in older mice it was detected in differentiated keratinocytes in some of Hassall ' s corpuscles ( Figure S3).

Unlike in the normal or mild mutant thymi, the severe P3 mutant thymus showed extensive K14 expression that overlapped with K8 expression ( Figure 6K).	"mutant	29	35	Sequence"	"mutant	57	63	Sequence"	"K14	88	91	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"K8	124	126	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""K14"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""K8"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
At P10 - P13, the mutant thymus consisted of numerous enlarged Hassall ' s corpuscle - like structures, made of arrays of K14 - and K8 - expressing keratinizing epithelial cells surrounding large keratin deposits ( Figure 6L and 6O).	"mutant	18	24	Sequence"	"K14	122	125	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"K8	132	134	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"epithelial cells	161	177	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""K14"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""K8"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""epithelial cells"", ""start_span"": 161, ""end_span"": 177, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Varying degrees of differentiation - specific markers depending on the age of mice, in this case K1 and involucrin that are normally present only in Hassall ' s corpuscles, were also detected in mutant thymi ( Figure S3).

Collectively, these results suggest that loss of Apc and consequent stabilization of beta - catenin in K14 - expressing TECs lead to their aberrant proliferation and differentiation to keratinocytes, causing massive squamous metaplasia, rather than to form either medullary or cortical TECs.

The homozygous mice for the conditional allele are viable and indistinguishable to the normal mice, allowing us to study the roles of Apc in a tissue - and temporal - specific manner.

One of the most important considerations has to do with the integration site of the transgene in the mouse genome.

While some features of our mutant mice were similar to these transgenic mice, other phenotypic aspects were largely distinct.

This observation was similar to the ectopic tooth buds found in animals misexpressing Lef1 [ 27], but more severe and was also present at birth, indicating the effect of Apc loss during the initiation of embryonic tooth development, which was evident by aberrant Shh expression in E15. 5 embryonic oral epithelium ( unpublished data).

K14 - driven loss of Apc and subsequent constitutive expression of beta - catenin in TECs have therefore misdirected them to wrong epithelial cell fate, not allowing proper differentiation to either cortical or medullary TECs, which is essential for normal thymocyte development.
