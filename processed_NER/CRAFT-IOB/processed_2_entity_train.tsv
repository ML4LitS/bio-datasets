While Moynahan et al were careful to point out this problem, two sets of results argue against the possibility that the recombinational repair deficiency of CAPAN - 1 cells is completely independent of its defect in BRCA2.

Conversely, the BRCA2 defect in CAPAN - 1 could be fully responsible for the 100 - fold defect in recombination if the level of BRCA2 complementation observed by Powell was incomplete.

The final experiment reported by Davies et al [ 26] is particularly important with respect to understanding the mechanism ( s) through which BRCA2 promotes RAD51 - dependent recombination.

Finally, it is important to note that the two models for the function of the BRCA2 - RAD51 interaction shown in Figure 2 are not mutually exclusive.

Further experiments are clearly required to clarify the functional interactions between BRCA2 and RAD51 during recombinational repair.

However, several technical obstacles, including the large size of BRCA2, promise to make biochemical characterization of BRCA2 function difficult.

ECFP harbors six amino substitutions ( Y66W, F64L, S65T, N146I, M153T, V163A) as compared to GFP, whereas EYFP harbors four ( S65G, V68L, S72A and T203Y).

Cells expressing one or other of the two GFP variant reporters were clearly distinguishable within a mixed population ( Fig. 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d).

Interestingly however we were unable to recover clones expressing DsRed1 at the same frequency as for the GFP variant reporters after electroporation and selection under identical conditions.

Indeed the DsRed1 expressing clones that we were able to recover did not retain their characteristic ES cell morphology, usually appearing smaller and more spherical ( Fig. 1e and 1f), or occasionally spindle shaped ( data not shown).

Unlike the fluorescence produced by the GFP variants which was evenly distributed throughout the cells, the DsRed signal was never homogenous.

However, again we were unable to generate ES cells or mice exhibiting robust widespread reporter activity ( A. - K. H. and V. E. Papaioannou, unpublished observations).

This suggests that the DsRed1 RFP reporter was unable to recapitulate the expression profile of the promoter / enhancer combination employed.

From these observations we conclude that the blue - shifted ECFP, and the red - shifted EYFP variants of wtGFP are both amenable to use in mice.

Since the emission profiles of ECFP and EYFP are the least overlapping of all the usable GFP variants, these ECFP and EYFP currently represent the best combination for co - visualization and for use in multi - spectral double - tagged transgenic, chimeric and / or in vivo FRET experiments ( reviewed in [ 16]).

Thus, the size reduction in the vestibular sensory ganglion could be compatible with a loss of BDNF production in the immature hair cells.

Likewise, the innervation of the apex ( Fig. 2f) shows no detectable abnormality in overall pattern of innervation compared to control animals ( data not shown), an indication that BDNF could be expressed in the apex [ 6].

In addition, the pattern of efferent innervation shows no deviation from normal either ( Fig. 2e), whereas they show the same pattern of loss as afferent fibers in neurotrophin null mutants [ 16].

Comparison of numbers of immature hair cells in the vestibular and cochlear areas ( Fig. 4) with the numbers of surviving vestibular and cochlear sensory neurons does not show any correlation ( Table 1; Fig. 5).

Note the sharp reduction to 1% in the cochlear immature hair cells ( bottom) whereas spiral sensory neurons ( SG) are only reduced by 50% ( top).

In contrast, 20% immature hair cells could be identified in vestibular sensory epithelia ( saccule has been selected; bottom) whereas only around 15% of the vestibular sensory neurons survive to this age ( VG; top).

Very few fibers ( both afferent and efferent) to the vestibular epithelia remain ( Fig. 7a), thus displaying a further reduction of the pattern of innervation found in P8 Brn3c null mutants.

In the cochlea, the BDNF signal was very weak in the base in both the control ( Fig. 9b) and the Brn3c null littermates ( Fig. 9a).

However, there was a surprisingly strong NT - 3 signal over the organ of Corti in the apex of Brn3c null littermates ( Fig. 9c) that closely matched the signal found in the control littermates ( Fig. 9d).

The neurotrophins have long been implicated as the mediators for target mediated cell death.

In contrast, Brn3c is barely expressed during embryogenesis in the CNS [ 22] thus arguing that the survival of ear primary neurons depends crucially on the periphery.	"Brn3c	13	18	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"primary neurons	115	130	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Brn3c"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""primary neurons"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The situation in the utricle, saccule and cochlea is less clear as both BDNF and NT - 3 are expressed [ 6, 7].	"BDNF	72	76	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"NT - 3	81	87	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BDNF"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""NT - 3"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In fact, in the cochlea of embryos and neonates as well as in the saccule and utricle of embryos, NT - 3 is predominantly expressed in supporting cells [ 6].

Thus the factor ( s) cannot be released by differentiated hair cells but there is an unexplored possibility of generalized expression of neurotrophins at low levels in the undifferentiated epithelia.

Such expression in the CNS could possibly offset to some extent the peripheral loss of neutrophins in targeted null mutants.

The formation of supporting cells also appears to depend on the proper expression of various bHLH factors such as Hes 1 and 5 which appear to be regulated by the Notch signaling pathway [ 17, 28, 29].

Specifically, efferent fibers may suffer the same loss of their molecularly unknown neurotrophic support as do afferents and therefore show the same spatio - temporal profile of loss ( Fig. 3).

Our data show that at least a cochleotopic projection in the cochlear nerve and the cochlear nuclei develops even in Brn 3c null mutants ( Fig. 6).

Those data are also consistent with the formation of a crude cochleotopic projection in NT - 3 null mutants [ 6, 14].

Other factors, such as GDNF [ 11, 40] need to be investigated in their expression in these mutants and their functional role needs to be assessed, in particular in the cochlear apex.

Identification of the genetic defect ( s) in a rare human disorder, sitosterolemia, where these processes are specifically disrupted, may finally have led to the identification of the ' transporters ' responsible for these processes.

Despite this caveat, the findings of sitosterol in significant quantities in the bile suggests that mechanisms other than via the sterolins can ' export ' some of these sterols.	"sitosterol	37	47	Chemical"	"sterols	169	176	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""sitosterol"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""sterols"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
On the other hand, since feeding is intermittent, a slow, but continuous secretion during post - prandial periods could easily negate any mild temporary increase in tissue and plasma plant sterol levels in heterozygous animals.

Thus, there is support for at least four loci that may be involved in regulating plasma plant sterol levels.

Type I fibers are mitochondria - rich and mainly use oxidative metabolism for energy production, which provides a stable and long - lasting supply of ATP, and thus are fatigue - resistant.

Type IIb fibers have the lowest levels of mitochondrial content and oxidative enzymes, rely on glycolytic metabolism as a major energy source, and are susceptible to fatigue, while the oxidative and contraction functions of type IIa and IIx lie between type I and IIb ( Booth and Thomason 1991; Berchtold et al. 2000; Olson and Williams 2000).

We have previously established that peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor ( PPAR) delta is a major transcriptional regulator of fat burning in adipose tissue through activation of enzymes associated with long - chain fatty - acid beta - oxidation ( Wang et al. 2003).

Although PPAR delta is the predominant PPAR isoform present in skeletal muscle, its in vivo function has not been determined.

An examination of PPAR delta in different muscle fibers reveals a significantly higher level in type I muscle ( soleus) relative to type II - rich muscle ( extensor digitorum longus) or type I and type II mixed muscle ( gastrocnemius) ( Figure 1A); this expression pattern closely resembles that of PGC - 1 alpha ( Lin et al. 2002).

The substantial increase of endogenous PPAR delta may have been caused by a switch to type I fiber ( see below), which intrinsically expresses higher levels of PPAR delta ( Figure 1A and 1B).	"PPAR delta	39	49	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"PPAR delta	160	170	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""PPAR delta"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""PPAR delta"", ""start_span"": 160, ""end_span"": 170, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Type I muscle can be readily distinguished from type II or mixed muscle by its red color, because of its high concentration of myoglobin, a protein typically expressed in oxidative muscle fibers.

We found that muscles in the transgenic mice appeared redder ( Figure 2A), which is particularly evident in the mixed type I / II fibers of the hindlimb ( Figure 2B).

More importantly, the specialized contraction protein troponin I ( slow) of type I fiber was robustly induced; this was accompanied by a marked reduction of the specialized contraction protein troponin I ( fast) of type II fiber, indicating a high degree of fiber transformation.

We next examined whether acute activation of endogenous PPAR delta would induce similar target genes.

By the end of this experiment, the control littermates became obese, whereas the transgenic mice still maintained a normal body weight and fat mass composition ( Figure 4A).

GW501516 produced a sustained induction of genes for type I muscle fibers; this, at least in part, resulted in an only 30% gain in body weight, a dramatically reduced fat mass accumulation, and improved glucose tolerance, compared to the vehicle - treated group ( Figure 5).	"genes	43	48	Sequence"	"glucose	203	210	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 203, ""end_span"": 210, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
However, whether the type I fibers generated molecularly via PPAR delta expression can contribute to enhanced performance in the absence of previous training is unclear.

Strikingly, the running time and distance the transgenic mice were able to sustain were increased by 67% and 92%, respectively ( Figure 6A; also see Videos S1 and S2).

The transgenic mice ran about 1 h longer than the controls, which translates to nearly a kilometer further.

"Our data reveal that a PPAR delta - mediated transcriptional pathway can regulate muscle fiber specification, enabling the generation of a strain of mice with a "" long - distance running "" phenotype."	"PPAR delta	23	33	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	149	153	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""PPAR delta"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 149, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
While induction of muscle oxidation enzymes by PPAR delta has been seen both in vivo and in vitro ( Muoio et al. 2002; Dressel et al. 2003; Luquet et al. 2003; Tanaka et al. 2003; Wang et al. 2003), its effects shown here on muscle fiber switching are unexpected.	"enzymes	36	43	Sequence"	"PPAR delta	47	57	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""enzymes"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""PPAR delta"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
It is important to note that, from our ligand and gain - of - function transgenic studies, PPAR delta needs to be activated in order to direct the muscle fiber switch.	"transgenic	71	81	Sequence"	"PPAR delta	91	101	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""transgenic"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""PPAR delta"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, PPAR delta activation, rather than merely an increase of PPAR delta levels, is an essential element for fiber switching and its associated functional manifestations.	"PPAR delta	6	16	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"PPAR delta	63	73	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""PPAR delta"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""PPAR delta"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
First, it is possible that exercise generates or increases endogenous ligands for PPAR delta as tissues are undergoing substantial increases in fatty - acid internalization and burning.	"PPAR delta	82	92	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"fatty - acid	144	156	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""PPAR delta"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""fatty - acid"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
A second model is that exercise may induce expression of PGC - 1 alpha ( Goto et al. 2000) and thereby activate PPAR delta.	"PGC - 1 alpha	57	70	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"PPAR delta	112	122	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""PPAR delta"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This is consistent with previous work in which we have shown that PGC - 1 alpha physically associates with PPAR delta in muscle tissue and can powerfully activate it even in the absence of ligands ( Wang et al. 2003).	"PGC - 1 alpha	66	79	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"PPAR delta	107	117	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""PPAR delta"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Further dissecting the interactions between PPAR delta and its regulatory components will be necessary to fully understand the molecular basis of muscle fiber determination pertinent to exercise training.

The multipotent, adhering epithelial cells are typically attached to an underlying basal lamina that polarizes the epithelial sheet and separates it from surrounding mesenchyme.

However, the process appears to be patterned at the initial stages of bud formation, since the relative importance of these pathways and their downstream effectors differ as buds begin to develop and cell fates are specified.

Bud formation differs from an EMT in that E - cadherin activity needs to be down - regulated but not prevented, so that adhesive junctions are remodeled rather than quantitatively impaired.

In the present study, we discovered that Snail is expressed briefly at an early stage of hair bud formation, when E - cadherin down - regulation and activation of proliferation take place.

Our studies point to the view that Snail likely functions downstream of cell fate specification, at a stage where the bud begins to exhibit enhanced proliferation and migration.

The transient nature of Snail mRNA expression during follicle development was most apparent in hybridized skin sections containing follicles from two different waves of morphogenesis ( as shown in Figure 1).

Consistent with the in situ hybridization results, anti - Snail antibody labeled only hair buds and not follicles at more mature stages of development ( Figure 1E).

Additionally, however, was a marked and variable expansion of keratin 5 ( K5), normally restricted to the innermost basal layer ( see Figure 3).

In these regions, immunofluorescence staining of E - cadherin and alpha - catenin were markedly diminished.

However, in regions such as ear skin, where the highest levels of Snail protein were expressed, the effects were accentuated.

Rather, the findings are consistent with a previous report that E - cadherin is required for the translation of alpha - catenin mRNA [ 22].

Coexpression of E - cadherin with Snail appeared to abrogate this effect.

Although this pathway provides one mechanism by which Snail expression and proliferation may be coupled in skin epithelium, proliferative circuitries involving AJs are known to be complex and often interwoven.	"Snail	54	59	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"AJs	160	163	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""AJs"", ""start_span"": 160, ""end_span"": 163, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Following this treatment, Snail protein was detected within 30 min, peaked at 2 h, and then declined thereafter.

Thus, although Snail expression correlated with phosphorylated SMAD2 ( pSMAD2) induction, its decline seemed to rely on secondary downstream events.

Consistent with previous observations [ 33], an anti - TGF - beta 2 antibody labeled developing hair buds ( Figure 6A).

In contrast, TGF - beta 2 signaling appeared to be an important factor for the early proliferation that occurs in the developing hair buds, as judged by anti - Ki67 and anti - pMAPK immunofluorescence ( Figure 6F and 6G).	"TGF - beta 2	13	25	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Ki67	160	164	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""TGF - beta 2"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Ki67"", ""start_span"": 160, ""end_span"": 164, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
As shown in Figure 6H, hair buds in TGF - beta 2 null skin displayed elevated immunofluorescence staining relative to their WT counterparts.	"TGF - beta 2	36	48	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"WT	124	126	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""TGF - beta 2"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""WT"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
These data suggest that during hair follicle morphogenesis, TGF - beta 2 functions subsequently to Wnt / noggin - mediated determination of hair fate.	"TGF - beta 2	60	72	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"noggin	105	111	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""TGF - beta 2"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""noggin"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The dynamic nuclear and cytosolic changes that take place during this time form the cornerstone for organ morphogenesis.

Two major challenges in understanding the mechanisms underlying a particular budding process are to order the temporal sequence of external cues involved and then to dissect how the cells of the developing bud translate these signals into the downstream events of cellular remodeling, proliferation, and differentiation.	"cells	182	187	Cell"	"cellular	264	272	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 182, ""end_span"": 187, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cellular"", ""start_span"": 264, ""end_span"": 272, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Hence, when TGF - beta 2 protein was detected at the transition between the growing and destructive phases of the adult hair cycle, research initially and naturally focused on a role for this family member in cessation of growth and / or triggering apoptosis ( [ 42] and references therein).	"TGF - beta 2	12	24	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"protein	25	32	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""TGF - beta 2"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
However, in contrast to TGF - beta 1 - null skin, which exhibits an extended growing phase of postnatal hair follicles, TGF - beta 2 - null skin displays an embryonic block in follicle bud progression [ 32].	"TGF - beta 1	24	36	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"TGF - beta 2	120	132	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""TGF - beta 1"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""TGF - beta 2"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, we surmise that the proliferative outcome is likely to be rooted in differences in the repertoire of activated SMAD target genes.

Additional contributing factors could be the multiplicity of Snail family members and their differential expression, the saturation, and / or diversity of regulatory mechanisms that govern AJ formation, migration, and proliferation in the follicle ORS.

The corresponding failure of E - cadherin down - regulation underscores the importance of Wnt / noggin signaling in regulating this event in follicle morphogenesis [ 4].

One of these appears to be Ajuba, which was previously shown to have the dual capacity to bind Grb - 2 as well as alpha - catenin [ 9, 10].

In stable epithelial ( i. e., Madin - Darby canine kidney, or MDCK) cell lines, Snail has been shown to block cell cycle progression and promote motility and shape changes for invasion [ 47].

While our in vivo studies are consistent with a role for Snail in motility and epithelial remodeling, they differ with respect to Snail ' s apparent proliferative effects.

Given that the exercise capacity of PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice is diminished, a series of preliminary treadmill exercise studies were performed to define a reasonable exercise duration for run - to - exhaustion to be used as a target duration for the EST.

The mean heart rate of the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice exhibited an inappropriate decline during the post exercise period ( Figure 5A).

The relative contribution of heart rate and stroke volume to diminished cardiac output in the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice could not be delineated, because both were decreased but neither to a significant degree ( Table 1).

In surveying the tissues of the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice, structural abnormalities of the brain were observed.

Neither microglial proliferation nor perivascular lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrates were noted in the PGC - 1 alpha - / - CNS.

Ultrastructural examination of the PGC - 1 alpha - / - parietal cerebral cortex confirmed the presence of microvacuolated neurons and neuropil ( Figure 10B).

However, gain - of - function strategies cannot determine whether PGC - 1 alpha is essential for critical energy metabolic processes including mitochondrial biogenesis and function.

Fourth, control of body fat mass is abnormal in the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice.

Finally, PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice do not respond normally to a variety of physiologic and dietary stresses known to increase oxidative energy demands.	"PGC - 1 alpha	9	22	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	29	33	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Taken together, these results strongly suggest that PGC - 1 alpha is necessary for the terminal stages of mitochondrial maturation necessary to meet the energy demands of the postnatal environment.	"PGC - 1 alpha	52	65	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mitochondrial	106	119	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mitochondrial"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Extensive phenotypic analyses demonstrated that mice lacking PGC - 1 alpha are unable to cope with physiologic stressors relevant to postnatal survival.	"mice	48	52	Organism"	"PGC - 1 alpha	61	74	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
For example, a skeletal muscle phenotype was unveiled in PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice under conditions in which energy supply becomes limiting.	"PGC - 1 alpha	57	70	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	77	81	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This was most clearly demonstrated by the profound abnormalities exhibited by PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice with exercise - to - exhaustion and repetitive muscle stimulation studies.	"PGC - 1 alpha	78	91	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	98	102	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Similarly, cardiac performance of PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice was compromised following severe exertion.	"PGC - 1 alpha	34	47	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	54	58	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The observation of fasting - induced hepatic steatosis is another example of the inability of PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice to respond to postnatal environmental metabolic demands.	"PGC - 1 alpha	94	107	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	114	118	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We found that after 18 wk of age, female PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice exhibit a mild but significantly abnormal weight increase associated with increased fat stores.	"PGC - 1 alpha	41	54	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	61	65	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
With further aging, a modest but significant increase in body fat was also noted in male PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice ( unpublished data).	"PGC - 1 alpha	89	102	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	109	113	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Clearly, future studies of male and female PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice in pure - strain backgrounds over a range of ages will be necessary to fully investigate the observed abnormalities in weight control and fat distribution.	"PGC - 1 alpha	43	56	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	63	67	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These findings are surprising, given the results of several recent studies demonstrating reduced expression of PGC - 1 alpha in human diabetic skeletal muscle [ 24, 34].	"PGC - 1 alpha	111	124	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"human	128	133	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
It is certainly possible that compensatory metabolic regulatory mechanisms have been activated in the PGC - 1 alpha - deficient mice, accounting for this observation.	"PGC - 1 alpha	102	115	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	128	132	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Alternatively, PGC - 1 alpha could serve as a coactivator of factors that mediate diet - induced insulin resistance.	"PGC - 1 alpha	15	28	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"insulin	97	104	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""insulin"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Histologic surveys of the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice revealed ultrastructural abnormalities in the central nervous system.	"PGC - 1 alpha	26	39	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	46	50	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These deficits are likely due to impaired muscle strength in the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice, but contributions by peripheral or central nervous system determinants ( or both) could be contributory.	"PGC - 1 alpha	65	78	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	85	89	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Moreover, evidence of altered emotionality from the 1 - h locomotor activity test also suggests the possibility of altered brain function in PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice.	"PGC - 1 alpha	141	154	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	161	165	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 161, ""end_span"": 165, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
It will be of interest to determine whether the neurologic abnormalities contribute to the systemic metabolic abnormalities of the PGC - 1 alpha null mice.

Both PGC - 1 alpha - deficient lines exhibit cold intolerance, reduced hepatocyte respiration rates, and neurologic lesions.

First, in contrast to Lin et al., the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice described here do not exhibit any postnatal mortality.

We have also found that male PGC - 1 alpha - deficient mice are somewhat protected against diet - induced obesity ( Figure S4).	"PGC - 1 alpha	29	42	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	55	59	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Fifth, Lin et al. found a neurologic phenotype in males characterized by hyperactivity, whereas the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice described here show reduced locomotor activity.	"PGC - 1 alpha	100	113	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	120	124	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The reasons for the interesting differences between the two PGC - 1 alpha - deficient mouse lines are not clear.

In addition, the incompletely penetrant postnatal mortality noted in the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice reported by Lin et al. could have resulted in a selection bias toward greater levels of compensatory responses in liver and other tissues in the surviving group.	"PGC - 1 alpha	73	86	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	93	97	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

If small amounts of PGC - 1 alpha activity are present in the mice reported here, it could explain some of the observed differences between the models.

Two ETS transcription factors of the Pea3 subfamily are induced in subpopulations of dorsal root ganglion ( DRG) sensory and spinal motor neurons by target - derived factors.

Together, our findings indicate that DRG sensory neurons exhibit a temporal developmental switch that can be revealed by distinct responses to ETS transcription factor signaling at sequential steps of neuronal maturation.

But whether the orderly expression and activity of transcriptional programs at much later developmental stages, well after cell cycle exit, is an essential step in the progression of neuronal differentiation and circuit assembly has yet to be resolved.

An emerging principle from work in Drosophila and vertebrates is that target - derived factors play a crucial role in the induction of these transcriptional programs [ 10].

In this study, we have used mouse genetics to test this general idea, by investigating whether the precise timing of onset of ETS transcription factor signaling is essential for normal sensory neuron development.

We find that within proprioceptive sensory neurons, the late onset of ETS signaling is essential for the establishment of normal sensory afferent projections in the spinal cord.

Our findings reveal that target - triggered inductive signals provide an effective means of ensuring the late onset of expression of transcription factors, and thus an orderly temporal transcriptional sequence that is crucial for neuronal maturation and circuit assembly.

We first defined an ETS transcription regulator that is able to replace the function of Er81 within proprioceptive afferents to direct projections into the ventral spinal cord.

These experiments permit assessment of whether precocious ETS transcription factor signaling influences neuronal survival and in vitro neurite outgrowth of DRG neurons, two parameters prominently influenced by target - derived neurotrophic factors and their receptors.

Addition of NGF, which supports survival of cutaneous afferents, resulted in straight and unbranched neurite outgrowth ( Figure 4B), while cultures grown in the presence of NT - 3, which supports survival of proprioceptive afferents, resulted in a highly branched neurite outgrowth pattern after 48 h in vitro ( Figure 4C).

More generally, they suggest that temporally regulated activation of transcriptional programs coupled to a particular fate induced in neurons at early developmental stages represents an important mechanism of neuronal maturation.

One striking observation of this study is that precocious induction of ETS signaling promotes neuronal survival without a requirement for neurotrophic support and in complete absence of Trk receptor expression.

The absence of Trk receptor expression upon precocious induction of ETS signaling can only partially explain the observed phenotype in axonal projections.

In the absence of NT - 3 signaling, development of central as well as peripheral proprioceptive afferent projections is perturbed [ 9].

In contrast, upon precocious induction of ETS signaling, we found more pronounced defects in the establishment of central rather than peripheral projections for all DRG neurons.

Interestingly, several ETS transcription factors are activated through release of autoinhibition via interaction with cofactors and / or via post - translational modifications [ 35, 36, 37].

Unless otherwise stated, mice were maintained on a complete elemental liquid diet ( Peptamen; Nestle Deerfield, IL) to prevent intestinal obstruction that occurs in CF mice [ 52].

In some experiments, 8 week old mice were transferred onto solid mouse chow instead of Peptamen, and survival was recorded.

The Genome Scanning Service of The Jackson Laboratory ( Bar Harbor, ME) was used to determine the contributions of C57Bl / 6 and 129 / Sv strains in the interbred mice.

We analyzed the sequence of each Tas2r allele in the parental strains ( B6 and D2) and 29 RI lines.

After initially screening B6 and D2 mice to determine stimulus concentrations that were aversive but not saturating [ 47], we selected two ligand concentrations for each compound that best differentiated the two strains.

Avoidance by male and female B6 and D2 mice increased ( as indicated by the decreased lick ratio) in a concentration - dependent manner for both compounds ( Figure 1A; Table 1).

D2 mice displayed decreased aversion relative to B6 mice at both concentrations.	"mice	3	7	Organism"	"mice	52	56	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The chromosome 6 QTL was linked to a single marker, D6Mit13 ( Table 2, Figure 3).

Adjacent proximal markers D6Mit254 and D6Mit194 are unlinked to the QHCl QTL, as is distal marker D6Mit374.

Across the 17 RI lines tested there is at least one recombination event between D6Mit13 and either D6Mit254 ( and D6Mit194, the physical position of which is not well defined) or D6Mit374.	"position	137	145	Sequence"	"D6Mit374	179	187	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""position"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""D6Mit374"", ""start_span"": 179, ""end_span"": 187, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The QHCl QTL is linked to a single marker on chromosome 6.	"QTL	9	12	Sequence"	"chromosome	45	55	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""QTL"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""chromosome"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"

Therefore, we proceeded to screen genomic DNA from 29 available BXD RI lines, including the 17 that we had used in taste testing, for the Tas2r alleles they contained.	"genomic DNA	34	45	Sequence"	"alleles	144	151	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""genomic DNA"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""alleles"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
In most cases, we were able to identify diagnostic restriction endonuclease digests that would allow us to quickly identify whether a particular Tas2r PCR product was amplified from a B6 or D2 allele.	"PCR product	151	162	Sequence"	"allele	193	199	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""PCR product"", ""start_span"": 151, ""end_span"": 162, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""allele"", ""start_span"": 193, ""end_span"": 199, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Surprisingly, we discovered that there have been no apparent recombination events within the distal chromosome 6 cluster during the generation of the BXD RI lines.	"chromosome	100	110	GO_ontology"	"cluster	113	120	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""chromosome"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""cluster"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Each Tas2r within an individual BXD strain originated from the same parental strain ( B6 allele = gray, D2 allele = white).	"allele	89	95	Sequence"	"allele	107	113	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""allele"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""allele"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
B6 mice ( blue line on left panel) are more sensitive to 1 mM and 3 mM QHCl than are D2 mice ( red line on left panel) in brief access taste tests.	"mice	3	7	Organism"	"mice	88	92	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Similarly, BXD strains with the B6 Tas2r haplotype ( blue lines, right panel) are more sensitive to QHCl than are BXD strains with the D2 Tas2r haplotype ( red lines, right panel).	"haplotype	41	50	Sequence"	"haplotype	144	153	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""haplotype"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""haplotype"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Tas2rs are the most likely candidates for the QHCl quantitative trait gene ( s) due to: ( 1) their expression in taste receptor cells and ( 2) genetic and functional evidence linking them to the detection of a number of bitter taste stimuli.	"taste receptor cells	113	133	Cell"	"genetic	143	150	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""taste receptor cells"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""genetic"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
It will be interesting to determine whether this suggestive QTL is linked to quinine taste and, if so, whether it is specific for this single bitter stimulus or more broadly related to all bitter taste.	"QTL	60	63	Sequence"	"quinine	77	84	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""QTL"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""quinine"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Of the 29 BXD RI lines examined, there was no apparent recombination event within the chromosome 6 Tas2r cluster.	"chromosome	86	96	GO_ontology"	"cluster	105	112	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""chromosome"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""cluster"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
While increasing the number of BXD RI lines or the number of markers used for genotyping them would facilitate the definition of smaller QTL intervals, in this case such an effort is unlikely to permit the identification of one or a few Tas2rs involved in quinine taste.	"QTL intervals	137	150	Sequence"	"quinine	256	263	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""QTL intervals"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""quinine"", ""start_span"": 256, ""end_span"": 263, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Positional cloning also permitted the identification of the Tas2r responsible for the majority of variance of phenylthiocarbamide ( PTC) taste sensitivity in humans [ 18].

Interestingly, 23% of missense mutations in D2 Tas2rs affect the first two extracellular loops of the receptors.

Such large numbers of nonsynonymous substitutions between orthologues is suggestive of adaptive selection.

Characterization of Tas2r sequences of several wild mouse species or subspecies, or in other inbred lines, would shed light on this issue.

This tolerance may help to preserve the ability of T2R - expressing, bitter - sensitive taste cells to respond to a wide array of potentially toxic stimuli.

The amount and rate at which bone is gained during development and lost during aging are determined in large part by genetics [ 4 - 6] but also by physical activity and by alterations in the availability and response of bone cells to circulating hormones [ 7 - 9] and locally derived growth factors [ 10, 11].

Aging has long been associated with an increase in marrow fat, where the generation of adipocytes is favored over osteoblasts [ 23].

Sam68 - / - mice did, however, have difficulty breeding due to male infertility and the females rarely provided adequate care to their young.

Similarly, a greater increase in BMC was seen in the femur and vertebra in the Sam68 - / - mice.

These data showed that Sam68 - / - mice continued to thrive and accrue bone in the axial and appendicular skeleton for longer than 12 months.

These reductions were associated with a significant increase in marrow fat ( FV / TV) and decreased numbers of osteoblasts ( nOB / TV) and osteoclasts ( nOC / TV) per tissue volume ( Table 3).	"osteoblasts	111	122	Cell"	"osteoclasts	139	150	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""osteoblasts"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""osteoclasts"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Maintenance of bone mass during the adult remodeling cycle is dependent on the coupling of osteoblast to osteoclast activity, such that there is no net gain or loss of bone [ 49].	"osteoblast	91	101	Cell"	"osteoclast	105	115	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""osteoblast"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""osteoclast"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Therefore, the loss of Sam68 could influence the bone marrow stromal cells to differentiate along the osteogenic versus the adipogenic pathway.

Alternatively, the loss of Sam68 could indirectly regulate bone mass as a general disturbance of neuroendocrine control as was shown when leptin and the sympathetic nervous system axis were shown to negatively regulate bone mass [ 8].

The primary Sam68 - / - MEFs were differentiated into adipocytes in vitro in culture medium containing 5 mu M pioglitazone to induce adipogenesis.

The expression of Sam68 was reduced by approximately 80% as evidenced by immunoblot analyses using beta - actin as a loading control ( Figure 8A).

Traditional histology and histomorphometry suggested that the mechanism involved preservation of osteoblast and osteoclast activity.

The fact that Capn4 null mice die during embryogenesis indicates that at least one of the ubiquitous calpains is essential for development to term.

Correct targeting of the Capn2 locus was established both by Southern blot hybridization and PCR analysis.	"Capn2	25	30	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"locus	31	36	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Capn2"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""locus"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
( A) Targeted disruption of the Capn2 locus was detected initially by Southern blotting.

This suggested that Capn2 - / - animals perished at some stage during embryonic development.	"Capn2	20	25	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"animals	32	39	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Capn2"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Both of these Capn2 - / - embryos were isolated at the 8 - cell stage and did not display any obvious morphological defects.

The scarcity of Capn2 - deficient embryos surviving to the 8 - cell stage suggested that the loss of m - calpain activity must fatally compromise the viability of early embryos.	"Capn2	16	21	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cell	63	67	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Capn2"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Due to the scarcity of extractable genetic material, a nested PCR strategy was developed in order to genotype pre - implantation embryos.

This was first used to disrupt the Capn4 gene, encoding the small regulatory subunit common to both mu - and m - calpain.	"Capn4	35	40	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"gene	41	45	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Capn4"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""gene"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Two independent laboratories observed embryonic lethality in Capn4 knockout mice, albeit at different stages of development [ 31, 32].

These observations supported the hypothesis that the small subunit is required for both mu - and m - calpain, and furthermore suggested four possibilities regarding their requirement for embryonic development: 1) both isoforms were required; 2) mu - calpain was required; 3) m - calpain was required, or 4) mu - and m - calpain are redundant, and one or the other isoform was required.	"isoforms	218	226	Sequence"	"isoform	364	371	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""isoforms"", ""start_span"": 218, ""end_span"": 226, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""isoform"", ""start_span"": 364, ""end_span"": 371, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
A similar effect might be at work in the two Capn4 transgenic lines.

The two enzymes share 62% sequence identity and are very similar in their structure and biochemistry.

It is now clear, from the gene targeting work done in mice, that mu - and m - calpain have some distinct physiological roles, at least during embryogenesis.	"gene	26	30	Sequence"	"mice	54	58	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""gene"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Both mu - and m - calpain activities are present in most mammalian cells, although the published data, owing to weaknesses in the available methodology, do not provide reliable estimates of their relative amounts.	"mammalian	57	66	Organism"	"cells	67	72	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""mammalian"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Platelets and erythrocytes contain abundant mu - calpain activity, while m - calpain activity is barely detectable.

As a result, it is not possible to determine whether the absence of marked phenotype in Capn1 - / - animals is due to a compensatory affect by the remaining m - calpain activity, or whether the functions of mu - calpain are simply not essential.	"Capn1	88	93	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"animals	100	107	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Capn1"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In contrast, lethality in Capn2 - / - embryos demonstrates that m - calpain activity is essential for embryonic development beyond the 8 - cell stage.	"Capn2	26	31	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cell	139	143	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Capn2"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In other cases, however, the gene disruption is thought to compromise fatally the viability of cells in the early embryo [ 3, 39 - 43].

There have been several reports of m - calpain involvement in cell proliferation in certain circumstances, including reports of its involvement in chromosome segregation during mitosis [ 44] as well as during meiosis [ 45].

It is widely accepted that the cerebellum is involved in the performance of the rotating rod task, since mice with structural abnormalities in the cerebellum [ 31] or with disruptions in genes enriched in the cerebellum [ 32] exhibit performance deficits in this task.

These data suggest the basis for the performance deficit on the rotating rod task in the Syt IV mutants is in motor coordination rather than in motor learning.

The results in the present study showed that ADAM11 - deficient mice slightly, though not significantly, improved motor learning ability during rotating rod performance.

To examine motor learning ability in ADAM11 - deficient mice in detail, we will need to use other cerebellar - dependent learning tasks, such as a classical eyelid conditioning test.

Spontaneous motor activity and walking patterns of ADAM11 - deficient mice were also found to be normal, suggesting that the dysfunction found in the rotating rod test was not derived from muscle weakness or other peripheral disturbances.

These results suggest that limited brain sites, mainly the hippocampus and cerebellum, might contribute to the dominant phenotype, spatial learning impairment and motor discoordination in ADAM11 - deficient mice.

It is unlikely that morphological changes during development led to impairment of spatial learning and motor coordination, and morphological alterations in the cytoarchitecture of the hippocampus and cerebellum were not observed in ADAM11 - deficient mice after histological investigation using HE staining.

However, the absence of Dhh indicated that not all Sertoli pathways are initiated.

This result suggests that Fgf9 is necessary for the down - regulation of Wnt4 in differentiating XY gonads at / after bipotential stages.

These results demonstrate antagonism between WNT4 and FGF9 under in vitro gain - of - function conditions.

To test antagonism between these factors under loss - of - function conditions in vivo, we investigated whether Fgf9 is derepressed in the absence of Wnt4 ( Figure 6A - 6C).

This result suggested that FGF9 is normally down - regulated by WNT4 in XX gonads.

Wnt4 - / - XX gonads do not increase in size comparable to normal XY gonads ( Figure 6C, 6F, 6I, and 6L), and Sertoli cell differentiation and testis cord formation do not occur.

This model is appealing, because it links cell proliferation, believed to be required for establishment of the male pathway [ 9], with Sertoli fate determination.

It has been suggested that SOX9 represses WNT4 based on misexpression studies [ 48].

In those two misexpression cases, Sox9 expression may have been artificially sustained by exogenous regulatory sequences that bypass the fine dosage balance in this signaling network.

These findings suggest that WNT4 signaling normally acts as a repressor of the male pathway by interfering with the up - regulation of SOX9 expression.

One report of a duplication of the region of human Chromosome 1, which includes WNT4, led to an intersex phenotype [ 53].

Such a role is not supported by efforts to misexpress Wnt4 in XY gonads, which have led to very mild phenotypes with no evidence for defects in Sertoli cell differentiation [ 54].	"Wnt4	54	58	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Sertoli cell	144	156	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Wnt4"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Sertoli cell"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Consistent with our data and the partially sex - reversed phenotype of Wnt4 - / - XX mutants, other WNTs or additional female factors may be required.

This results in the down - regulation of Sox9 and Fgf9, tilting the balance toward commitment to the female pathway.

In contrast, we find that the loss of both BMP2 and BMP4 results in a severe impairment of osteogenesis.	"BMP2	43	47	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	52	56	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, because different members of this group often have similar effects on target cells and are produced in overlapping regions of the embryo and hence can be redundant with one another, removal of any single member of the BMP family may not reveal the full extent of the roles they play during development.	"cells	86	91	Cell"	"BMP	227	230	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 227, ""end_span"": 230, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
For example, during limb development, BMPs have been postulated to act sequentially in multiple distinct aspects of patterning, cell type specification, and differentiation of various tissues, particularly of the skeleton.	"BMPs	38	42	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cell	128	132	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""BMPs"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Differences in anterior - posterior pattern are instructed as a graded response to Sonic Hedghog ( SHH) signaling emanating from the posterior margin of the limb bud [ 5].	"Sonic Hedghog	83	96	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"SHH	99	102	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Sonic Hedghog"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""SHH"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Both are expressed in a broader domain than SHH in the early posterior limb bud mesenchyme [ 6, 7], although BMP7 also has a second, weaker domain of expression in the anterior limb bud mesenchyme.	"SHH	44	47	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP7	109	113	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""SHH"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP7"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Moreover, BMP signaling has a weak ability to posteriorly polarize the limb in ectopic grafting experiments [ 10], an activity enhanced by prior low - level exposure to SHH [ 11].	"BMP	10	13	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"SHH	169	172	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""SHH"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 172, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Bmp2 mutant embryos die too early to assess their limb phenotypes.

Nonetheless, Bmp7 knockout mice do not show any defect in limb polarity.	"Bmp7	13	17	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	27	31	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Bmp7"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Thus, BMP4 is not a candidate for a secondary signal downstream of SHH in early patterning.	"BMP4	6	10	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"SHH	67	70	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""SHH"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
As a consequence of the initial establishment of anterior - posterior positioned information within the limb by SHH and / or BMP signaling, the interdigital mesenchyme of the hand plate becomes specified in a graded manner.	"SHH	112	115	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP	125	128	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""SHH"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
For example, ectopic application of BMP antagonists demonstrates that BMP signaling is necessary for this process, and in its absence, webbing occurs [ 17 - 19]).	"BMP	36	39	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP	70	73	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
SHH activity leads to the upregulation of the BMP antagonist Gremlin in the mesenchyme [ 20, 21].	"SHH	0	3	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP	46	49	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""SHH"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This, in turn, prevents BMPs from downregulating fibroblast growth factor ( FGF) production in the AER [ 17, 22] and maintains the integrity of the AER itself [ 23].	"BMPs	24	28	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"fibroblast	49	59	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""BMPs"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""fibroblast"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Thus, conditional removal of BMP4 activity from the posterior limb mesenchyme results in a persistence of the AER, expanded SHH signaling, and consequent preaxial and postaxial polydactyly [ 16].	"BMP4	29	33	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"SHH	124	127	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""SHH"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Similarly, when noggin, a potent BMP inhibitor, is introduced in early stage chick limb buds prior to skeletogenesis, mesenchymal condensation does not take place [ 27, 28].	"noggin	16	22	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP	33	36	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""noggin"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Conversely, removal of individual ligands such as BMP4 [ 16] or BMP7 [ 12, 13] has not displayed defects in skeletal differentiation, presumably due to functional redundancy.	"BMP4	50	54	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP7	64	68	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP7"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, at later stages, the combined loss of BMP2 and BMP4 evidently becomes limiting, and osteogenesis ceases.	"BMP2	47	51	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	56	60	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
As all prior reported manipulations of the BMP pathway during skeletal development either result in a block at the first stage of chondrogenesis or allow complete skeletal formation, this is the first demonstration of a requirement for BMP activity in osteogenic differentiation.	"BMP	43	46	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP	236	239	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 236, ""end_span"": 239, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

However, BMP2 and BMP4 are both required for viability early in embryonic development [ 30, 31].

Bmp2 is first expressed in the limb mesenchyme at embryonic day ( E) 10. 5 in the mouse ( Figure 1A, asterisk).

At E10. 5 Bmp4 is expressed in the mouse limb mesenchyme in two stripes at the anterior and posterior margins ( Figure 1C, red arrows).

To obtain an initial indication of the range of phenotypes produced in these animals, we first examined the limb skeletons of newborn animals.

BMP2 - deficient limbs appeared remarkably normal, both in skeletal pattern and in gross aspects of chondrogenesis and osteogenesis indicated by Alcian blue / Alizarin red staining.

They also display the same scapular defects seen in Bmp2C / C; Prx1:: cre mice, and the overall size of the appendicular skeleton is slightly diminished.	"Prx1	63	67	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	74	78	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Prx1"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
As noted above, Bmp2 - deficient animals display a variably penetrant 3 / 4 soft tissue syndactyly phenotype ( Figure 2B).

In contrast, Bmp4 - deficient mice show no evidence of syndactyly ( unpublished data).

In wild - type development, the individual digits become free from one another through a process of interdigital apoptosis, observable by staining with acridine orange ( Figure 2E and 2G, arrow).

( Note that the strong acridine orange staining in Figure 2H is not in the interdigital mesenchyme but rather is in the remnant of the cells of the AER [ red asterisk].)	"acridine	23	31	Chemical"	"cells	135	140	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""acridine"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
One of the phenotypes characterizing the Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre mutant is expansion of the AER ( see below).	"Prx1	63	67	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutant	74	80	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Prx1"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
The AER displays intense staining with acridine orange, TUNEL, or other markers for apoptosis at every stage when it is present, reflecting the rapid turnover of cells in this structure [ 33 - 35].	"acridine	39	47	Chemical"	"cells	162	167	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""acridine"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 162, ""end_span"": 167, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The first of these is in establishing differences along the anterior - posterior axis of the limb downstream of sonic hedgehog ( Shh).	"sonic hedgehog	112	126	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Shh	129	132	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""sonic hedgehog"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Shh"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Indeed, in the hindlimbs, where the penetrance of the phenotype is variable, the mutant middle digits are otherwise indistinguishable from wild - type, other than the presence or absence of this variable skeletal element.	"mutant	81	87	Sequence"	"wild - type	139	150	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""wild - type"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
By E11. 5, the Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre limb buds are noticeably broader, expanded in the posterior relative to wild - type.	"Prx1	37	41	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"wild - type	120	131	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Prx1"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""wild - type"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
This correlates with an anterior expansion in Shh expression ( Figure 3E and 3F, red bracket) and a concomitant expansion of the AER as visualized by Fgf8 expression ( Figure 3G and 3H, red bracket).	"Shh	46	49	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Fgf8	150	154	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Shh"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Fgf8"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The expansion in Shh expression can first be detected at E10. 5 and persists at least until E12. 5, well after the time normal Shh expression disappears at E11. 75 ( Figure 3L and 3P).	"Shh	17	20	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Shh	127	130	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Shh"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Shh"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Because Shh expression is, reciprocally, supported by FGF signaling from the AER [ 8, 24], this, in turn, feeds back on the ZPA, expanding Shh expression.	"Shh	8	11	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Shh	139	142	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Shh"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Shh"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
To examine the loss of digits more closely, BMP2, BMP4 - deficient limb buds were examined during cartilage condensation phase of the digit rays at E12. 5.	"BMP2	44	48	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	50	54	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, in Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre limb buds at E12. 5, Sox9 only detects primordia of the anterior three digits of the forelimb, indicating a failure in the formation of posterior digits at this earliest stage ( Figure 3J).	"Prx1	34	38	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Sox9	66	70	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Prx1"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Sox9"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The loss of the posterior forelimb digits in these mice thus does not appear to represent a decrease in polarizing activity leading to a change in digit identity rather a consequence of the overall level of BMP signaling falling below a threshold for initiating chondrogenesis in the posterior of these forelimbs.	"mice	51	55	Organism"	"BMP	207	210	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 207, ""end_span"": 210, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The posterior of the hindlimb in the mutant, in contrast, appears to remain above this threshold, and more than five digit condensations form in the hindlimb bud ( Figures 3K and 1S) and no ectopic expression of Msx2 is observed in the posterior ( Figure 3O).

In contrast, however, limbs completely deficient in both BMP2 and BMP4 activity showed severe defects in skeletal differentiation.

Similarly, at E13. 5, the entire limb skeleton could be visualized undergoing chondrogenesis by Alcian blue staining, albeit in a defective pattern, in the BMP2, BMP4 - deficient limb buds ( Figure 4A and 4B and unpublished data).	"BMP2	156	160	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	162	166	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 156, ""end_span"": 160, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 162, ""end_span"": 166, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Histological examination of the humeri at E13. 5 showed that while chondrogenic differentiation had taken place in the BMP2, BMP4 - deficient humerus, hypertrophic differentiation was delayed ( Figure 4C and 4D).

Osteogenesis Is Initiated Normally in BMP2, BMP4 - Deficient Limb Buds	"BMP2	38	42	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	44	48	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
By E17. 5, the mineralized cartilage that makes up the late hypertrophic zone of the growth plate normally undergoes removal by osteoclasts ( Figure 5G, brown - stained cells, red arrows), resulting in the formation of a bone marrow cavity ( red arrow in Figure 5E and 5I, see also Figure 6).

In contrast, in E17. 5 limbs deficient in BMP2 and BMP4, there is an overall delay in the normal endochondral process ( Figure 5F).	"BMP2	42	46	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	51	55	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
As shown in Figure 6A through 6E, in the control mice, a bone collar is found adjacent to the zone of late hypertrophic chondrocytes at 1 wk ( Figure 6A and 6B).

In stark contrast, bone formation is not observed in the absence of BMP2 and BMP4 at 1 or 3 wks after birth ( Figure 6F - 6J).	"BMP2	68	72	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	77	81	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The appearance of the skeletal elements in the double mutants remains similar to E17. 5 structures seen in wild - type limbs ( Figure 5E), and although there is a bone collar at the site of hypertrophic cartilage ( Figure 6G), no bone marrow cavity, trabecular bone, or cortical bone is present ( Figure 6F).

The resorption of bone at 3 wks of age is clearly visible in the proximal femur of mutant animals where a portion of that bone is missing ( Figure 6L, black arrow).

However, BMP2 and BMP4 are required in concert to promote condensation of the posterior digit anlagen.	"BMP2	9	13	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	18	22	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
On the other hand, BMP2 and BMP4 together are required for completion of osteogenesis.	"BMP2	19	23	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	28	32	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Application of the BMP antagonist noggin to the interdigital tissue at the time of digit condensation results in loss of phalanges and a resultant pattern that can be interpreted as an anterior homeotic transformation in digit identity.	"BMP	19	22	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"noggin	34	40	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""noggin"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, if levels of BMP signaling were instructive in terms of digit identities, then a substantial decrease in the amount of BMP ligand present should cause transformations in digit identity.	"BMP	22	25	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP	128	131	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
It is worth noting that the defects in chondrogenesis seen in the BMP2, BMP4 - deficient limbs are much more severe proximally than distally.	"BMP2	66	70	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	72	76	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Finally, differences in genetic background could contribute to the differences as the Prx1:: cre line is outbred.	"genetic	24	31	Sequence"	"Prx1	86	90	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""genetic"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Prx1"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, loss of both BMP2 and BMP4 results in complete soft tissue syndactyly, i. e., webbing between all the digits.	"BMP2	22	26	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	31	35	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Although BMP activity has been previously implicated in regulating interdigital apoptosis, this is the first genetic verification of their requirement for this process.	"BMP	9	12	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"genetic	109	116	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""genetic"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Recent biochemical and genetic experiments have suggested that individual BMPs have identical functions.

We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that BMP2 and BMP4 have distinct functions in osteoblastogenesis.	"BMP2	49	53	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	58	62	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Our analysis of skeletogenesis indicates that BMP2 and BMP4 are prerequisite for osteoblastogenesis while less important for chondrogenesis.	"BMP2	46	50	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	55	59	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
These studies provide the first evidence linking BMP2 and BMP4 with bone formation in an in vivo setting where the preceding events of chondrogenesis are not compromised.

First, we performed genome linkage analysis in F2 progeny of the CIA susceptible and resistant strains to search for small - effect QTL.

The candidate genes were identified using three criteria: they are located in a genomic region linked to CIA; they are disease - specific differentially expressed during CIA; and they are strain - specific differentially expressed regarding the two parental strains.

Most of these genomic regions did not reach a genome - wide significant threshold value of linkage, with P values between 0. 05 and 0. 001 [ 1 - 5].

The potential candidate genes were identified based on three criteria: they are located within the genomic region linked to CIA; they are disease - specific differentially expressed during CIA; and they are strain - specific differentially expressed between the two parental strains during CIA.

In a previous study, we carried out a genome screen to identify QTL controlling CIA susceptibility in ( DBA / 1 x FVB / N) F2 progeny.

For the phenotype of arthritis severity, only one QTL, Cia2, was identified, with a highly significant logarithm of the odds ( LOD) score of 12 [ 10].

However, Cia2 contributed to only 16% of the phenotype variations, indicating that there should be some small - effect QTL whose contributions to CIA were not big enough to reach the significant threshold value of linkage.	"Cia2	9	13	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"QTL	119	122	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Cia2"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""QTL"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
These eight small - effect QTL were located on chromosomes 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 16, and 17.

Lander and Botstein [ 26] suggested a LOD score of between 2 and 3 to ensure an overall false positive rate of 5%, which means that using a lower threshold value will prevent false negative QTL at the expense of increasing false positive QTL.

On day 10 after immunisation, 102 genes were differentially expressed - most of them were upregulated ( 78 out of 102) - while at the onset phase of the disease, only 26 genes were differentially expressed.

GO term classification analysis revealed that the functional cluster of protein kinase cascade was significantly enriched in the 21 candidate genes.

Although not significant, there is evidence that most of the eight small - effect QTL likely contain susceptibility genes for CIA.	"QTL	82	85	Sequence"	"genes	116	121	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""QTL"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Five of the eight small - effect QTL were identified in at least two datasets, suggesting that these QTL are reproducible.

Interestingly, loci 2 and 7 partially overlap with two arthritis - related QTL identified by us in the same F2 progeny [ 10].	"loci	15	19	Sequence"	"QTL	75	78	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""loci"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""QTL"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Furthermore, according to our unpublished data, loci 8 on chromosome 17 controls lymphocyte adherence during development of CIA.

Therefore, the gene within the small - effect QTL could affect CIA severity through controlling arthritis - related phenotypes.

We present an extensive study of gene expression patterns in LNs of both genetically susceptible and resistant strains at four different phases of CIA.

In both strains, differentially regulated genes were highly concentrated at the PI and CA phases, and only a small number of genes were differentially expressed in two or three phases.

These differences could explain why a higher antibody response to collagen II occurred in the DBA / 1 strain compared to the FVB / N strain, and might partially explain the difference of the susceptibility to CIA between both strains.

Therefore, we have presented a strategy to identify small - effect QTL and search for potential candidate genes within them.

On the genome level, some of the eight small - effect QTL identified using a very low threshold value ( P < 0. 05) could be false positives.

For example, locus 4 was identified with a low P value and does not overlap with any previously identified arthritis QTL.

Furthermore, the differential expression of a gene could result not only from allele difference between two strains, but also from other factors.

With this strategy, we identified 21 candidate genes for 8 small - effect QTL regulating CIA susceptibility.

Thereafter, we will generate knock - out mice to investigate the role of the genes in CIA.

Pygo2 homozygous mutants, with rare exception, died shortly after birth, with a phenotype including lens agenesis, growth retardation, altered kidney development, and in some cases exencephaly and cleft palate.

The mammalian Pygopus genes are required for normal branching morphogenesis of the ureteric bud during kidney development.

Nevertheless, the relatively mild phenotype observed in the kidney, as well as other organ systems, indicates a striking evolutionary divergence of Pygopus function between mammals and Drosophila.

The resulting double - homozygous mutant embryos showed a context - dependent reduction in canonical Wnt signaling as measured by Wnt reporter transgene expression.

The obvious conclusion is that in mammals, unlike Drosophila, Pygopus - mediated canonical Wnt signaling is not absolutely necessary in most developing organ systems.

BAT - gal reporter analysis of the Pygo mutants at a later developmental stage, E18. 5, also identified a significant decrease in canonical Wnt signaling in the cortical ureteric branches and renal pelvis of the developing kidney ( Figure 6M - O).

Bisection revealed a significant loss of X - gal staining cells in the collecting ducts and renal pelvis of the Pygo2 null kidney compared with control littermates ( Figure 6N).

Interestingly, however, even in wild - type mice the BAT - gal reporter showed no expression in the developing metanephric mesenchyme, or metanephric mesenchyme - derived structures, such as renal vesicles, S - shaped bodies, tubules, and glomeruli.

To address this question, we incubated E11. 5 metanephric mesenchyme in lithium chloride ( LiCl), which activates canonical Wnt signaling through inhibition of GSK3, and also functions as an inducer of nephrogenesis in kidney organ culture [ 22].

We observed that LiCl - treated metanephric mesenchyme did undergo nephrogenesis, as expected, but failed to show BAT - gal expression ( data not shown), suggesting that this transgene is not an accurate reporter of canonical Wnt signaling in the metanephric mesenchyme of the developing kidney.

These observations raise the possibility that in yeast, Pch2p responds to synapsis polymerization rather than initiation.

Our results demonstrate that in mice, the primary meiotic function of TRIP13 is in recombination itself.

Our data suggest that while recombination events destined to be resolved as COs can proceed normally in Trip13 mutants, DSBs that enter the NCO repair pathway are incompletely resolved or processed inefficiently.

However, the exact role of TRIP13 ( or Pch2) in recombination is unclear.

We base this conclusion on two observations: ( 1) oocyte elimination is dependent upon DSB formation and ( 2) synapsis is normal in spermatocytes of adult testes.
