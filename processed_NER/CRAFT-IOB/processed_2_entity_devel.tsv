Mucolipidosis type IV ( MLIV; MIM 252650) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder that is characterized by corneal clouding, delayed psychomotor development, and mental retardation that usually presents during the first year of life [ 1].

Protein trafficking studies suggest that MLIV is the result of a defect in the late endocytic pathway, contrary to the other mucolipidoses which are typically caused by defective lysosomal hydrolases [ 11, 12].

These findings represent a novel role for T - box gene action in embryonic development, identify a previously unappreciated aspect of dorsoventral patterning that is widely represented in furred mammals, and provide insight into the mechanisms that underlie region - specific differences in body morphology.

Among these, pigment patterns are an excellent system to investigate how morphological differences arise, both for different regions of the body within a species and for different animals from closely related species.

In the embryo, alterations in the determination or migration of melanoblasts from the neural crest affect the number or distribution of pigment cells in the skin ( reviewed in Reedy et al. 1998).

"A "" hair cycle - specific "" transcript is expressed in both dorsal and ventral skin for 2 - 3 days during early hair growth, while a "" ventral - specific "" transcript is expressed throughout the entire period of active hair growth, but only in ventral skin ( Bultman et al. 1994; Vrieling et al. 1994)."

To better understand the mechanisms that give rise to differences between dorsal and ventral skin and to the boundary between them, we have determined how several morphologic characteristics vary along the dorsoventral axis of the mouse and how these characteristics correspond to ventral - specific Agouti expression and the lineage boundary that distinguishes somite from lateral plate derivatives.	"mouse	231	236	Organism"	"Agouti	300	306	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 231, ""end_span"": 236, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Agouti"", ""start_span"": 300, ""end_span"": 306, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Our results indicate that the apparent uniformity of the dorsoventral boundary represents the sum of independent mechanisms that affect melanocyte density and / or differentiation, pigment - type synthesis, and hair length; surprisingly, none of these coincide with the somite - lateral plate lineage boundary.

Embryonic expression and transplantation studies suggest that Tbx15 is required to establish certain characteristics of dorsal patterning in mesenchymal cells of the developing flank.	"Tbx15	62	67	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mesenchymal cells	141	158	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Tbx15"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mesenchymal cells"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Semiquantitative measurements of hair length plotted as a function of dorsoventral position reveal that the apparent sharp boundary between dorsal and ventral pigment compartments in at / at mice coincides with a more gradual change in both hair color and hair length ( Figure 1A - 1D).	"pigment	159	166	Chemical"	"mice	191	195	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""pigment"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 166, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 191, ""end_span"": 195, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, the region of transition for hair length is considerably broader than that for pigmentation and independent of Agouti genotype.	"Agouti	120	126	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"genotype	127	135	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Agouti"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""genotype"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Taken together, these observations indicate that variation of hair length along the dorsoventral axis is stereotyped and maintained through multiple hair cycles, with a transition in hair length that is gradual and encompasses the pigment - type transition in at / at mice.	"pigment	231	238	Chemical"	"mice	268	272	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""pigment"", ""start_span"": 231, ""end_span"": 238, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 268, ""end_span"": 272, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In age - matched inbred mice, we observed a small decrease in the ratio of undercoat hairs ( zigzags) to overcoat hairs ( auchenes, awls, and guard hairs) in dorsum compared to ventrum ( Figure 1E), but there was no consistent difference in hair - type distribution for outbred mice ( data not shown).

Melanin content of individual hairs is likely to be influenced both by the number of pigment cells and their follicular environment.

Regardless, dorsoventral differences in hair pigment content of ae / ae mice persist throughout multiple hair cycles into adulthood, similar to hair length ( but unlike skin thickness).

The proportion of the ventral cream - colored region is also expanded a small amount, 47. 9% in mutant compared to 37. 8% in nonmutant animals, but expansion of the lateral region, which occurs at all levels of the body, including the limbs and the cranium ( but not the whisker pad), is the major feature responsible for the ventralized appearance caused by deH.

Overall, deH causes a small but consistent reduction in hair length in both dorsum and ventrum; when mutant and nonmutant animals are normalized for body circumference, reduced hair length is most apparent in the lateral region ( Figure 2E).	"mutant	101	107	Sequence"	"animals	122	129	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The skin of ae / ae neonates appears uniformly dark over the entire dorsum, but in ae / ae; deH / deH neonates, the area of dark skin is more restricted, particularly above the limbs, and resembles the pattern of dorsal eumelanin in at / at; deH / deH adult animals.

As described below, the gene defective in deH, Tbx15, is normally expressed in the dorsal region and therefore is likely to play a role in establishing the size and dorsal extent of the lateral region.	"gene	24	28	Sequence"	"Tbx15	47	52	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""gene"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Tbx15"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Animals heterozygous for the targeted allele are completely normal with regard to size, skeletal morphology, and hair - color distribution, but Tbx15LacZ / Tbx15LacZ homozygotes were noted to exhibit reduced body size and an abnormal craniofacial appearance identical to that caused by deH.

We generated Tbx15LacZ / deH compound heterozygotes; on an Aw / at background, these animals exhibited the same abnormal restriction of dorsal pigmentation at P3. 5 and expanded yellow flank area as described above for deH / deH animals ( see Figure 2).	"animals	85	92	Organism"	"animals	229	236	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 229, ""end_span"": 236, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These observations demonstrate that the pigmentary and craniofacial characteristics of deH are caused by loss of function for Tbx15.	"pigmentary	40	50	Chemical"	"Tbx15	126	131	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""pigmentary"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""Tbx15"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

In P3. 5 skin, Tbx15 is expressed in both dorsal and ventral skin, most strongly in the condensed upper dermis and developing dermal sheaths of hair follicles; faint expression can also be detected in rare dermal papillae cells ( Figure 4B).	"Tbx15	15	20	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"dermal papillae cells	206	227	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Tbx15"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""dermal papillae cells"", ""start_span"": 206, ""end_span"": 227, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The junction between expression domains is indistinct, and by E14. 5, Tbx15 expression extends ventrally and overlaps extensively with Agouti expression ( Figure 5C and 5D).	"Tbx15	70	75	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Agouti	135	141	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Tbx15"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Agouti"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We also examined the effect of deH on expression of Agouti and found no difference between mutant and nonmutant at E12. 5 or E13. 5 ( data not shown).	"Agouti	52	58	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutant	91	97	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Agouti"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
We evaluated the embryonic skin fragments for their potential to give rise to different hair colors and for their expression of Tbx15 and Agouti.

However, in parallel preparations from at / at mice, the ventral pheomelanin domain represents 47% of the total skin circumference; therefore, the proportions of total skin circumference occupied by dorsal eumelanin and somite - derived dermis are 53% and 37%, respectively ( Figure 8B).	"mice	47	51	Organism"	"eumelanin	206	215	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""eumelanin"", ""start_span"": 206, ""end_span"": 215, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Finally, a Tbx15 targeted allele has the same phenotype as deH.	"Tbx15	11	16	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"allele	26	32	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Tbx15"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""allele"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Our results suggest that patterned expression of Tbx15 provides an instructional cue required to establish the future identity of dorsal dermis with regard to pigmentary and hair length patterning.	"Tbx15	49	54	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"pigmentary	159	169	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Tbx15"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""pigmentary"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 169, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
These findings represent a novel role for T - box gene action in embryonic development and provide evidence for a previously unappreciated complexity to acquisition of dorsoventral positional identity in mammalian skin.

Indeed, slight differences between the regions of transition for pigment - type switching and pigment content give rise to a subtle yellow stripe along the flank ( see Figures 1, 2, and 9A).

However, it would not be surprising to find some degree of functional redundancy in animals mutated for two or three of the subfamily members in other body regions, particularly the limbs and the head.

Despite high levels of Tbx22 expression in periocular embryonic mesenchyme ( Braybrook et al. 2002; Bush et al. 2002; Herr et al. 2003), the condition does not affect the eye, perhaps because residual activity is provided by Tbx15 in the same region.

Cell lineage studies should provide a definitive answer, but we favor the latter hypothesis, because measurements of dorsoventral regions according to hair color in deH / deH mice revealed a small increase of the cream - colored ventral region in addition to the approximate doubling of the yellow flank region ( see Figure 2).

However, neither normal patterns of pigment - type synthesis in the limb nor their disruption in deH / deH mice correspond to obvious developmental compartments.

In the case of Lmx1b, its expression in the distal limb depends on Wnt7a produced in the overlying dorsal ectoderm ( Riddle et al. 1995; Cygan et al. 1997; Loomis et al. 1998).

Wnt7a, in turn, is restricted to dorsal ectoderm by En1 in the ventral ectoderm ( Loomis et al. 1996; Cygan et al. 1997; Logan et al. 1997), whose expression marks a lineage boundary coincident with the dorsoventral midline of the apical ectodermal ridge ( Altabef et al. 1997; Michaud et al. 1997; Kimmel et al. 2000).

Because the ventral limit of Tbx15 expression corresponds to the dorsal limit of En1 expression and because the normal position of the pigmentation boundary lies approximately in register with the limb - bud outgrowths, we depict the position of a putative dorsoventral boundary in trunk ectoderm as coincident with the limb dorsoventral boundary.

It is possible that Tbx15 influences skin patterning in a very narrow window of development; alternatively, establishment of dorsal identity by Tbx15 may require another as - yet - unidentified factor that is only present in the mesenchyme underlying dorsal ectoderm.

At E20. 5, the distal lung of wild type embryos consisted of saccular structures lined by flat type I AECs, and by cuboidal surfactant - producing type II AECs ( Fig. 7A).

Decreased immunostaining for AQP5, another type I AEC marker, was also noted in Dhcr7 deficient lungs at E20. 5, compared to control lungs ( Fig. 7, cf. panels E and F).

Megalin was highly expressed on the distal epithelium at E20. 5 from wild - type lungs, as well as type I AECs lining the developed saccules ( Fig. 7G).

In contrast, though megalin staining was detected in developing saccules in knockout embryonic lungs, its expression was confined to undifferentiated cuboidal cells ( Fig. 7H), further indicating a delay in type I AECs differentiation in the knockout lungs.

At E14. 5, both the epithelium and mesenchyme were negative for cav - 1 alpha staining, and cav - 1 alpha was detected in the developing blood vessels and capillaries, with no differences observed between wild - type and Dhcr7 - / - lungs ( Fig. 8, panels A and B).

At E20. 5, cav - 1 alpha stained cells in knockout lungs were embedded in a relatively thick mesenchyme surrounding undeveloped epithelial tubules, and these epithelial cells remained cuboidal, instead of flattening out ( Fig. 8, panel F).

Likewise, examination of lung sections from increasing gestational ages through to birth showed no significant differences between wild - type and Dhcr7 deficient tissues.

The patterns of staining observed were comparable to those previously reported for Shh in mouse lungs [ 25].

Shh staining was restricted to epithelial cells in the distal region of the primordial tubes of lungs at E13. 5 and E15. 5.

Note that proximal epithelial cells of primordial tubes were not immunostained for Shh ( E and F, arrows).

Shh was detected in the lung epithelial cells on E18. 5, and mainly in the conducting airways in the neonates.

Immunostaining of Ptch from E13. 5 to P 0 confirmed concordance with Shh expression and was not significantly different between wild - type and knockout embryos.

More importantly, no band corresponding to a full - length Shh ( ~ 45 kD) was present in the lung lysates from the knockout embryos, suggesting that processing of Shh was not impaired.

The elucidation that SLOS is caused by a defect in an enzyme necessary for cholesterol biosynthesis has improved our understanding of embryonic development.

Although cardiac abnormalities are common in human SLOS [ 36], no structural abnormalities of the heart or the great vessels were observed in the Dhcr7 - / - pups.

In support of normal differentiation of type II AECs, no alteration in the gene expression patterns for surfactant proteins A, B, C or D was noted, nor was the pattern of distribution of SP - C altered in lungs from knockout embryos.

We showed here that body length was significantly reduced at later stages of gestation in Dhcr7 - / - animals, compared to controls.

Interestingly, the lower lung / body ratios at E18. 5 in Dhcr7 - / - embryos compared to wild - type suggested a disproportionate inhibition of lung growth than other organs.

These results, as well as this study, suggest that a considerable amount of maternal cholesterol can be transferred to the murine fetus.

Although a mechanistic understanding of why a deficiency in cholesterol biosynthesis leads to abnormal embryonic development is lacking, a frequently advanced explanation has been that Shh signaling, involved in early developmental patterning, may be disrupted.

In this study, the lack of evidence of abnormal lung branching morphogenesis in the early stages, but a consistent delayed maturation of the gas - exchange region of the lung in the saccular period of development of Dhcr7 - / - embryos was observed, suggesting early Shh signaling was normal.

Additionally, although these experiments were not quantitative, the abundance of Shh appeared unchanged between these genotypes.

Shh signaling leads to the activation of transcription and increased protein levels of these components [ 40 - 42].

If Shh signaling were defective in Dhcr7 - / - embryos, these could have resulted in abnormalities of the staining patterns of these components, but no such disturbance was detected.	"Shh	3	6	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Dhcr7	35	40	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Shh"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 6, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Dhcr7"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Indeed, the patterns of protein expression seemed comparable and indistinguishable from wild - type embryos at all stages of lung development examined.

However, a deficiency in their ability to respond to Shh activation, as judged by reporter gene expression, was demonstrable.

In the present study, we did not detect unprocessed Shh in Dhcr7 - / - embryonic tissues at E11. 5.

In addition, the dopamine D2 receptor deficient mice repeatedly fail to alter their response patterns during reversal trials where the reinforcement rules were inverted.

Inbred C57Bl / 6J mice that develop in the complete absence of functional dopamine D2 receptors are capable of olfaction but display an impaired ability to acquire odor - driven reinforcement contingencies.

Furthermore, the ability of dopamine D2 receptor deficient mice to adjust their responding to a previously reinforced stimulus when unexpected outcomes are encountered is significantly impaired.

These findings suggest that signaling mediated by the dopamine D2 receptor is important for regulating associative and reversal learning and may have implications for the treatment of human attention disorders.

The first, unlearned stage is the organism ' s experience with a primary reinforcer that elicits some unlearned / innate physiological response ( e. g. palatability of a food or satiety).

The second phase involves the attachment of salience to external stimuli ( discriminative stimuli) that signal whether the delivery of a primary reinforcer will or will not occur based on some emitted behavior ( e. g. a rodent lever presses for food pellets only when a stimulus light is illuminated in an operant chamber).

Moreover, acute dosing does not recapitulate the marked learning deficits produced in rodents [ 15, 16] by chronic exposure to dopamine D2R antagonists [ 6, 7].

Reversal learning in rodents can serve as an index of learning adaptability and alertness that correlates with human attentional - shift paradigms [ 17, 18].

Additionally, a previous report demonstrated that excitotoxic lesions of terminal field targets of mesocortical dopamine have been shown to disrupt reversal learning [ 19].

Moreover an inverse relationship between lower dopamine D2R levels and compulsive behavior in human subjects has been reported [ 22].

None of the D2R - / - mice achieved the criterion of 80% accuracy by session 5.

Moreover, it has been reported that acute administration of the dopamine D2 / 3 antagonist, raclopride, actually improves acquisition of food - motivated associative learning [ 6].

Additionally, none of these studies addressed the observation that the effects of D2R antagonists on locomotion and learning depend on whether exposure is chronic or acute [ e. g. [ 15, 16]].

Consequently, our data, and data from other studies, suggest that the complete lack of D2Rs in the olfactory bulb does not prevent transduction of olfactory stimuli; rather it affects the ability to habituate, or tune, olfactory nerve activity associated with repeatedly encountered concentrations of chemical stimuli [ 32].	"D2Rs	87	91	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"chemical	301	309	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""D2Rs"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""chemical"", ""start_span"": 301, ""end_span"": 309, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
This manipulation would control the number of errors based on trials performed to determine if the apparent difference in absolute number of errors demonstrated by the mutant mice ( the putative performance deficit) is simply a reflection of extra trials.

Electrophysiological data further support the hypothesis that signaling mediated by dopamine D2Rs tunes D1R - mediated mesocorticolimbic output.	"dopamine D2Rs	84	97	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"D1R	104	107	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""dopamine D2Rs"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""D1R"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Indeed, perseverative behavior is associated with over activity of the dorsal striatum in rodents [ 36] and over activity of the caudate in patients with ADHD [ 37] and a strong inverse correlation of D2R binding with compulsive behavior has been reported [ 22].	"rodents	90	97	Organism"	"D2R	201	204	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""rodents"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""D2R"", ""start_span"": 201, ""end_span"": 204, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Importantly, our data indicate that the poor performances displayed by the D2R - / - mice are manifestations of reversal learning deficits and not gross motivational or sensory impairments.	"D2R	75	78	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mice	85	89	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""D2R"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We therefore argue that D2Rs participate in signaling or alerting the organism of learning contingency changes during reversal learning and sculpt ongoing goal - directed behavior.	"D2Rs	24	28	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"organism	70	78	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""D2Rs"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""organism"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, mice completely deficient in D2Rs demonstrated disrupted acquisition of discriminative stimulus relationships and an impaired ability to recognize changes in behavioral determinants.

Therefore, we suggest that during associative learning or when unexpected reinforcement outcomes are modified ( reversal learning) dopamine - driven reinforcement impulses involve signaling mediated by dopamine D2Rs.

There were two major patterns of cone gene derepression.	"cone	33	37	Cell"	"gene	38	42	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""gene"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Although numerous positive cells were present in the rd7 retina ( particularly in the ventral portion), there were clearly many interspersed cells that showed a complete absence of expression.	"cells	27	32	Cell"	"cells	141	146	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Novel Cone - Specific Genes Are Derepressed in rd7	"Cone	6	10	Cell"	"Genes	22	27	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Cone"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Genes"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
In most cases, the novel cone genes identified in this study appear to have a type I pattern of derepression.	"cone	25	29	Cell"	"genes	30	35	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
This result is particularly notable because Thrb2 is absolutely required for the expression of M - opsin [ 22].	"Thrb2	44	49	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"M - opsin	95	104	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Thrb2"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""M - opsin"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This finding is consistent with the normal expression pattern and function of Thrb2 in the rd7 mutant.

In addition, by P28, the M - opsin - positive cell bodies in rd7 appear to have relocated to their normal position at the scleral edge of the ONL ( Figure S8).	"M - opsin	25	34	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cell bodies	46	57	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""M - opsin"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cell bodies"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Rod Genes Are Only Modestly and Temporarily Affected in rd7	"Rod	0	3	Cell"	"Genes	4	9	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Rod"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Genes"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Microarray and in situ hybridization analysis of numerous rod genes failed to reveal marked changes in expression levels at P14 and P21 ( see Figure 2, lower left photomicrographs; Table S2).

Strikingly, Nr2e3 itself was markedly up - regulated in the rd7 mutant both by microarray and in situ hybridization ( see Figure 2, lower right photomicrographs; Table S2).	"Nr2e3	12	17	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutant	64	70	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Nr2e3"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
This gene showed a unique pattern of expression in the adult rd7 mutant retina.	"gene	5	9	Sequence"	"mutant	65	71	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""gene"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"

Our in situ hybridization data suggest that rhodopsin expression is markedly reduced at P6, but that it attains levels indistinguishable from wild - type by P14.	"rhodopsin	44	53	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"wild - type	142	153	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""rhodopsin"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""wild - type"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
The overall finding of modest reductions in rod - specific gene expression is entirely in keeping with the results of the present study.	"rod	44	47	Cell"	"gene	59	63	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""gene"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
It will be important to determine the extent to which the function of Nr2e3 has been conserved in the retina of such a distantly related organism.	"Nr2e3	70	75	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"organism	137	145	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Nr2e3"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""organism"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This information will be very useful for future bioinformatic analyses of Nr2e3 target genes.	"Nr2e3	74	79	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"genes	87	92	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""Nr2e3"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
In the case of type I genes, Nr2e3 is the primary repressor and transcription factor X is of secondary importance.	"genes	22	27	Sequence"	"Nr2e3	29	34	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Nr2e3"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In the case of type II genes, transcription factor X exerts the major repressive effect on transcription, and Nr2e3 plays a lesser, but still important role.	"genes	23	28	Sequence"	"Nr2e3	110	115	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""Nr2e3"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
An additional observation suggesting that M - opsin and S - opsin are controlled by different mechanisms comes from in vitro experiments [ 31, 32].	"M - opsin	42	51	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"S - opsin	56	65	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""M - opsin"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""S - opsin"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The factor ( s) controlling these differences are unknown, but may be intrinsic, as cocultures of older and younger retinas, conditioned media from older retinas, and addition of a variety of small molecules were unable to promote the expression of M - opsin in the P0 - initiated cultures [ 32].	"molecules	198	207	Chemical"	"M - opsin	249	258	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""molecules"", ""start_span"": 198, ""end_span"": 207, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""M - opsin"", ""start_span"": 249, ""end_span"": 258, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
[ 19] reported that M - opsin expression is mildly increased in the rd7 mutant retina.	"M - opsin	20	29	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutant	72	78	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""M - opsin"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
It is possible that a subtle increase in M - opsin transcript levels does occur in the rd7 retina, and that this difference could not be detected by in situ hybridization.	"M - opsin	41	50	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"transcript	51	61	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""M - opsin"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""transcript"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Interestingly, Pygm has been implicated in human disease.	"Pygm	15	19	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"human	43	48	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Pygm"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In fact, there is experimental evidence from the rat to support the conclusion that early - born and late - born rods are intrinsically different [ 37].	"rat	49	52	Organism"	"rods	113	117	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rat"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""rods"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Of course, if this were not the case, this experiment could not rule out the possibility that molecularly distinct populations of rod precursors are present simultaneously in the developing retina.	"molecularly	94	105	Chemical"	"rod	130	133	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""molecularly"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In this way, a subset of cells from an initially homogeneous population would select the S - cone fate in an entirely probabilistic manner.	"cells	25	30	Cell"	"cone	93	97	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The rd7 mutant mice also demonstrate the latter two defects, but have a normal ERG [ 15, 45].	"mutant	8	14	Sequence"	"mice	15	19	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The fact that the rd7 mouse has a normal ERG strongly suggests that the aberrant ERG in ESCS is not attributable to the activity of a hybrid photoreceptor identical to that found in this study.	"mouse	22	27	Organism"	"photoreceptor	141	154	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
As discussed above, this ratio could depend either on the relative percentages of two distinct rod precursor populations or on stochastic effects on regulatory gene expression.	"rod	95	98	Cell"	"gene	160	164	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""gene"", ""start_span"": 160, ""end_span"": 164, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
The cause of this abnormality is not known, but it is possibly related to defects in photoreceptor cell polarity in the rd7 mutant.	"photoreceptor cell	85	103	Cell"	"mutant	124	130	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptor cell"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"
Although we were unable to confirm this finding by in situ hybridization due to the weakness of the signal, it is possible that the up - regulation of crumbs in the retina is the cause of the lamination defects seen in the rd7 mutant.	"crumbs	151	157	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mutant	227	233	Sequence"	"[{""token"": ""crumbs"", ""start_span"": 151, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 227, ""end_span"": 233, ""type"": ""Sequence""}]"

It is interesting to note that in these mouse lines only ~ 5 - 6% of normal BCKDH activity in the liver was sufficient to allow survival.

ATRX has been shown to remodel chromatin [ 8].	"ATRX	0	4	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"chromatin	31	40	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""ATRX"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""chromatin"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Furthermore, disruption of ATRX leads to diverse changes in DNA methylation [ 11].

Nevertheless, the role ATRX plays in gene expression remains unclear.

Thus, a conditional knockout strategy allowed the isolation of ES cells that are null for full - length Atrx.

Atrxnull ES cells could be maintained in culture but were generally slower growing than Atrx + ES clones, and appeared to undergo higher rates of spontaneous differentiation.	"cells	12	17	Cell"	"Atrx	88	92	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Atrx"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In a control competition experiment between different clones bearing functional Atrx alleles ( AtrxWT and Atrxflox), both clones continued to be equally represented after 8 d of cocultivation.

We also specifically quantitated the mitotic index within each population by flow cytometry after staining ES cells for phosphorylated ( Ser10) histone H3, a specific marker of mitosis ( Figure S1B) [ 13].

Two independently targeted Atrxflox ES cell clones with normal male karyotype were injected into C57BL / 6 blastocysts to produce chimaeric mice, which were then used to obtain germline transmission.

Males hemizygous and females heterozygous or homozygous for the Atrxflox allele were viable, appeared healthy, and bred normally, suggesting that, as expected, the Atrxflox allele was functionally normal.

Widespread expression of the GATA1 - cre transgene has been demonstrated during early embryogenesis [ 14].

This finding was unexpected, since human ATR - X patients clearly survive to adulthood ( see Discussion).

Thus the absence of Atrx gives rise to embryonic lethality in mice before 9. 5 dpc.

To investigate the morphology of Atrxnull embryos prior to death, embryos from the above crosses were initially dissected in their deciduas at 7. 5 dpc, and paraffin sections were stained with haematoxylin ( Figure 5A) or with an anti - ATRX antibody ( Figure 5B - 5E).

Immunohistochemical staining revealed that Atrx was widely expressed in wild - type 7. 5 dpc embryos ( Figure 5B).

The head fold had clearly formed, and expression of the early mesoderm marker brachyury ( T) [ 16] was detected in the primitive streak and emerging notochord by whole - mount in situ hybridisation ( WMISH) ( Figure 5F), indicating that Atrxnull embryos had gastrulated.

To investigate whether the reduced size of the Atrxnull embryos was due to an increase in apoptosis, we analysed sections of paraffin - embedded 7. 5 dpc embryos by TdT - mediated dUTP nick end labeling ( TUNEL) assay ( Figure 6A).	"TdT	165	168	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"dUTP	180	184	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""TdT"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 168, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""dUTP"", ""start_span"": 180, ""end_span"": 184, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Very few apoptotic cells were detected in wild - type 7. 5 dpc embryos.

However, consistent with our observation of a grossly normal apoptotic index in Atrxnull ES cells ( Figure S2), the apoptotic response observed in Atrxnull embryos was also not uniform, but was restricted to a low number of scattered TUNEL - positive cells.	"cells	92	97	Cell"	"cells	251	256	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 251, ""end_span"": 256, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Relative to the very high mitotic index observed in wild - type embryos, the proportion of mitotic cells observed in Atrxnull embryos at 7. 5 dpc was dramatically reduced ( Figure 6B).

These observations suggest that the mitotic defect observed in embryos is unlikely to be a direct, cell - autonomous effect of the absence of Atrx, and is more likely to be a secondary effect resulting from the failure to develop a normal trophoblast ( see below).	"cell	99	103	Cell"	"Atrx	142	146	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Atrx"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
After 5 d, individual blastocyst cultures were scored for the extent of primary trophoblast outgrowth, and the Atrx genotype and sex of the blastocyst were determined by PCR.

Most blastocysts hatched from the zona pellucida within 24 h, and trophoblast cells spreading out from the inner cell mass could usually be detected within 48 h of culture.

For all AtrxWT / null carrier female embryos presented in Table 1, the AtrxWT allele was paternally derived, while the Atrxnull allele was maternally derived.

As described above, Atrx expression was detected in every cell in the epiblast ( embryo proper) region of wild - type 7. 5 dpc embryos ( Figure 8B).

TGCs are highly differentiated, postmitotic cells that ultimately form an epithelial layer at the periphery of the placenta, which interfaces with the maternal cells of the decidua [ 23].

Indeed, we show that Atrx is highly expressed throughout the entire developing embryo at 7. 5 dpc ( Figure 5B), and it is likely that Atrx function will turn out to be important for other differentiating tissues.

Hand1 is required for terminal differentiation of secondary TGCs, and in its absence trophoblast cells arrest at a precursor stage in the ectoplacental cone [ 17, 28].

Further, it has been shown that in a subpopulation of extraembryonic cells, it is the Xm rather than the Xp that undergoes late replication, a molecular correlate of the inactive state [ 18, 36].

A total of 25 pups were born from three litters, of which 7 ( 28%) were confirmed to be K14 - cre; ApcCKO / CKO by genotyping, indicating that KA mutants were born in the expected Mendelian ratio.

Taken together, these features could account for the apparently delayed, followed by outgrowth, of the short and shaggy - looking fur coat of these mutant mice.

Apc is a regulator of beta - catenin that is important for Wnt signaling.

The aberrant hair follicle morphogenesis is evident as early as E14. 5 in mutant embryonic skin, by multiple apolarized expression of Shh throughout the epidermis ( Figure 5B), whereas that of control embryos was well polarized and regularly spaced ( Figure 5A).

With development, control mouse hair follicles invaginate downward in a polarized manner ( Figure 5C), whereas those of mutant embryos were completely irregular and apolarized ( Figure 5D).

The aberrant initiation of multiple hair placodes during early hair follicle morphogenesis was also evident by the whole - mount in situ hybridization ( ISH) of E15. 5 mutant embryos for beta - catenin ( Figure 5F and 5F ').	"mutant	168	174	Sequence"	"beta - catenin	187	201	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""mutant"", ""start_span"": 168, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Sequence""}, {""token"": ""beta - catenin"", ""start_span"": 187, ""end_span"": 201, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The expression pattern of beta - catenin in embryos clearly demonstrated the formation of regular arrays of hair placodes in the normal embryonic skin ( Figure 5E and 5E '), but such regular patterning was lost, and often tightly clustered abnormal hair placodes were initiated in mutant embryonic skin ( Figure 5F ').

These results collectively suggest that the terminal differentiation does take place normally in the mutant skin, but initiation of embryonic hair follicle morphogenesis is severely disrupted, accompanied by a continuous ectopic hair follicle morphogenesis in postnatal mutant skin.

Similar to the biology of hair follicles, K14 - cre - driven loss of Apc also affected the development of other epidermal appendages that depend on epithelial - mesenchymal interactions for their formation.

The thymus was made of two lobules as in the normal mice but the mutant thymus was significantly smaller in size than that of the age - matched controls ( Figure 2G).

A P3 KA mutant pup that showed milder phenotype with a comparable body weight to its normal littermates ( Figure 2A, M2) showed milder thymus abnormalities ( Figure 6E) compared to its more severe mutant littermate ( Figure 2A, M1; Figure 6H).

Most notably, the K14 and beta - catenin staining patterns were mutually exclusive ( Figure 6J and 6K).

There were numerous neutrophils and macrophages infiltrating the thymus in response to these keratins; hence, these structures could be called pyogranuloma.

Stabilization of beta - catenin in a broader population of cells could account for some of the phenotypic differences.

( 3) We cannot exclude the possibility that given the multifunctional properties of Apc, disruption of its functions other than down - regulation of beta - catenin may also have contributed to the observed overt phenotype.

In addition to aberrant hair follicle morphogenesis, K14 - driven loss of Apc caused formation of multiple tooth buds that, like hair follicles, were known to develop through inductive interactions between the epithelium and mesenchyme.

It should be noted that although multiple tooth buds were histologically visible ( Figure 4O and 4P), these teeth never broke out and the KA mutant mice appeared toothless.

In agreement with the previous results, in P3 normal thymus K14 expression was restricted to stellate medullary TECs ( Figure 6D), whereas K8 expression was found throughout the TECs ( unpublished data).
