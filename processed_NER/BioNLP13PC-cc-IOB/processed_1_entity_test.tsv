However, the phosphorylated factor showed a marked reduction in the second - order rate constant, suggesting that the phosphorylation interfered with ribosome. eEF - 2 complex formation by reducing the affinity of eEF - 2 for the ribosome.

NF - kappa B is a heterodimer of 50 - and 65 - kDa subunits sequestered in the cytoplasm complexed to inhibitory protein I kappa B.	"cytoplasm	79	88	Cellular_component"	"[{""token"": ""cytoplasm"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}]"
Following stimulation of cells, I kappa B dissociates from NF - kappa B, allowing its translocation to the nucleus, where it carries out the transactivation function.

We demonstrate here that overexpression of zeta PKC is by itself sufficient to stimulate a permanent translocation of functionally active NF - kappa B into the nucleus of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and that transfection of a kinase - defective dominant negative mutant of zeta PKC dramatically inhibits the kappa B - dependent transactivation of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter plasmid in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts.

In transfected cells, DP - 1 did not accumulate in the nucleus unless it was coexpressed with the heterodimeric partners E2F - 1, E2F - 2, or E2F - 3.	"nucleus	55	62	Cellular_component"	"[{""token"": ""nucleus"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}]"
Domain mapping experiments showed that regions of E2F - 1 and DP - 1 that are required for stable association of the two proteins were also required for nuclear localization of DP - 1.
