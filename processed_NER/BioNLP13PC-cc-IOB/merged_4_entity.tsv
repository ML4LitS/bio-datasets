The budding yeast spindle pole body ( SPB) not only organizes the astral and nuclear microtubules but is also associated with a number of cell - cycle regulators that control mitotic exit.	spindle pole body,18,35,Cellular_component	SPB,38,41,Cellular_component	astral,66,72,Cellular_component	nuclear microtubules,77,97,Cellular_component	"[{""token"": ""spindle pole body"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""SPB"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""astral"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""nuclear microtubules"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}]"	train
Our observations demonstrate that Mad2p localization at NPCs is sensitive to nuclear levels of Ran and suggest that release of Mad2p from NPCs is closely linked with spindle assembly checkpoint activation in yeast.

These functions correlate with its ability to localize to and disrupt centromeres and specific subnuclear structures known as ND10, PML nuclear bodies, or promyelocytic oncogenic domains.	centromeres,70,81,Cellular_component	ND10,126,130,Cellular_component	PML nuclear bodies,132,150,Cellular_component	promyelocytic oncogenic domains,155,186,Cellular_component	"[{""token"": ""centromeres"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""ND10"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""PML nuclear bodies"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""promyelocytic oncogenic domains"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 186, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}]"	valid
p130 was observed to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm in a heterokaryon fusion assay, suggesting the presence of nuclear and cytoplasmic localization signals.	nucleus,41,48,Cellular_component	cytoplasm,53,62,Cellular_component	nuclear,122,129,Cellular_component	cytoplasmic,134,145,Cellular_component	"[{""token"": ""nucleus"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""cytoplasm"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""cytoplasmic"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}]"	valid
The spindle checkpoint is a surveillance mechanism that ensures high fidelity of chromosome segregation by inhibiting anaphase until all kinetochores have established bipolar attachments to spindle microtubules.	spindle,4,11,Cellular_component	chromosome,81,91,Cellular_component	kinetochores,137,149,Cellular_component	spindle microtubules,190,210,Cellular_component	"[{""token"": ""spindle"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""chromosome"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""kinetochores"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""spindle microtubules"", ""start_span"": 190, ""end_span"": 210, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}]"	test
We show that despite being able to arrest in response to microtubule depolymerisation and kinetochore - microtubule attachment defects, bub1DeltaK cells are sensitive to microtubule drugs.	microtubule,57,68,Cellular_component	kinetochore,90,101,Cellular_component	microtubule,104,115,Cellular_component	microtubule,170,181,Cellular_component	"[{""token"": ""microtubule"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""kinetochore"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""microtubule"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""microtubule"", ""start_span"": 170, ""end_span"": 181, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}]"	test
We show here that the previously characterized cytoplasmic retention sequence of Cyclin B1, responsible for its interphase cytoplasmic localization, is actually an autonomous nuclear export sequence, capable of directing nuclear export of a heterologous protein, and able to bind specifically to the recently identified export mediator, CRM1.	cytoplasmic,47,58,Cellular_component	cytoplasmic,123,134,Cellular_component	nuclear,175,182,Cellular_component	nuclear,221,228,Cellular_component	"[{""token"": ""cytoplasmic"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""cytoplasmic"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 182, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 221, ""end_span"": 228, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}]"	test
