In contrast, a lysosomal enzyme preparation from a human fibroblast cell line deficient in idurono - 2 - sulfatase ( Hunter ' s - syndrome), which had no activity on the IdoA ( 2 - SO4) - [ 3H] AManR ( 6 - SO4), converted GlcA ( 2 - SO4) - [ 3H] AManR ( 6 - SO4) to a mixture of GlcA - [ 3H] AManR ( 6 - SO4) and [ 3H] AManR ( 6 - SO4).

Microsomal arylacetamide deacetylase ( DAC) competes against the activity of cytosolic arylamine N - acetyltransferase, which catalyzes one of the initial biotransformation pathways for arylamine and heterocyclic amine carcinogens in many species and tissues.	"cytosolic	77	86	Cellular_component"	"[{""token"": ""cytosolic"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}]"
These findings demonstrate that there is a cytosolic pathway for folding tubulin and actin in vivo that involves the TCP1 complex.	"cytosolic	43	52	Cellular_component"	"[{""token"": ""cytosolic"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}]"
The NF - kappa B precursor p105 and the proto - oncogene product Bcl - 3 are I kappa B molecules and control nuclear translocation of NF - kappa B.	"nuclear	109	116	Cellular_component"	"[{""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}]"
Similar to an I kappa B molecule, p105 associates in the cytoplasm with p50 or p65.	"cytoplasm	57	66	Cellular_component"	"[{""token"": ""cytoplasm"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}]"
Through this assembly, p105 efficiently blocks nuclear transfer of either subunit.	"nuclear	47	54	Cellular_component"	"[{""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}]"
The proto - oncogene product Bcl - 3 also controls nuclear translocation of p50, but not of p65.	"nuclear	51	58	Cellular_component"	"[{""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}]"
Hence, p50 can be retained in the cytoplasm via at least three distinct interactions: through direct interactions either with its own precursor, with Bcl - 3 or indirectly through I kappa B alpha or - beta when attached to p65.

Biochemical analysis reveals that protein kinase C autophosphorylates on S660, that autophosphorylation on S660 follows T641 autophosphorylation, that autophosphorylation on S660 is accompanied by the release of protein kinase C into the cytosol, and that T500 is not an autophosphorylation site.

Cytosolic phospholipase A2 ( cPLA2) is a calcium - sensitive 85 - kDa enzyme that hydrolyzes arachidonic acid - containing membrane phospholipids to initiate the biosynthesis of eicosanoids and platelet - activating factor, potent inflammatory mediators.
