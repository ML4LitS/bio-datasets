The lack of importance of PLD1 signaling in RhoA - mediated cytoskeletal reorganization is further supported by the observation that PLD1 depletion using an shRNA approach and tetracycline - induced overexpression of the wild - type and the catalytically inactive mutant of PLD1 in stable cell lines do not alter stress fiber and focal adhesion formation.
