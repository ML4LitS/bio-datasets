By use of phosphatase inhibitors and a type 1 protein phosphatase mutant ( glc7 - 10), we show that the microtubule binding activity, but not the centromeric DNA - binding activity, of the kinetochore complex is regulated by a balance between a protein kinase and the type 1 protein phosphatase ( PP1) encoded by the GLC7 gene.

glc7 - 10 mutant cells exhibit low kinetochore - microtubule binding activity in vitro and a high frequency of chromosome loss in vivo.

Here we show that SCF ( Cdc4) ubiquitylates Far1 in the nucleus, which in turn targets the multi - ubiquitylated protein to 26S proteasomes most likely located at the nuclear envelope.

The core SCF subunits Cdc53, Hrt1 and Skp1 were distributed in the nucleus and the cytoplasm, whereas the F - box protein Cdc4 was exclusively nuclear.

We found that NT2 cells, a neuronally committed human teratocarcinoma cell line, have abnormal ND10 characterized by low expression of the major ND10 component PML and no detectable expression of another major ND10 antigen, Sp100.

Phosphorylation of the chromosomal passenger protein Bir1 is required for localization of Ndc10 to the spindle during anaphase and full spindle elongation.

The middle region is not essential but is required to localize the inner kinetochore protein Ndc10 to the spindle during anaphase and to the midzone at telophase.

Mdr2 expression in SVs caused a time - and temperature - dependent enhancement of PC translocation to the inner leaflet of the membrane.
