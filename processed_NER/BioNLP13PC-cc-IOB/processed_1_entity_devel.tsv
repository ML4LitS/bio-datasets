The results indicated that treatment with oroxylin A inhibited NF - kappaB p65 nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha and IKKalpha / beta in both human colon tumor HCT116 cells and human monocytes THP - 1 cells.

Crystal structures of mitochondrial aconitase with alpha - methylisocitrate and with sulfate bound have been solved and refined at 2. 0 A resolution with R factors of 18. 2 and 16. 8%, respectively.

Cloning, expression, purification, and characterization of the human broad specificity lysosomal acid alpha - mannosidase.	"lysosomal	87	96	Cellular_component"	"[{""token"": ""lysosomal"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}]"
We have cloned and expressed two cDNAs encoding the human lysosomal alpha - mannosidase ( EC 3. 2. 1. 24) by RT - PCR of human spleen mRNA.	"lysosomal	58	67	Cellular_component"	"[{""token"": ""lysosomal"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}]"
Antiserum raised to the recombinant product of the 3 - kb alpha - mannosidase cDNA immunoprecipitated lysosomal alpha - mannosidase activity from human fibroblast extracts.

A novel p53 - inducible gene, PAG608, encodes a nuclear zinc finger protein whose overexpression promotes apoptosis.	"nuclear	48	55	Cellular_component"	"[{""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}]"
Transient overexpression of PAG608 in human tumor - derived cells leads to distinctive changes in nuclear morphology, and can promote apoptosis.	"nuclear	98	105	Cellular_component"	"[{""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}]"
Organic anion transporting polypeptide ( oatp) is an integral membrane protein cloned from rat liver that mediates Na + - independent transport of organic anions such as sulfobromophthalein and taurocholic acid.

Monolayers grown on glass coverslips were loaded with the pH - sensitive dye 2 ', 7 ' - bis ( carboxyethyl) - 5 ( 6) - carboxyfluorescein; intracellular pH ( pHi) was measured by excitation ratio fluorometry.

In the absence of extracellular Cl - and taurocholate, isohydric reduction of superfusate HCO3 - concentration from 50 to 25 mM resulted in an insignificant change in pHi over time ( dpHi / dt) in both groups.

We show here that TPP - - > TMP conversion can take place in rat liver mitochondria.	"mitochondria	71	83	Cellular_component"	"[{""token"": ""mitochondria"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}]"
Additional evidence is given that externally added TMP can cross the mitochondrial membrane in a manner consistent with the occurrence of a carrier - mediated process.
