Here we report that overproduction of either kinase - active or kinase - inactive forms of Myt1 blocked the nuclear - cytoplasmic shuttling of cyclin B1 and caused cells to delay in the G2 phase of the cell cycle.

Post - translational acetylation of histone H4 N - terminal tail in chromatin has been associated with several nuclear processes including transcription.

In response to extracellular stimuli, mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK, also known as ERK) translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus.

MAP kinase kinase ( MAPKK, also know as MEK), which possesses a nuclear export signal ( NES), acts as a cytoplasmic anchor of MAPK.

Nuclear import of wild - type MAPK ( mol. wt 42 kDa) was induced by activation of the MAPK pathway even in the presence of wheat germ agglutinin or dominant - negative Ran, whereas nuclear import of beta - galactosidase ( beta - gal) - fused MAPK ( mol. wt 160 kDa), which occurred in response to stimuli, was completely blocked by these inhibitors.

Moreover, while a dimerization - deficient mutant of MAPK was able to translocate to the nucleus upon stimulation, this mutant MAPK, when fused to beta - gal, became unable to enter the nucleus.

The stability of the protein is greatly reduced in a mutant that is constitutively localised to the nucleus, but is restored in a deletion derivative which remains in the cytoplasm.

Many cell surface proteins are anchored to the membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI) moiety, which is attached to the C terminus of the proteins.

Cells overexpressing a non - degradable Far1 were unable to polarize their actin cytoskeleton because they failed to relocate Cdc24 to the incipient bud site.

This mechanism ensures that Cdc24 is targeted to the site of receptor - associated heterotrimeric G - protein activation at the plasma membrane, thereby allowing polarization of the actin cytoskeleton along the morphogenetic gradient of pheromone.

NF - kappaB is normally sequestered in the cytoplasm of nonstimulated cells and consequently must be translocated into the nucleus to function.

The subcellular location of NF - kappaB is controlled by a family of inhibitory proteins, IkappaBs, which bind NF - kappaB and mask its nuclear localization signal, thereby preventing nuclear uptake.

Exposure of cells to a variety of extracellular stimuli leads to the rapid phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and ultimately proteolytic degradation of IkappaB, which frees NF - kappaB to translocate to the nucleus where it regulates gene transcription.

This function of Nud1p is distinct from its role in cell - cycle control: Nud1p binds the spindle checkpoint control proteins Bfa1p and Bub2p to the SPB, and is part of the mitotic exit network ( MEN) in which it functions upstream of CDC15 but downstream of LTE1.

Sites of Mps1p phosphorylation and Ser ( 36) are located within the N - terminal globular domain of Spc110p, which resides at the inner plaque of the SPB and binds the Tub4p complex.

A mutant of Cdc25C that is unable to bind 14 - 3 - 3 was partially nuclear in the absence of LMB and its nuclear accumulation was greatly enhanced by LMB - treatment.

These findings suggest that the nuclear export of Cdc25C is mediated by an intrinsic NES and that 14 - 3 - 3 binding negatively regulates nuclear import.

Kip1p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a bipolar kinesin in the conserved bimC kinesin subfamily that mediates mitotic spindle - pole separation.

The timing of degradation suggests that Kip1p functions primarily during spindle assembly and metaphase, and that Kip1p degradation facilitates structural changes in the mitotic spindle as anaphase progresses.

These results also show propionyl - CoA must be formed during the metabolism of alpha - ketoisovalerate and that extra - mitochondrial free carnitine rapidly interacts with matrix short - chain aliphatic acyl - CoA generated from alpha - keto acids of branched - chain amino acids and pyruvate in the presence and absence of malate.

The gene encoding p15 is located on chromosome 9 adjacent to the p16 gene at a frequent site of chromosomal abnormality in human tumours ( 9p21).

A role in folding newly translated cytoskeletal proteins in the cytosol of eukaryotes has been proposed for t - complex polypeptide 1 ( TCP1).

The calcium - dependent activation of the enzyme is mediated by an N - terminal C2 domain, which is responsible for calcium - dependent translocation of the enzyme to membranes and that enables the intact enzyme to hydrolyze membrane - resident substrates.

In the Erk MAP kinase pathway, activation of MAP kinases takes place in the cytoplasm and the activated enzyme moves to the nucleus.

Following phosphorylation of MAPKAP kinase - 2, nuclear p38 was exported to the cytoplasm in a complex with MAPKAP kinase - 2.
