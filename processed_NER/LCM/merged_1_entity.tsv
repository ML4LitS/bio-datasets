The indexed amplicons were purified and size selected using AMPure XP beads ( Beckman - Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) before sequencing on an Illumina Miseq ( Illumina) with the 600 cycle V3 chemistry ( 300 bp paired - end reads).	paired - end,204,216,Library_construction_method	"[{""token"": ""paired - end"", ""start_span"": 204, ""end_span"": 216, ""type"": ""Library_construction_method""}]"	train
For each sequenced library, adaptors were removed with Trimmomatic ( 97) v. 0. 27 ( parameters: ILLUMINACLIP:: 2: 40: 15) and paired - end reads were then joined with PANDAseq ( 98) v. 2. 4 ( parameters: - F 6 t 0. 32).	paired - end,126,138,Library_construction_method	"[{""token"": ""paired - end"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Library_construction_method""}]"	train
Single - end massively parallel pyrosequencing was carried out in multiplex on a 454 GS at the Sackler Institute for Comparative Genomics, American Museum of Natural History, New York, NY, USA.

Amplicons of expected length were confirmed on a 1% agarose gel, purified using the Agencourt AMPure XP magnetic bead system ( Beckman Coulter), and sequenced using the 300PE ( paired - end) MiSeq protocol at the Department of Biological Sciences, University of Calgary.	paired - end,177,189,Library_construction_method	"[{""token"": ""paired - end"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 189, ""type"": ""Library_construction_method""}]"	train
In details, denoising was performed through the following steps: ( i) merging together the forward and reverse reads using the PEAR Illumina paired - end read merger ( Zhang et al., 2014); ( ii) grouping reads ( having an average quality higher than 25) by using the USEARCH ( Edgar, 2010) algorithm ( prefix dereplication) into clusters ( 4% dissimilarity among sequences of the same cluster), so that each sequence of shorter length to the centroid sequence must be a 100% match to the centroid sequence for the length of the sequence; ( iv) Operational Taxonomic Unit ( OTU) selection by using the UPARSE OTU selection algorithm ( Edgar, 2013).	paired - end,141,153,Library_construction_method	"[{""token"": ""paired - end"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Library_construction_method""}]"	train
Scaffold integrity was validated via two independent indicators of scaffold integrity: ( i) level and uniformity of read depth in sub - regions and ( ii) mate - pair support.	mate - pair,154,165,Library_construction_method	"[{""token"": ""mate - pair"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 165, ""type"": ""Library_construction_method""}]"	train
Sequencing of the amplified V3V4 region libraries was performed using a MiSeq next - generation sequencer ( Illumina) with 2250 nt paired - end technology ( PE), using the v2 Illumina kit.	paired - end,131,143,Library_construction_method	"[{""token"": ""paired - end"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Library_construction_method""}]"	train
