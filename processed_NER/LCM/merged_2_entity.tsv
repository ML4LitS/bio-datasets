As expected, a large proportion of BGISEQ - 500 generated sequences; 95. 93% 98. 80% and 96. 47% 98. 61% for SE100 and PE50 reads, respectively, remained as high - quality reads.

Paired - end reads were then merged using FLASH ( Mago & Salzberg, 2011), imposing a minimum average length of 250 bases for each read, a minimum average length of 300 bases for paired read fragments, and a maximum fragment standard deviation of 30 bases.

Sequencing was conducted by IMGM Laboratories GmbH ( Martinsried, Germany) on an Illumina MiSeq platform using 2250bp paired - end ( PE) reads.	paired - end,118,130,Library_construction_method	PE,133,135,Library_construction_method	"[{""token"": ""paired - end"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Library_construction_method""}, {""token"": ""PE"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Library_construction_method""}]"	train
These differences included a four times increase in the duration of bead - beating and a sludge input volume of 50 l. Illumina TruSeq PCR free libraries and Nextera mate pair libraries were prepared according to the manufacturers protocol and paired - end sequenced ( 2 150 bp) on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform.	mate pair,165,174,Library_construction_method	paired - end,243,255,Library_construction_method	"[{""token"": ""mate pair"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Library_construction_method""}, {""token"": ""paired - end"", ""start_span"": 243, ""end_span"": 255, ""type"": ""Library_construction_method""}]"	train
