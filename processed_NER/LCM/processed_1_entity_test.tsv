Before processing them, we used PEAR64 to merge all the Illumina pair - end reads retrieved.	"pair - end	65	75	Library_construction_method"	"[{""token"": ""pair - end"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Library_construction_method""}]"
The MALASPINA datasets are from the 0. 2 to 0. 8m fraction and were sequenced using HiSeq2000 ( paired end reads of length 150bp).	"paired end	96	106	Library_construction_method"	"[{""token"": ""paired end"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Library_construction_method""}]"
Specifically, after fragmentation, paired end fragment library in length of170bp was constructed.	"paired end	35	45	Library_construction_method"	"[{""token"": ""paired end"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Library_construction_method""}]"
Paired - end sequencing with a 100 cycle Illumina HiSeq run generated partial ~ 30 bp overlaps, and six libraries were multiplexed per lane.	"Paired - end	0	12	Library_construction_method"	"[{""token"": ""Paired - end"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Library_construction_method""}]"
The overlapping paired - end reads were stitched together ( approximately 97bp overlap), and size selected to reduce non - specific amplification products from host DNA ( 225275bp).	"paired - end	16	28	Library_construction_method"	"[{""token"": ""paired - end"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Library_construction_method""}]"
Adaptor - appended fragments were sequenced on Illumina MiSeq desktop sequencer ( 2300bp paired - end run, San Diego, CA) according to standard protocols.	"paired - end	89	101	Library_construction_method"	"[{""token"": ""paired - end"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Library_construction_method""}]"
The samples ( 27 pooled and 4 individual replicates) were next individually barcoded and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform via the MiSeq Reagent Kit v2 ( 500 cycle), producing paired - end reads each 250 nucleotides in length.	"paired - end	186	198	Library_construction_method"	"[{""token"": ""paired - end"", ""start_span"": 186, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""Library_construction_method""}]"
