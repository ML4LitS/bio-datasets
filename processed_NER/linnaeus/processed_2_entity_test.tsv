As in men, the role of ACL IgG and LDL - cholesterol in influencing HOMA IR was negligible, but in contrast to men, hFABP might play a certain role in this process ( see Table 4D).

In non - hyperlipemic postmenopausal women the high concentration of serum leptin was not associated with higher insulin resistance: HOMA IR did not differ substantially from men.

In our non - hyperlipemic postmenopausal women the content of subcutaneous fat mass might be higher than in non - hyperlipemic men of appropriate age, which indicated a higher serum concentration of leptin.

In our study, insulin resistance in women seemed to be more notably than in men influenced by lipid disorders, i. e. positively by serum triglycerides and inversely by HDL - cholesterol.

Our results supported these findings unambiguously only in women, while in men TNF alpha seemed paradoxically to interfere with other factors - mainly BMI and leptin - in influencing insulin resistance, thus playing a quite different role.

Previously it was found [ 46] that correlation between serum TNF alpha on the one side, and insulin, HOMA IR, serum triglycerids, respectively, on the other side, was substantially more significant in women than in men.

Visceral obesity correlated with plasmatic aldosterone and with insulin resistance only in premenopausal women, but not in men [ 51].

From all these data we might support our above mentioned conclusion - that rising of insulin resistance in hyperlipemic women was associated with an increase of intra - abdominal fat, because this fat mass in particular is a source of TNF alpha, which interfered with insulin sensitivity only in women.	"women	120	125	Organism/Species"	"women	296	301	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""women"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""women"", ""start_span"": 296, ""end_span"": 301, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In postmenopausal women as well as in men of approximately equal age serum leptin plays a significant role as an important determinant of insulin resistance.

In addition to this factor, in women the grade of insulin resistance is very considerably influenced by serum triglycerides, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and by decreased concentration of HDL - cholesterol, while in men only a mild influence of BMI and decreased HDL - cholesterol is observed.

Two of three patients with rhupus who were negative for anti - CCP antibodies were also negative for anti - dsDNA antibodies, RF and anti - extractable nuclear antigen antibodies, although both patients met RA and SLE classification criteria, including ANA and erosive arthritis.

It was recently reported that bone marrow macrophages of integrin - beta 3 - deficient mice could not differentiate into mature osteoclasts in vitro, suggesting that alpha v beta 3 is involved not only in activation, but also in differentiation, of osteoclasts in mice [ 26, 27].

In mice, peripheral blood Ly - 6Chigh monocytes, which are thought to correspond to human CD16 - monocytes, increase in inflammatory conditions, and these cells are recruited into sites of inflammation [ 45].

The apparent rediscovery of the Ivory - billed Woodpecker Campephilus principalis in Arkansas, USA, previously feared extinct, was supported by video evidence of a single bird in flight ( Fitzpatrick et al, Science 2005, 308: 1460 - 1462).

The critical frames from the Arkansas video that were used to identify the bird as an Ivory - billed Woodpecker are shown to be equally, or more, compatible with the Pileated Woodpecker.

The similarities between the Arkansas bird and known Pileated Woodpeckers suggest that it was most likely a Pileated Woodpecker.

These plumage differences result in the Ivory - billed Woodpecker having a white trailing edge to the wings ( upper and lower sides), whereas the Pileated Woodpecker has a black trailing edge to the wings.

The wingbeat frequency of the bird in the Luneau video was measured at 8. 6 beats s - 1, similar to that inferred from archival sound recording of a single Ivory - billed Woodpecker, but claimed to be outside the range of Pileated Woodpeckers ( which generally have slower wingbeats) [ 1, 3].

On the other hand, the flight pattern of the bird in the Luneau video is asserted to be atypical for Pileated Woodpecker ( but matching anecdotal descriptions of Ivory - billed Woodpecker).

Independent analyses of the plumage patterns and wingbeat frequencies observable in Pileated Woodpeckers are presented, and it is concluded that the identification of the bird in the Luneau video as definite Ivory - billed Woodpecker is probably unsafe.

Four escape flights were captured that approximate to that recorded for the putative Ivory - billed Woodpecker Campephilus principalis by Luneau in April 2004 and published in Fitzpatrick et al [ 1].

The videos are not directly equivalent because the Pileated Woodpeckers made only short escape flights to nearby trees, whereas the putative Ivory - billed Woodpecker in the Luneau video showed little sign of coming to rest before being lost from view.

As shown in Tables 1 and 2, although the mean wingbeat frequencies of the Pileated Woodpeckers in DN ' s video are slower than the 8. 6 s - 1 recorded for the bird in the Luneau video [ 1, 3, 5] the first four wingbeats, the initial escape response, are faster than those claimed for Pileated Woodpeckers in the literature [ 1, 3, 5].	"Pileated Woodpeckers	74	94	Organism/Species"	"Pileated Woodpeckers	284	304	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Pileated Woodpeckers"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Pileated Woodpeckers"", ""start_span"": 284, ""end_span"": 304, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The 8. 6 beats s - 1 of the bird identified in the Luneau video, while consistent with the limited data ( n = 1; see Discussion) for Ivory - billed Woodpecker, is equally consistent with Pileated Woodpecker in its initial escape flight.

Comparisons of Pileated Woodpecker images with key images of Luneau video are shown in Figures 1 and 2, and suggest a genuine resemblance between the bird in the Luneau video and a Pileated Woodpecker.	"Pileated Woodpecker	15	34	Organism/Species"	"Pileated Woodpecker	181	200	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Pileated Woodpecker"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Pileated Woodpecker"", ""start_span"": 181, ""end_span"": 200, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
However, analysis of the bird in the Luneau video in light of images of known Pileated Woodpeckers confirms that a similar black trailing edge to the wing is discernable in some frames of the Luneau video ( compare Figure 1B, frame 775 with Figure 1A, frame 366. 7: the apparent plumage patterns are similar, and inconsistent with Ivory - billed Woodpecker).	"Pileated Woodpeckers	78	98	Organism/Species"	"Ivory - billed Woodpecker	331	356	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Pileated Woodpeckers"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Ivory - billed Woodpecker"", ""start_span"": 331, ""end_span"": 356, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
It is argued here that the hypothesis put forward in Sibley et al [ 4] is correct, and that the black trailing edge of the underwing of Pileated Woodpecker can indeed, due to flexion of the wings during the downstroke, be misinterpreted as the black leading edge and wingtips of the upperwing of an Ivory - billed Woodpecker.	"Pileated Woodpecker	136	155	Organism/Species"	"Ivory - billed Woodpecker	299	324	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Pileated Woodpecker"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 155, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Ivory - billed Woodpecker"", ""start_span"": 299, ""end_span"": 324, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The three plumage features described in Sibley et al [ 4] that are incompatible with Ivory - billed Woodpecker ( black secondary feathers on upper surface of left wing, brighter white primary bases, and a black band curling round the wing tip) are seen consistently in the Luneau video and are recapitulated throughout the video of Pileated Woodpecker.	"Ivory - billed Woodpecker	85	110	Organism/Species"	"Pileated Woodpecker	332	351	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Ivory - billed Woodpecker"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Pileated Woodpecker"", ""start_span"": 332, ""end_span"": 351, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Evidence is presented here to show that the distinctive plumage features of Pileated Woodpecker are surprisingly difficult to resolve in poor - quality video of birds in escape flight away from the camera, and that they can show apparent plumage patterns that might more readily be associated with Ivory - billed Woodpecker.	"Pileated Woodpecker	76	95	Organism/Species"	"Ivory - billed Woodpecker	298	323	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Pileated Woodpecker"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Ivory - billed Woodpecker"", ""start_span"": 298, ""end_span"": 323, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
It is, however, suggested here that critical frames used for identification of the Luneau video woodpecker as an Ivory - billed Woodpecker are also consistent with Pileated Woodpecker.	"Ivory - billed Woodpecker	113	138	Organism/Species"	"Pileated Woodpecker	164	183	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Ivory - billed Woodpecker"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Pileated Woodpecker"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 183, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The Luneau video as presented in Fitzpatrick et al [ 1], shows features that are consistent with Pileated Woodpecker, and inconsistent with Ivory - billed Woodpecker.

This analysis has shown that the hypothesis presented in Sibley et al [ 4] is plausible, i. e. that some of the frames interpreted by [ 1] to show the upperwing of an Ivory - billed Woodpecker may in fact show large amounts of white and the black trailing edge from the underwing of a Pileated Woodpecker.

Birds flap more rapidly at take off to gain altitude and speed than they do in sustained level flight: Pileated Woodpecker flight data in the literature [ 1, 4, 5] was derived from the work of Tobalske [ 8], which explicitly excluded the initial take - off period, and therefore cannot be used to support the elimination of Pileated Woodpecker in the Luneau video.

He was of the opinion that flight pattern was not a useful character for separating the two species in the field, and that Pileated Woodpeckers frequently fly in a manner that was in no way different to Ivory - billed Woodpeckers.

The dissection of a total genomic YAC library by this method may be more efficient than generating chromosome specific YAC libraries from somatic cell hybrids ( usually a haploid human chromosome on a diploid or greater rodent background) or flow - sorted chromosomes, because of the low transformation efficiency of yeast.

Although much of health behavior practice targets what people do rather than what they think, the logic of focusing on thoughts is that what people think about is the key to what they will do in the future, and that interventions that can measure and harness those processes will succeed to a greater extent than those that do not.
