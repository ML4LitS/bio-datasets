Scp160p is a 1222 amino acid Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein that contains 14 copies of the hnRNP K homology ( KH) domain, a highly conserved motif found in many proteins involved in RNA metabolism ( 1).

Deletion of the SCP160 locus in yeast is not lethal, but results in a complex phenotype, including increased DNA content per cell, missegregation of genetic markers during sporulation, and abnormal cell morphology, including increased size and irregular shape ( 4).

In brief, a 100 ml culture of yeast was grown in either YEPD or Hartwell synthetic medium, to early - log phase ( OD600 = 1. 0), at which time cyclohexamide ( Sigma) was added directly to the culture to a final concentration of 100 micro g / ml.

To probe functionality of this fusion protein, we used two - step gene replacement ( 18) to substitute the modified allele into the SCP160 locus of haploid yeast, and then tested the morphological phenotype of the resultant cells.

To test the hypothesis that Scp160p associates with polyribosomes we used sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation to size - fractionate subcellular components of lysates prepared from yeast expressing the N - terminal FLAG - tagged Scp160p protein.

A convenient internal control for these gradients was provided by an unknown endogenous yeast cross - reacting protein at ~ 100 kDa, that exemplified the migration pattern of a free protein, appearing only in the upper fractions of the gradient ( Fig. 2A, open arrow).

To determine whether the migration pattern of Scp160p in these sucrose gradients truly reflected association with yeast polyribosomes, lysates were pre - treated with either 30 mM EDTA or 50 U / ml RNase One ( Promega) immediately prior to sucrose gradient fractionation.

When compared to healthy controls, geometric mean and 95% confidence interval ( IC95%) of plasma D - dimer were significantly increased in SSc patients ( 362 ng / mL, IC 95%: 361 - 363 ng / mL vs 229 ng / mL, IC95%: 228 - 231 ng / mL, p = 0. 005).

Some earlier investigations suggested that SSc patients might be characterized by a procoagulant state, reporting depressed basal and stimulated fibrinolytic activity, while others studies have reported normal plasma fibrinolytic activity and normal skin and plasma tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA) levels [ 2 - 4].

Moreover, an increased D - dimer value in plasma is a reliable marker of a systemic prothrombotic state, likely superior to alternative fibrinolytic markers, and its measurement might be helpful in predicting or preventing thrombotic events in the single patient [ 5].

Plasma D - dimer was measured in 28 consecutive SSc patients ( 2 males and 26 females; mean age 50 + / - 15 years, 17 with limited and 11 with diffuse disease patterns), who fulfilled the American Rheumatism Association ' s criteria for the diagnosis of SSc [ 6] and in 33 control subjects, matched for age ( 48 + / - 13 years), sex ( 3 males, 30 females) and environmental habit, recruited among healthy hospital personnel.

Although endothelial cell apoptosis and impaired angiogenesis have received major attention among the mechanisms involved in the characteristic vascular dysfunction, recent studies provided clear evidence of a significant activation of the coagulation cascade, resulting in a procoagulant state that might finally raise the relative risk of thrombotic events in these patients.

Therefore, D - dimer is a well - recognized marker of a systemic prothrombotic state [ 5, 9] and appears a strong, consistent predictor of cardiovascular events in the general population, in patients with cardiovascular disease and in other pathologies characterized by an increased risk of thrombosis [ 10 - 12].

INTRODUCTION Ribonuclease A ( RNase A, bovine pancreatic ribonuclease) is the prototype of an enlarging family of proteins defined by distinctive elements of conserved primary structure and enzymatic activity ( 1, 2).

RNases 2 and 3, eosinophil - derived neurotoxin ( EDN) and eosinophil cationic protein ( ECP), respectively, have been characterized primarily with respect to eosinophil function ( 6, 7), although expression of EDN [ also known as RNase Us ( 8) or human liver ribonuclease ( 9)] is also widespread ( 5).

Although Southern analysis demonstrated that multiple copies of sequence homologous to mEAR - 1 and mEAR - 2 were present in murine genomic DNA, the precise nature of these copies - - as pseudogenes, polymorphisms, or distinct functional genes - - was unclear.

Although the sequences of the mEAR - 1 / mEAR - 2 / mR - 3 subgroup are slightly more similar to ECP and RNase k6, and mR - 4 and mR - 5, to EDN and ECP, the orthologous relationships of these murine ribonucleases cannot be discerned from these data.

DISCUSSION In this work, we have identified four novel murine ribonuclease genes that, together with mEAR - 1 and mEAR - 2 defined by Larson and colleagues ( 15), form an unusual cluster within the RNase A gene superfamily.	"murine	55	61	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""murine"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
These results suggest that the ` mR cluster ' emerged via multiple duplications of a gene that had already diverged from those encoding the other murine ribonucleases.

A causal relation between constitutive overproduction of BLyS and development of systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) - like illness has incontrovertibly been established in mice.	"mice	173	177	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 173, ""end_span"": 177, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Considerable inferential evidence points to a role for BLyS overproduction in human SLE as well.	"human	78	83	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Although a statistically significant correlation between circulating BLyS levels and SLEDAI has been appreciated in a more recent 24 - month longitudinal study of 245 SLE patients ( with > 1, 700 plasma samples analyzed) [ 10], the correlation remains weak.	"patients	171	179	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 171, ""end_span"": 179, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Although there are no practicable means of directly measuring in vivo BLyS production per se in humans, the level of BLyS mRNA may serve as a better surrogate marker of in vivo BLyS production than does the level of BLyS protein.	"humans	96	102	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""humans"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In the SLE patients, both full - length BLyS and Delta BLyS mRNA levels are more closely associated with disease activity ( SLEDAI) than are BLyS protein levels.	"patients	11	19	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Accordingly, BLyS mRNA levels may be a helpful biomarker in the clinical monitoring of SLE patients.	"patients	91	99	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

Each patient ' s sex, race, age, and medications at the time of the phlebotomy were recorded ( Table 1).	"patient	5	12	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

Clinical disease activity for the SLE patients was assessed using the SLEDAI [ 13] and using a modified SLEDAI that excludes the contribution of anti - double - stranded DNA ( anti - dsDNA) antibodies from the total score.	"patients	38	46	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Each patient ' s medical chart was reviewed for results of standard clinical laboratory tests within the previous or subsequent 1 - month period.	"patient	5	12	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Elevated plasma BLyS levels and blood levels of full - length BLyS and Delta BLyS mRNA isoforms in systemic lupus erythematosus patients	"patients	128	136	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Previous reports of elevated circulating BLyS levels in SLE patients were based on a BLyS ELISA that utilized a whole ( unfragmented) capture anti - BLyS monoclonal antibody [ 7 - 9].	"patients	60	68	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Since the publication of these reports, it has been recognized that the presence of rheumatoid factor can potentially interfere with the assay and lead to spurious overestimation of the true circulating BLyS levels ( Human Genome Sciences, Inc.; unpublished observations).	"Human	217	222	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Human"", ""start_span"": 217, ""end_span"": 222, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Overexpression of BLyS in SLE patients was also established by measuring BLyS mRNA levels normalized to beta - actin mRNA levels in peripheral blood leukocytes ( buffy coats).	"patients	30	38	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
BLyS is a potent B cell survival factor [ 15 - 21], and administration of exogenous BLyS to mice leads to B cell expansion and hypergammaglobulinem [ 1].	"mice	92	96	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Previous studies with numbers of SLE patients greater than were included in the present study documented a modest but significant correlation between serum levels of BLyS and IgG [ 8, 10].	"patients	37	45	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
( None of the BLyS parameters correlated with plasma IgM levels.) The absence of significant correlation between plasma BLyS levels and the immunoglobulin parameters also persisted when just the 53 patients with detectable plasma BLyS levels were considered ( r = - 0. 133, P = 0. 346 for total immunoglobulin; r = - 0. 048, P = 0. 734 for IgG; and r = 0. 033, P = 0. 817 for IgA).	"patients	198	206	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 198, ""end_span"": 206, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Consonant with those studies, we identified no significant correlation between plasma BLyS levels and SLEDAI in our cohort of 60 SLE patients ( Figure 3a).	"patients	133	141	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
As with the unmodified SLEDAI, the modified SLEDAI did not correlate with plasma BLyS levels ( Figure 3d) either among the SLE cohort overall or among the 53 patients in whom plasma BLyS levels were in the detectable range ( r = 0. 160, P = 0. 252), but it significantly correlated with full - length BLyS mRNA levels ( Figure 3e) and exhibited a trend toward correlation with Delta BLyS mRNA levels ( Figure 3f).	"patients	158	166	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 158, ""end_span"": 166, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Moreover, among the 37 SLE patients who were evaluated on two separate occasions, trends toward correlation were appreciated between changes in the unmodified or modified SLEDAI and changes in full - length BLyS or Delta BLyS mRNA levels but not changes in plasma BLyS levels ( Figure 4).	"patients	27	35	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Presence of anti - BLyS autoantibodies in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus	"patients	42	50	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In our cohort, IgA / IgM / IgG anti - BLyS antibodies were detected in six out of the 60 SLE patients.	"patients	93	101	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Elevated blood levels of BLyS protein and mRNA are well described features of human SLE [ 7 - 9].	"human	78	83	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The modestly elevated plasma BLyS protein levels in RA patients may reflect, at least in part, release of locally overproduced BLyS into the circulation.	"patients	55	63	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In the largest study to date, a 2 - year longitudinal study of 245 patients in which more than 1, 700 plasma samples were analyzed, a significant but weak correlation between the two was appreciated [ 10].	"patients	67	75	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Moreover, development of precocious glomerular pathology in autoimmune - prone mice correlates strongly with circulating BLyS levels [ 25].	"mice	79	83	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Rather, a more tenable explanation is that circulating BLyS levels in human SLE do not always accurately reflect excessive endogenous BLyS production.	"human	70	75	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
First, SLE patients frequently develop autoantibodies to a myriad of self - targets ( for example, erythrocytes, lymphocytes).	"patients	11	19	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Indeed, we detected circulating IgA / IgM / IgG anti - BLyS autoantibodies in 10% ( 6 / 60) of the tested SLE patients, and we detected circulating IgG anti - BLyS autoantibodies in 5% ( 3 / 60).	"patients	110	118	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Second, increased urinary excretion of BLyS has been reported in SLE patients, especially among those with clinically overt renal involvement [ 26].	"patients	69	77	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Although other interpretations are possible, the most likely explanation is that BLyS receptors on B cells in SLE patients are occupied in vivo by soluble BLyS.	"patients	114	122	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Indeed, circulating levels of BLyS rise with peripheral blood B cell depletion and fall with re - emergence of peripheral blood B cells in rituximab - treated RA or SLE patients [ 28, 29], highlighting this inverse relationship between circulating BLyS levels and B cell load.	"patients	169	177	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 177, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Moreover, one of the hallmarks of active disease in human SLE is the increased percentages of activated B cells and plasma cells in peripheral blood [ 30 - 34], probably reflecting increased systemic numbers of activated B cells and plasma cells.	"human	52	57	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
At present, it is not known whether soluble Delta BLyS protein is present in the circulation of SLE patients or of normal individuals.	"patients	100	108	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Moreover, soluble Delta BLyS protein is not released from cells transfected with a vector containing just the extracellular domain of human Delta BLyS ( which encodes the soluble protein; A. L. Gavin, unpublished observations).	"human	134	139	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Longitudinal observations in large numbers of SLE patients will be necessary to establish or refute the utility of full - length BLyS and / or Delta BLyS mRNA to subserve this clinically vital function.	"patients	50	58	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This raises the possibility that dysregulation of Delta BLyS may contribute to overall BLyS dysregulation in at least some SLE patients.	"patients	127	135	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Not all SLE patients treated with a B cell depleting course of rituximab experience clinical remission [ 39], strongly pointing to the importance of non - B cells in disease pathogenesis / maintenance.	"patients	12	20	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Although mice completely devoid of BLyS have reduced numbers of mature B cells and harbor reduced levels of immunoglobulin, these reductions are incomplete.	"mice	9	13	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Thus, it is possible that some SLE patients harbor pathogenic B cells that are relatively insensitive to BLyS and could drive considerable disease activity even in the context of low endogenous BLyS production.	"patients	35	43	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Plasma total immunoglobulin, IgG, and IgA levels and disease activity ( as measured by SLEDAI) in SLE patients correlate more closely with peripheral blood leukocyte levels of BLyS mRNA than with plasma levels of BLyS protein.	"patients	102	110	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
These findings suggest that BLyS mRNA levels better reflect in vivo BLyS production than do circulating BLyS protein levels, and may be a useful biomarker in the clinical monitoring of SLE patients.	"patients	189	197	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 189, ""end_span"": 197, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
These findings also support the premise that BLyS overexpression not only promotes development of disease but also actively contributes to the ongoing maintenance of disease in SLE patients.

For air travel these synergistic findings were more apparent, while people shorter than 1. 60 m had an increased risk of thrombosis after air travel ( OR 4. 9; 95% CI 0. 9 - 25. 6) as well.

As the cases and control individuals were selected as couples, many pairs ( 135) had traveled together and were uninformative: as a consequence, 145 pairs in which either the patient ( 98) or the control ( 47) had traveled could be used for the matched analysis ( Table 2).

The risk of venous thrombosis was 8 - fold increased in people with factor V Leiden who had traveled by bus, car, or train ( modes combined) as compared to noncarriers who did not travel ( OR 8. 1; 95% CI 2. 7 - 24. 7).	"people	56	62	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""people"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
A BMI of 25 - 30 kg / m2 was associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis ( OR 1. 4; 95% CI 1. 2 - 1. 7), and the risk was slightly higher in patients with a BMI of 30 kg / m2 or more ( OR 1. 7; 95% CI 1. 4 - 2. 1).	"patients	152	160	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 152, ""end_span"": 160, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The combined effect of a higher BMI and travel was the sum of the individual risks ( Table 3), with the exception of people with a BMI of more than 30 kg / m2 who traveled by car, bus, or train, for whom the risk was 10 - fold increased ( OR 9. 9; 95% CI 3. 6 - 27. 6).

Also, the analysis of the combination of other risk factors with travel resulted in more clear - cut effects, despite the smaller number of cases: the risk of DVT was still clearly synergistically increased in patients with factor V Leiden who traveled, whereas the prothrombin G20210A mutation did not further increase the risk of travel ( Table 4).	"patients	210	218	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 210, ""end_span"": 218, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Furthermore, a BMI of more than 30 kg / m2 in combination with travel yielded high ORs for DVT both in people who traveled by car, bus, or train and in those who flew.

Being more than 1. 90 m tall in combination with travel resulted in higher ORs for DVT; the risk for short people was more increased after travel by air ( OR 6. 8; 95% CI 1. 1 - 43. 5) ( Table 4).

The effect of oral contraceptive use in combination with travel by car, bus, or train on the risk of DVT was studied in 589 women and was somewhat lower than the effect on the risk of all venous thrombosis ( SI 1. 9; 95% CI 0. 9 - 4. 2).	"women	124	129	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""women"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Additionally, the risk is further increased in short and tall people, who are likely to experience more immobilization and venous compression than other travelers.	"people	62	68	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""people"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The finding that taller and shorter people had an increased risk of venous thrombosis after traveling should be interpreted with some caution, as the numbers were small in these strata.

Furthermore, it is likely that other characteristics exist that also increase the risk - - person - specific ( e. g., other drug use), behavioral ( e. g., use of sleeping pills or alcohol consumption), and flight - specific ( e. g., class or seating) - - that need to be identified.

The role of the muscarinic system in regulating estradiol secretion varies during the estrous cycle: the hemiovariectomized rat model	"rat	124	127	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""rat"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Kawakami et al [ 12] showed that electrical stimulation of the medial basal pre - chiasmatic area, the ventro - medial hypothalamus, and the areas in the mesencephalon of hypophysectomized and adrenalectomized female rats resulted in a significant increase of estradiol ( E2) and progesterone ( P4) plasma concentrations in the contra - lateral ovarian venous blood.

Ether anesthesia ( N = 24): Groups of rats, on specific stages ( D1, D2 or P) of the estrous cycle, were anesthetized for 10 min and sacrificed one hour later.	"rats	38	42	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""rats"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
One hour after ATR treatment, rats were randomly allotted to one of the following treatments: unilateral peritoneal perforation, bilateral peritoneal perforation, ULO, or bilateral ovariectomy.	"rats	30	34	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""rats"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
For control purposes, untreated rats, on D1, D2 or P, were injected with ATR in the same dose as in their corresponding treatment group.	"rats	32	36	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""rats"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
When surgery was performed on D1, no significant differences in E2 serum concentrations were observed between rats with ULO ( animals with intact left or right ovary in situ) or perforation of the peritoneum ( Figure 1).	"rats	110	114	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""rats"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

As in rats treated on D1, E2 serum concentrations were significantly higher in animals treated on D2 with the left ovary in situ ( right ULO) than in animals with the right ovary in situ ( 49. 5 + / - 10. 8 vs. 26. 0 + / - 6. 9).	"rats	6	10	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""rats"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
ULO performed on the left side ( right ovary in situ), resulted in significantly lower ( 45%) E2 serum concentrations compared to rats with a unilateral perforation of the peritoneum ( Figure 1).

As observed in rats treated on D1 or D2, when the intact left ovary remains in situ, estradiol serum concentrations were significantly higher than in animals with the intact right ovary in situ ( 142. 0 + / - 14. 1 vs. 61. 5 + / - 6. 0).

Blocking the cholinergic system of rats with left side peritoneum perforation on D1 or P resulted in a drop in E2 serum concentrations ( 52%; 47%, respectively), while the same treatment performed on D2 resulted in a significant E2 concentrations increase ( 157%).

ATR treatment on D1 or P stages performed on rats with the left ovary in situ resulted in a significant drop of E2 serum concentrations ( 65%; 62% respectively).	"rats	45	49	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""rats"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

Blocking the cholinergic system on D2, to rats with bilateral perforation of the peritoneum or bilateral ovariectomy resulted in E2 serum concentrations increases ( 159% and 253% respectively), while injecting ATR to animals treated on P had no apparent effects ( Figure 4).	"rats	42	46	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""rats"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In the rat, the sensory information arising from the peritoneum is sent to the nucleus tractus solitarius and stimulates neurokinine - B receptors [ 17].	"rat	7	10	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""rat"", ""start_span"": 7, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Sectioning the SON of rats in P results in a sudden drop of P4 and E2 concentrations in the ovarian vein effluent [ 23], while the same procedure on estrus did not modify E2 concentrations [ 24].

[ 26], injecting GABA into pseudo - pregnant rats increases E2 concentration in the blood.	"rats	45	49	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""rats"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Present results indicate that injecting ATR, before unilateral or bilateral perforation of the peritoneum, to rats in D1 or P, results in lower E2serum concentrations; leading us to think that some of the neural fibers present in the peritoneum are muscarinic.	"rats	110	114	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""rats"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Previously, we showed that injecting ATR to rats in D2 results in increases of P4 serum concentrations originating from the adrenals [ 8], without having apparent effects on testosterone serum concentrations [ 11].	"rats	44	48	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""rats"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Since P4 and androgens are precursors in the synthesis of E2, we presume that this mechanism may explain the increase in E2 serum concentrations observed in rats with peritoneum perforation previously injected with ATR.

Based on the differences in E2 serum concentrations in rats with ULO, present results suggest that the capacity to release E2 by the left and right ovaries varies during the estrous cycle.

Because endogenous estrogens directly promote the growth of breast cancer cells, estrogen deprivation either by inhibiting its biosynthesis ( aromatase inhibitors) or blocking estrogen - mediated gene transcription ( tamoxifen) through its high affinity receptor, the estrogen receptor alpha ( ER alpha), are the primary lines of therapy for breast cancer patients.

shares with other FMDV clones and populations, notably, MARLS and C - S8p260p3d ( the two viruses showing the highest virulence for BHK - 21 cells; Figure 2A; Tables 1 and S1), three amino acid substitutions in 2C: S80N, T256A, and Q263H.	"FMDV	18	22	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""FMDV"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
To test whether any ( or a combination) of the three shared amino acid substitutions in 2C contributed to the increased virulence of FMDV, each of the mutations was introduced individually into plasmid pMT28 by site - directed mutagenesis, as described in Materials and Methods.	"FMDV	133	137	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""FMDV"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

In FMDV, the enhanced capacity to kill BHK - 21 cells was multigenic, including participation of non - structural protein 2C with three amino acid substitutions acting in a redundant fashion.

However, X4 clones were transferred more efficiently than R5 clones from dendritic cells to CD4 ( +) T cells, a fact that can contribute to the competitive advantage of X4 viruses in AIDS patients [ 35].

Nuclear polyhedrosis virus transmitted early to its host, the moth Lymantria dispar, was more virulent than virus transmitted late, although the latter was more productive because the virus could use more host tissue for replication [ 40].

In a study of the susceptibility of North American and non - North American breeds of Lymantria to several isolates of the fungus Entomaphaga maimaiga, mortality was scored in all cases.

However, virulence of the fungus, quantitated by the time of death of Lymantria, was, in some cases, inversely proportional to fitness, quantitated by fungal reproduction in the moth [ 41].

The results with FMDV clones H5 have documented that both fitness - enhancing and virulence - enhancing mutations can be incorporated in the viral genome in such a fashion that subsequent fitness - decreasing mutations associated with bottleneck ( plaque - to - plaque) transfers produce only minimal effects on virulence ( Figure 2).	"FMDV	17	21	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""FMDV"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Multiple fitness - decreasing mutations occur in the course of plaque - to - plaque transfers, distributed throughout the FMDV genome [ 11].	"FMDV	122	126	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""FMDV"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In contrast, determinants of virulence for BHK - 21 cells are multigenic, but concentrated mainly in some FMDV genomic regions.	"FMDV	106	110	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""FMDV"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This model is reinforced by the observation that three amino acid substitutions in 2C ( S80N, T256A, and Q263H) had a similar effect in enhancing FMDV virulence, and the three mutations in the same genome had an effect comparable to each mutation individually ( Figure 6; Tables 2 and S1).	"FMDV	146	150	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""FMDV"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We propose that a higher robustness of the FMDV genome with regard to virulence for BHK - 21 cells, rather than to replicative fitness in the same cells, underlies the different trajectories followed by fitness and virulence upon subjecting the virus to repeated bottleneck transfers.	"FMDV	43	47	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""FMDV"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The comparative analysis of FMDV clones and populations shows that shifts in virulence can occur even through the evolution of a single viral clone ( C - S8c1), with its restricted genetic diversity prompted by different replication regimes in the same host cells, which also have a clonal origin ( see Materials and Methods).	"FMDV	28	32	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""FMDV"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
However, the observation of a lack of correlation between fitness and virulence in a FMDV clone is relevant to current models of attenuation and virulence, since it shows that more virulent forms of a virus need not have a reproductive advantage, and that viral virulence is not necessarily a byproduct of viral fitness.

The results with FMDV infecting BHK - 21 cells cytolytically imply that the increase of virulence can be conditioned to the history of passage regimes undergone by a virus.	"FMDV	17	21	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""FMDV"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

Children are particularly vulnerable to lead poisoning - - more so than adults because they absorb more lead from their environments ( Baghurst et al. 1992; Grigg 2004; Guilarte et al. 2003; Jain and Hu 2006; Needleman 2004; Safi et al. 2006; Wasserman et al. 1998).

This might be the result of increasing exposure risk because older children might have more outdoor activities.	"children	67	75	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""children"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In addition, it may also be attributed to the fact that the heaviest lead - contaminated zone in air after the burning of the e - waste was 75 - 100 cm above the ground ( Wang and Zhang 2006), which was the height range for normal Chinese children 5 - 6 years of age.	"children	239	247	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""children"", ""start_span"": 239, ""end_span"": 247, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Although Guiyu is rural, the children ' s BLLs were nearly double those of a nearby urban area, Shantou City ( 7. 9 mu g / dL; Luo et al. 2003).	"children	29	37	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""children"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The lead contamination may have spread from Guiyu to nearby Chendian by dust, river, and air and contributed to the elevation of Chendian children ' s BLLs.	"children	138	146	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""children"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In conclusion, elevated BLLs in Guiyu children are common as a result of exposure to lead contamination caused by primitive e - waste recycling activities.	"children	38	46	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""children"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Lead contamination from e - waste processing appears to have reached the level considered to be a serious threat to children ' s health around the e - waste recycling area.

In the Abstract and Discussion, the percentage of Guiyu children with BLLs > 10 mu g / dL has been corrected from 88% in the original manuscript published online to 81. 8%.

By screening a conditional Caenorhabditis elegans cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain mutant at a semipermissive temperature with a genome - wide RNA interference library to reduce gene functions, we have isolated and characterized twenty dynein - specific suppressor genes.	"Caenorhabditis elegans	27	49	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Caenorhabditis elegans"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
When reduced in function, these genes suppress dynein mutants but not other conditionally mutant loci, and twelve of the 20 specific suppressors do not exhibit sterile or lethal phenotypes when their function is reduced in wild - type worms.	"worms	235	240	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""worms"", ""start_span"": 235, ""end_span"": 240, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
After shifting the parental worms to the restrictive temperature for 3 - 5 h prior to collecting embryos, these two proteins were prominently localized to centrosomes and to spindle poles that did not separate in one - cell stage embryos ( Figure 7; Videos S11 and S12).	"worms	28	33	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""worms"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Finally, we examined the localization of GFP:: DYRB - 1 and GFP:: DYLT - 1 in embryos from dhc - 1 ( or195) - / + worms grown at the dhc - 1 ( or195) permissive temperature of 15 degrees C.	"worms	114	119	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""worms"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Homozygous dyrb - 1 ( tm2645) worms also showed an egg - laying defect and produced small broods ( unpublished data).	"worms	30	35	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""worms"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Six of eight deletion alleles available for the 20 specific suppressor genes are homozygous viable, and six additional specific genes do not display lethal phenotypes when reduced in function by RNAi in wild - type worms [ 29].	"worms	215	220	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""worms"", ""start_span"": 215, ""end_span"": 220, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Interestingly, eight of the conserved genes in Table 1 have been implicated in human disease etiology, with three of them identified as the causative gene [ 39 - 41].	"human	79	84	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Thus, using sensitized genetic backgrounds for genome - wide modifier screens can identify roles for nonessential but conserved genes and thereby provide insights into human disease.	"human	168	173	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 168, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In fact, the only specific suppressor that did not display dynein - like localization was F10E7. 8, a homolog of yeast Far11 of unknown function [ 46], which was nuclear.

Interestingly, two yeast pleckstrin homology domain proteins, Num1 and mcp5 +, localize to the cell cortex and direct astral microtubule and dynein function, although they do not contain a Sec7 domain like EFA - 6 does [ 69 - 71].	"yeast	19	24	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""yeast"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In support of this view, physical removal of the intermediate chains of rat cytoplasmic dynein increased HC ATPase activity by about 4 - fold ( light chains were not monitored in this study but were likely removed as well) [ 73].	"rat	72	75	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""rat"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Finally, dhc - 1 - like phenotypes result from mutation or RNAi knockdown of three suppressing ACs in otherwise wild - type worms, indicating that they share at least some common and essential requirements.	"worms	124	129	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""worms"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
For example, DYRB - 1 is not absolutely required for viability because worms lacking this protein can be propagated, although they are extremely sick and do exhibit two dhc - 1 - like phenotypes ( Figure 8).	"worms	71	76	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""worms"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
However, Drosophila contains only a single Tctex1 gene, Dlc90F [ 74, 75].	"Drosophila	9	19	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
A Dlc90F null allele that deletes 80% of the open reading frame is essential only for sperm production but not for viability of male or female flies, despite the wild - type protein being incorporated into dynein motors and expressed in various Drosophila tissues [ 74].	"Drosophila	245	255	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 245, ""end_span"": 255, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Thus, at least in Drosophila, the Tctex1 dynein light chain family is not required for cell division processes like the HC is.	"Drosophila	18	28	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Interestingly, budding yeast does not possess genes for the Tctex1 or roadblock ACs, indicating that functional cytoplasmic dynein does not require these subunits that are conserved in many other organisms.

While the precise mechanisms by which CFTR contributes to this release are not yet known, a role for CFTR in ATP release into subretinal space is consistent with the reduction of certain ERG components in cftr - / - mice [ 58] and with the ability of apical ATP to activate conductances associated with these ERG components [ 43].

This pathway deploys novel classes of G - protein coupled receptors not found in the genome of S. cerevisiae [ 11], but the inductive signal is transmitted via a MAP kinase, Pmk1, that is a functional homologue of the yeast Fus3 MAP kinase where it serves a role in pheromone signalling [ 10].

Although a long latency period of toxicity after exposure to methylmercury ( MeHg) is known to exist in humans, few animal studies have addressed this issue.	"humans	104	110	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""humans"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

Fish, especially large predator ( carnivore) fish species, accumulate high concentrations of MeHg through the marine food chain, and exposure of pregnant women to MeHg through the consumption of fish has evoked widespread concern due to potential effects on offspring.

Consequently, risk assessments of MeHg exposure could be inaccurate because studies ( human or animal) usually do not focus on later stages of life and therefore could miss delayed effects.

Although epidemiologic evidence would be ideal for exploring the possibility of delayed toxicity ( and, indeed, data from epidemiologic studies form the basis of current risk assessment for developmental toxicity of MeHg), considering the complex effects of numerous potential confounders and the existence of multiple exposures in human populations, animal models would likely make important contributions to this field.

Using a relatively complex schedule - controlled operant behavior method, rats whose parents were exposed to MeHg ( 0. 5 or 6. 4 mg / L) from 4 weeks before mating and continuing to postnatal day ( PND) 16 were shown to be less sensitive to a change in the reinforcement schedule than were their nonexposed counterparts at 28 - 32 months of age ( Newland et al. 2004).

We evaluated the behavioral end points twice, once around 3 months of age and the other time around 1 year; the latter time roughly corresponds to the period when many behavioral performances, including OPF ( Acevedoa et al. 2006; Carrie et al. 1999; Gower and Lamberty 1993), PA ( Gower and Lamberty 1993), and MM ( Bach et al. 1999; Carrie et al. 1999), show alterations in this mouse strain.

At 12 weeks of age, a three - way ANOVA of the locomotion distance revealed that only strain was a significant factor ( p < 0. 001), reflecting the longer distance traveled by the MT - null mice ( Figure 2A).

In a previous study, the brain Hg concentration in mice perinatally exposed to 6 mg MeHg / L ( via water) peaked between PND0 and PND4 and was approximately three times higher than on PND21 ( Goulet et al. 2003).

( 2002) in their Figure 2, prenatal exposure of rats to MeHg showed a peak brain Hg concentration around PND1 that was four to five times greater than the level on PND10.	"rats	48	52	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""rats"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Also, Newland and Rasmussen ( 2000) reported a slight alteration of a complex operant behavior in rats at ages < 2 years at brain Hg concentrations as low as 0. 5 mu g / g at birth, although statistical significance of this particular effect was not clear.

It should be noted that rats have different Hg kinetics ( Hirayama and Yasutake 1986; Yasutake and Hirayama 1990) due to the high affinity of rat hemoglobin for MeHg ( Clarkson and Magos 2006).

Nevertheless, various behavioral examinations have shown age - related changes in the performance of mice at approximately 1 year of age in the OPF ( Acevedoa et al. 2006; Carrie et al. 1999), MM ( Bach et al. 1999; Carrie et al. 1999), and PA ( Gower and Lamberty 1993) tests.

Apart from this, an intriguing possibility is that the brain - specific isoform, MT - III, might contribute to the results we obtained because the expression of MT - III, together with MT - I, is increased in the brain of old rats, resulting in the low availability of free zinc for synapses ( Mocchegiani et al. 2004).

Furthermore, the tissue - specific overexpression of wild - type K16 in the epidermis of transgenic mice results in the hyperproliferation of keratinocytes and aberrant keratinization of cornified layers, leading to hyperkeratosis of the skin ( Takahashi et al. 1994).

In the present study, we showed for the first time that iAs induces the transcriptional activation of K16 in the human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT, through the ARE present in its gene promoter.	"human	113	118	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The promoter of the human K16 gene was recently cloned and sequenced, and several AP - 1 - like sites were found within the - 515 - bp region of the gene ( Wang and Chang 2003).

( 2003) demonstrated that NRF2 accumulates in the nucleus at constitutively high levels and produces various cytoprotective genes in embryonic fibroblast - and liver - derived Keap1 - null mice.

Surprisingly, these Keap1 - deficient mice also show a thicker stratum corneum epidermis, abnormal keratinization, and cornification in the esophagus and forestomach ( hyperkeratosis).

Hence, based on these results and on the findings from studies of Keap1 knockout mice, iAs may both cause hyperkeratosis and induce detoxification enzymes via the modification of NRF2.

Apart from access to local amenities, environmental characteristics may have limited influence on active travel in deprived urban populations characterised by a low level of car ownership, in which people may have less capacity for making discretionary travel choices than the populations studied in most published research on the environmental correlates of physical activity.

If habitual patterns of behaviour are environmentally cued, sustained change is likely to require a supportive environment in which people can be active [ 4, 5].	"people	132	138	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""people"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Among the correlates most frequently identified in such reviews - some ascertained using ' objective ' measures, and others in terms of people ' s perceptions - are the aesthetic quality of the surroundings, the presence of pavements ( sidewalks), the convenience of facilities for being active, the availability of green space, access to amenities ( destinations) within walking or cycling distance, safety from traffic and personal attack, and the lack of heavy traffic.	"people	136	142	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""people"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We focus on two specific hypotheses: first, that levels of active travel and overall physical activity vary with demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, but not necessarily in the same way; second, that these relationships may be partly explained by the perceived characteristics of the local environment in which people live and by their objectively - assessed proximity to motorway and major road infrastructure.

Some of the challenges of recruiting research participants in areas of deprivation have been described elsewhere [ 23]; these are superimposed on a downward trend in participation in even the best - resourced national population surveys [ 24] and an upward ( and socially biased) trend in opt - outs from the main alternative sampling frame, the edited electoral register [ 25].

The positive association with perceived proximity to shops suggests that for active travel to be undertaken in this population, it may be more important that people live close to the amenities they need than that they live in an environment with more favourable subjective or discretionary considerations such as attractiveness or noise.

However, as recent reviews have pointed out, the current weight of evidence for objective environmental correlates of walking is no greater than that for subjective environmental correlates [ 5] and it is entirely plausible that people ' s perceptions of their environment may be at least as important as their objective conditions in influencing their behaviour [ 6].

In the particular context of this study, residents may simply have adapted to adverse conditions in their local environment in the ways identified by Hedges in a qualitative study of people living close to new roads built in the UK in the 1970s [ 34] - particularly by attitudinal adaptation, which Hedges characterises as developing an attitude that it is futile to resist.

The main advantage of this model over in vivo animal models or ex vivo human biopsy samples, is the availability of live granuloma cells which facilitates analysis of their cell biology.

Interestingly, staining, in parallel, of serial thin sections from a patient ' s lesion biopsy with Oil red - O ( Figure 1C) and Ziehl Nielsen ( Figure 1D), showed that most of the bacilli ( arrow) were located in the same area as FMs, thus suggesting a strong association between the persisting tubercle bacilli and FMs within granulomas.

Case and control participants who were significantly communication impaired ( e. g. deafness, dementia, or psychiatric disease) were excluded ( fewer than five per country), and one case was excluded in the Philippines because of missing age data.

The person primarily responsible for household finances ( which may have been the case / control or another household member) was interviewed to assess PCE and assets.	"person	4	10	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""person"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The household informant was also asked about the number and type of context - specific assets owned by the household, including different types of furniture, electrical equipment, cattle, and vehicles.	"cattle	180	186	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""cattle"", ""start_span"": 180, ""end_span"": 186, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Per capita household expenditure was divided into quartiles, separately for each country, based on the distribution of the data for the case and control participants combined.	"participants	153	165	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""participants"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 165, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Case and control participants were matched reasonably closely by sex and location.	"participants	17	29	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""participants"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The mean PCE was less than US $ 1 per person per day in all three settings: US $ 26. 4 ( standard deviation [ SD] = US $ 34. 9) in Kenya, US $ 21. 7 ( US $ 48. 0) in Bangladesh and US $ 26. 1 ( US $ 23. 5) in the Philippines.	"person	38	44	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""person"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The ratio of dependents ( i. e., household member aged < 15 or > = 50 y) to independents ( i. e., household member aged 15 - 50 y) was similar between cases and controls in Bangladesh ( 1. 4 versus 1. 4), but the dependency ratio was higher for controls than cases in Kenya ( 2. 1 versus 1. 6) and the Philippines ( 1. 7 versus 1. 3), due to the smaller number of people of working age.	"people	364	370	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""people"", ""start_span"": 364, ""end_span"": 370, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Multivariate analyses showed that case participants were consistently poorer than controls in Kenya, Bangladesh, and the Philippines, using three different measures of poverty ( Table 3).	"participants	39	51	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""participants"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We might therefore expect to see a stronger relationship between cataract and poverty among the blind case participants who may have fewer employment opportunities than among those less impaired ( i. e., moderate visual impairment).	"participants	107	119	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""participants"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In this case we would expect to see a stronger relationship between poverty and less severely affected cases ( i. e., moderate visual impairment), as poor families may allocate money for surgery on members who are blind from cataract, so that poverty mainly restricts access to surgery among people who are moderately visually impaired.	"people	292	298	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""people"", ""start_span"": 292, ""end_span"": 298, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

A larger literature shows that poor people are more likely to be ill or disabled than their richer compatriots, ranging from general disability in India, Bulgaria, and Ghana [ 21]; common mental disorders in Brazil, Chile, India, and Zimbabwe [ 22]; deafness in Brazil [ 23]; and tuberculosis in China [ 24].

Another Tanzanian study found that people with higher levels of asset ownership were more likely to obtain antimalarials even though they were less likely to be parasitaemic [ 27].	"people	35	41	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""people"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Poverty may also limit the employment opportunities of the person with disability or their household members.	"person	59	65	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""person"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
People are more comfortable sharing information about expenditure than income, and it may be a more meaningful measure than income in an agrarian society as it reflects what the household is able to command based on its current income, borrowing ability, or household savings [ 31].	"People	0	6	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""People"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 6, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
PCE also has advantages over assets, as it may be more responsive to change, which will be important for the follow - up analyses of the study participants after they have undergone cataract surgery.	"participants	143	155	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""participants"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 155, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This discrepancy may be reasonable, as the World Development Indicators reflect national averages, while we sampled the households with elderly people in poor regions of the country, many of whom were visually impaired from cataract.	"people	144	150	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""people"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Furthermore, there were slightly fewer people of working age in the control households in Kenya and the Philippines, so adjustment for equivalence scores would be unlikely to explain the higher poverty among cases.

This study confirms an association between poverty and blindness and highlights the need for increased provision of cataract surgery to poor people, particularly since cataract surgery is a highly cost - effective intervention in these settings [ 34].

In previous studies, we found changes in the genotypic frequencies of this polymorphism in populations of different ages, suggesting that this could be caused by an increase in the intake of folate and multivitamins by women during the periconceptional period.

Dependence of folate degradation on skin pigmentation [ 17], nutritional habits or human intervention periconceptional periods could explain this genetic variation.	"human	83	88	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This hypothesis was based on the increase in the number of mutated individuals found in our population since the mid - 1970s [ 5] and the coincident increased intake of vitamins and folate by pregnant women in Spain [ 18, 19].

In our case, we suggest that the external factor is related to an increase in folate and vitamin intake in women in periconceptional period and does not affect to all individuals [ 18, 19].	"women	107	112	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""women"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We suggest that there is genetic selection in our population for the T allele of the MTHFR - 677C > T polymorphism, whose origin could be an increase in fetal viability during the early stages of embryonic development because of an increase in folate and vitamin intake by women in the periconceptional period that began to be established in Spain in the last quarter of the 20th century [ 18, 19].

These issues become more pronounced in rural and remote settings because smaller communities often only have one therapist; hence the systemic pressure of workload demands makes it difficult for the therapist to leave patient care.

More importantly, the success of implementing and sustaining such strategies requires future research to validate these strategies from the perspective of rehabilitation clinicians and human resource decisions makers ( i. e. local government, stakeholders, etc.) so that specific barriers and challenges can be identified.

We found no differences in the proportion of BrdU + cells that expressed NeuroD1 in Ngn2 + / GFP and Ngn2GFP / GFP mice ( 14. 2 + / - 1. 0% and 17. 4 + / - 1. 8% respectively; Figure 4K).

Interestingly, the absence of Ngn2 did not alter the identity of neurons in the DG granule layer in 2 week - old Ngn2 null mice.	"mice	123	127	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We next investigated if the cells that failed to develop into neurons in Ngn2GFP / GFP mutant mice, became glial cells.	"mice	94	98	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We next monitored the mitogenic activity of Ngn2 + cells in the DG of 2 week - old WT mice.	"mice	86	90	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We observed that over 50% of Ngn2 + cells in the DG of WT mice co - expressed the mitosis marker Ki67 ( Figure 5A).	"mice	58	62	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Inspired by this finding, we injected BrdU into 2 week - old WT and Ngn2GFP / GFP mice and compared cell proliferation in the DG.	"mice	82	86	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We observed 92% reduction in number of proliferating cells in the SGZ of Ngn2 null mutant mice ( 6. 7 + / - 0. 5) compared to WT ( 83. 6 + / - 1. 2) and heterozygotic ( data not shown) littermates ( Figure 5B - C).	"mice	90	94	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
To further explore whether Ngn2 + cells become post - mitotic or still proliferate after Ngn2 is downregulated, we performed immunohistochemistry on sections through the DG of Ngn2 + / GFP mice.	"mice	189	193	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 189, ""end_span"": 193, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In mice lacking Ngn2, we found the cells expressing GFP localized to the malformed ventral blade of the DG ( Figure 5F and G).	"mice	3	7	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We injected retroviruses carrying the gene for either Ngn2 [ 33] or NeuroD1, and the reporter gene eGFP into the ventricles E15. 5 rat embryos, in utero ( Figure 7A).	"rat	131	134	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""rat"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Three weeks later, when the rats were about two weeks old, we examined their hippocampi and analyzed the eGFP + cells.	"rats	28	32	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""rats"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The rats injected with control vector exhibited eGFP + cells within the hippocampus that were either star - shaped, progenitor / glial - like cells ( 14. 8 + / - 3. 4%) or neuron - like cells with long neurites ( 85. 3 + / - 3. 4%) ( Figure 7B).	"rats	4	8	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""rats"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In rats that we had injected with the vector encoding Ngn2, the eGFP - labeled, the transduced hippocampal cells were composed of 31. 9% ( + / - 5. 7%) progenitor / glia - like cells and 69. 4% ( + / - 6. 1%) neuron - like cells ( Figure 7B).	"rats	3	7	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""rats"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In contrast, virtually all of the transduced cells in rats injected with the NeuroD1 vector became neuron - like cells ( 99. 9% + / - 0. 1; Figure 7B).	"rats	54	58	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""rats"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Indeed, when we overexpressed Ngn2 the proportion of hippocampal progenitors that became NeuN + was no greater than in rats transduced with the control virus ( Figure 7F).

Finally, we examined whether the transcription factors and cellular markers that are expressed in rodents are also expressed in human hippocampus.	"human	128	133	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We performed immunohistochemistry on aged human hippocampal DG and found GFAP -, Sox2 -, Pax6 -, Nestin -, Prox1 - and NeuN - immunopositive cells.	"human	42	47	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This indicates that radial glia - like stem cells, neural progenitors and mature granule neurons are present in the aged human hippocampus ( Figure 8A - E).	"human	121	126	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
As for aged rodents, we did not observe the presence of Mash1, Ngn2, Tbr2, Tbr1 and NeuroD1 proteins in aged human hippocampus, using immunohistochemistry.	"human	109	114	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Interestingly, we also observed Sonic Hedgehog and Wnt - 3A transcripts, indicating that they are present in the human DG and supporting previous claims that they are important for the regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis ( Figure 8F; [ 34], [ 35]).	"human	113	118	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Finally, we show that different cellular markers expressed during hippocampal neurogenesis in rodents are present in human.	"human	117	122	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

Importantly, we observed that the same transcription factors and neuronal markers are also present in the adult human hippocampus and arranged spatially in a manner reminiscent with what we saw in rodents.

Typically some mitotically active eGFP + cells were present in the DG of rats injected with the Ngn2 retrovirus ( Figure 7P), and we observed that cultured Ngn2 - transduced cells are still capable of dividing.	"rats	73	77	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""rats"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Because neuronal differentiation still occurs in Ngn2 null mice, it is clear that compensatory, Ngn2 - independent mechanisms induce NeuroD1 expression.	"mice	59	63	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

Nonpolar deletion of SA1665, in heterogeneously methicillin resistant S. aureus ( MRSA) of different genetic backgrounds, increased methicillin resistance levels in a strain dependent manner.	"MRSA	82	86	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""MRSA"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
SA1665 is a new chromosomal factor which influences methicillin resistance in MRSA.	"MRSA	78	82	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""MRSA"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Methicillin resistant S. aureus ( MRSA) are an ever increasing threat, both in clinical settings and more recently as an emerging community acquired pathogen.	"MRSA	34	38	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""MRSA"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Heterogeneously resistant MRSA, when exposed to beta - lactam antibiotics, segregate highly resistant subpopulations, which are much more resistant than the majority of the cells [ 10].	"MRSA	26	30	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""MRSA"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The vast MIC differences between MRSA strains, the population heterogeneity within single strains and the dependence of resistance levels on external factors are reflected in these many structural genes and global regulators, which can influence resistance levels.	"MRSA	33	37	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""MRSA"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
While typically considered nosocomial pathogens, new faster growing and apparently more virulent MRSA have begun spreading in the community.	"MRSA	97	101	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""MRSA"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Interestingly, these emerging strains often express very low methicillin resistance, e. g. the MRSA clone spreading amongst intravenous drug users in the Zurich area, which has an in vitro doubling time of 25 min, but oxacillin MICs of only 0. 5 to 4 mu g / ml [ 23].	"MRSA	95	99	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""MRSA"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
To identify potential factors involved in mecA regulation or methicillin resistance levels in such an extremely low level resistant MRSA, we performed DNA - binding protein purification assays, using the mecA operator region as bait.

However, like most other low - level resistant MRSA, it can segregate a small proportion of higher resistant subclones in the presence of beta - lactams.	"MRSA	47	51	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""MRSA"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We hypothesized that regulation of methicillin resistance in such low - level resistant clonal lineages may differ qualitatively from classical heterogeneously - or highly - resistant MRSA.

To analyse the effect of SA1665 inactivation on methicillin resistance, nonpolar markerless deletions of SA1665 ( Figure 1B) were constructed in a selection of clinical MRSA isolates, which varied in their genetic background, SCCmec type, and mecA regulation [ 24].	"MRSA	169	173	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""MRSA"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Methicillin resistance in MRSA is primarily dependent on the presence of the mecA gene, however, resistance levels are generally governed by strain - specific factors including mecA regulatory elements and other chromosomal fem / aux factors which either enhance or repress the expression of resistance.

However, while nonpolar deletion of SA1665 was shown to increase oxacillin resistance levels in several heterogeneously resistant MRSA, its deletion had no effect on mecA transcription or PBP2a production.

The traditional use and strong scientific evidence to support their therapeutic efficacy could be important factors influencing the patient ' s decision.	"patient	132	139	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
It has been suggested elsewhere that patients with higher educational levels also tend be more involved in the management of their health; they tend to self - medicate or even suggest to their physicians the course of therapy.

"Although one in five patients using medicinal herbs stated that "" conventional medicines were not working "" as the reason for using this alternative healthcare modality, we noted that asthma severity does not affect the decision to use herbs."

Pepper and bayleaf have also been shown to exhibit anti - inflammatory properties [ [ 25, 26] 27].	"bayleaf	11	18	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bayleaf"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We therefore did not determine lifetime prevalence for the use of herbs in our patient sample, but we suppose that had this been included that there might have been a prevalence similar to those reported in the Jamaica [ 10, 11] and Trinidad [ 13] surveys.	"patient	79	86	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The survey was also limited in that by electing to conduct the study at a public health facility we obviously had a bias towards patients at the lower rung of the socioeconomic ladder, with lower income and educational status.	"patients	129	137	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
As a consequence, the results reflected patients from this demographic background.	"patients	40	48	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We may have expected a different outcome in asthmatic patients attending private institutions, where their characteristics would have been slightly different, as we noted that even in our sample the small number of persons with higher income and educational status tended to use more medicinal herbs for symptomatic relief.	"patients	54	62	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The study was also limited in that we did not ascertain the out - of - pocket expense for herbal remedies by patients, although most stated that herbal medicines ( which we supposed were processed, imported products) were more expensive than conventional medicines.	"patients	109	117	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We assumed that an additional expense would have only been incurred by those patients purchasing processed, imported herbs obtained from a herbalist, herbal shop or pharmacy ( 24. 1%) and who actually consulted a herbalist ( 10. 3%).	"patients	77	85	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We also reasoned that since all the other herbs used were inexpensive and available from either the backyard garden or supermarket ( 58. 6%) that the cost to patients selecting these remedies was minimal.	"patients	158	166	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 158, ""end_span"": 166, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The findings of this study are important in that local medicinal plants in Trinidad have been identified in the self - management of asthma in a significant number of patients attending the specialty clinic.	"patients	167	175	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 167, ""end_span"": 175, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Since herbs are here to stay and patients will continue to self - medicate with increasing frequency, it is imperative that healthcare providers become more knowledgeable on this modality and keep abreast with the latest developments in herbal therapy.
