Abstract	[]
The complex gene expression mechanisms that occur in plant mitochondria, such as RNA editing and splicing, are not yet well understood.	[]
RNA editing in higher plant mitochondria is a highly specific process which modifies mRNA sequences by C - to - U conversions.	[]
It has been suggested that in some cases this process is required for splicing.	[]
Here, we use an experimental model based on the introduction of DNA into isolated mitochondria by electroporation to study organellar gene expression events.	[]
Our aim was to compare processing and editing of potato small ribosomal protein 10 gene ( rps10) transcripts in heterologous ( wheat mitochondria) and homologous ( potato mitochondria) contexts.	"potato	49	55	Organism/Species"	"wheat	127	132	Organism/Species"	"potato	49	55	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
rps10 is a suitable model because it contains a group II intron, is absent in wheat mitochondria but is actively expressed in potato mitochondria, where transcripts are spliced and undergo five C - to - U editing events.

For this purpose, conditions for electroporating isolated potato mitochondria were established.	"potato	58	64	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
rps10 was placed under the control of either potato or wheat cox2 promoters.

We found that rps10 was only transcribed under the control of a cognate promoter.	[]
In wheat mitochondria, rps10 transcripts were neither spliced nor edited while they are correctly processed in potato mitochondria.

Interestingly, a wheat editing site grafted into rps10 was not recognized by wheat mitochondria but was correctly edited in potato mitochondria.	"wheat	17	22	Organism/Species"	"wheat	17	22	Organism/Species"	"potato	124	130	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Taken together, these results suggest that editing might occur only when the transcripts are engaged in processing and that they would not be available to editing factors outside of a putative RNA maturation machinery complex.	[]
INTRODUCTION	[]
Gene expression in plant mitochondria is a complex process involving multiple steps such as transcription, cis - and trans - splicing, RNA trimming and RNA editing on the way to translation ( 1).	[]
RNA editing has been found in a variety of organisms and occurs through different mechanisms such as insertion or deletion of nucleotides, or base conversions [ for details see reference ( 2)].	[]
In higher plant organelles, RNA editing is an important post - transcriptional event characterized by C - to - U changes via a deamination mechanism ( 3 - 5).	[]
In Arabidopsis thaliana 456 C - to - U editing events have been described ( 6).	"Arabidopsis thaliana	3	23	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Arabidopsis thaliana"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
RNA editing occurs mostly in the coding regions which alter the identity of the encoded amino acid, but some editing events occur in highly structured regions of introns ( 7, 8).	[]
Like other maturation processes, RNA editing is an essential post - transcriptional event in plant mitochondrial gene expression ( 9 - 11) required for the synthesis of functional proteins ( 12, 13).	[]
The introduction of foreign DNA into isolated mitochondria is a novel experimental model which has provided important information on RNA editing and RNA splicing enabling the use of a site - directed mutagenesis approach ( 14, 15).	[]
Using a cognate cox2 chimeric gene construct, the cis - recognition elements required for plant mitochondria RNA editing have been determined ( 16, 17).	[]
Using the same approach, Staudinger and Kempken ( 18) have reported that transcripts from A. thaliana cox2, but not Sorghum bicolor atp6, are edited when the genes are introduced into maize mitochondria.	"Sorghum bicolor	116	131	Organism/Species"	"maize	184	189	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Sorghum bicolor"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""maize"", ""start_span"": 184, ""end_span"": 189, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Interestingly, higher plant mitochondrial genomes differ in their gene contents due to an evolutionary information transfer from the organelle to the nucleus ( 19).	[]
Of particular interest is the situation of the small ribosomal protein 10 gene ( rps10), a group II intron - bearing gene which is encoded in Solanum tuberosum mitochondrial DNA but is absent from the wheat mitochondrial genome ( 20).	"Solanum tuberosum	142	159	Organism/Species"	"wheat	201	206	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Solanum tuberosum"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 159, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 201, ""end_span"": 206, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Higher plant mitochondria contain group II introns either in cis - or trans - configuration ( 1) which can be folded in a characteristic secondary structure ( 21).	[]
Intron removal in plant mitochondrial mRNAs is not well documented because such introns are unable to self - splice.	[]
Previously, we described that electroporated cox2 constructs were a good model for the study of the splicing process.	[]
Using this model, we found that editing and splicing of cox2 transcripts were not linked in wheat mitochondria ( 15).	"wheat	92	97	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
To challenge the ability of mitochondrial gene expression machinery to recognize genetic information which has been lost during evolution, we decided to introduce the S. tuberosum non - cognate rps10 gene into wheat mitochondria.	"wheat	210	215	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 210, ""end_span"": 215, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Five C residues are changed to U in potato mitochondria rps10 transcripts by editing.	"potato	36	42	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Two of them have been postulated as being necessary for acquisition of a proper secondary and / or tertiary structure for splicing.	[]
To test this hypothesis, it was necessary to set up the conditions for electroporation of foreign DNA into S. tuberosum mitochondria.	[]
Here, we show that a potato rps10 construct is transcribed when introduced into wheat mitochondria, but transcripts are not recognized by the post - transcriptional processing machinery.	"potato	21	27	Organism/Species"	"wheat	80	85	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In contrast, a rps10 construct is correctly expressed and processed in cognate potato mitochondria.	"potato	79	85	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Moreover, we present evidence that transcript editing might be linked to overall RNA processing.	[]
This is the first report on DNA electroporation into potato mitochondria.	"potato	53	59	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
MATERIALS AND METHODS	[]
Plasmids	[]
All plasmids used in this study are based on the previously described pCOXII vector ( 14).	[]
An NsiI restriction site was introduced at the initiation codon of the wheat cox2 open reading frame ( ORF).	"wheat	71	76	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Then, NsiI was used in combination with a SpeI restriction site present in the original vector after the stop codon, to produce the chimeric vectors.	[]
S. tuberosum cox2 gene, including a 727 bp non - coding upstream region, was isolated by PCR from total DNA using the primer A designed from partial sequences reported by L o essl et al.	[]
( 22), accession no.	[]
AF096321, containing the KpnI restriction sequence, and primer B derived from Triticum timopheevi cox2 ( AF336134).	"Triticum timopheevi	78	97	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Triticum timopheevi"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
A fragment of 2888 bp was obtained and cloned on pGEM - T vector.	[]
The complete sequence of the S. tuberosum cox2 was determined ( accession no. DQ18064).	[]
To generate the plasmid pCOXIISt containing the S. tuberosum cox2 gene, a KpnI / SpeI fragment containing the 727 bp upstream region and the complete coding region was used to replace the wheat gene from pCOXII.	"wheat	188	193	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 188, ""end_span"": 193, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
As for pCOXII, a NsiI site was inserted at the ATG start codon and a 23 bp fragment was inserted at position - 20.	[]
This 23 bp insertion provides a specific sequence allowing isolation of potato cox2 transcripts originating from the introduced DNA by RT - PCR.	"potato	72	78	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The chimeric wheat / potato cox2 gene was constructed by replacing 727 bp KpnI / NsiI promoter sequence from pCOXIISt with the 880 bp wheat upstream region from pCOXII.	"wheat	13	18	Organism/Species"	"potato	21	27	Organism/Species"	"wheat	13	18	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The vectors pRPS10W and the pRPS10St derivative, containing wheat and potato cox2 promoters, respectively, were constructed by inserting the 1178 bp rps10 sequence containing two exons separated by a 777 bp intronic sequence [ ( 23), accession no. X74826].	"wheat	60	65	Organism/Species"	"potato	70	76	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The coding region was isolated from total S. tuberosum DNA by PCR using primers D1 and D2 containing the restriction sites NsiI and SpeI, respectively.	[]
The fragment NsiI / SpeI was purified and cloned into pCOXII and pCOXIISt, replacing the respective cox2 coding regions.	[]
Since all vectors used here were based on pCOXII, they contain the downstream region from the wheat cob gene ( Ir - cob) ( accession no. AF337547) ( 14).	"wheat	94	99	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

The S. tuberosum rps10 construct under control of a wheat cox2 promoter ( Figure 1A) was incorporated into purified wheat mitochondria by electroporation as indicated in Materials and Methods.

After electroporation and incubation in expression medium, mitochondrial RNA was extracted and analysed by RT - PCR.	[]
The primers used allowed detection of the transcripts generated by the constructs introduced and excluded any product from endogenous cox2 ( or rps10 in the potato system).	"potato	157	163	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 163, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Two bands of 1204 and 427 bp were expected from precursor and mature rps10 mRNAs, respectively.	[]
Only precursor rps10 molecules were detected ( Figure 1B).	[]
As a control, a cognate cox2 construct ( 16) was used.	[]
In this case, the 2048 and 827 bp RT - PCR bands representing the precursor and spliced cox2 products, respectively were observed ( Figure 1B).	[]
In all cases, the PCR bands actually represent transcription products since when PCR was performed without the RT step we observed no amplification products.	[]
Previously, five C residues, two in exon 1, one in the intron and two in exon 2 have been reported to be changed to U by editing in potato mitochondria ( 23).	"potato	132	138	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
To determine if the non - cognate transcript could be recognized by the wheat RNA editing machinery, the 1204 bp RT - PCR product was sequenced.	"wheat	72	77	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
While wheat cox2 editing sites were correctly edited in control as expected ( Figure 1C, only site C77 is shown), all five editable residues in potato rps10 transcript remain unchanged.

cox2 C77 editing sites are identical in potato and wheat.

Failure of rps10 transcript splicing in wheat mitochondria is not linked to the absence of editing	"wheat	40	45	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
It has been suggested that residues C2 and C3 participate in the secondary structure of the intron necessary for splicing ( 23).	[]
A possible explanation to the failure observed in precursor rps10 splicing could be that the absence of edition of C2 and C3 prevent the intron from organizing itself in a catalytically competent conformation.	[]
To test this hypothesis, single C2 and C3 mutants and a C2 + C3 double mutant were constructed by changing the C residues to T.	[]
Neither single nor double mutants were able to undergo splicing ( Figure 2).	[]
Electroporation of S. tuberosum mitochondria	[]
Since two important post - transcriptional processes, RNA editing and splicing, were inoperative when S. tuberosum rps10 was expressed in wheat mitochondria, we decided to verify whether the negative results were inherent to the rps10 chimeric constructs or due to the lack of trans - recognition elements in wheat mitochondria.	"wheat	138	143	Organism/Species"	"wheat	138	143	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
For this purpose, it was necessary to set up an electroporation protocol adapted to S. tuberosum mitochondria.	[]
Purified organelles were prepared from potato tubers as indicated in Materials and Methods.	"potato	39	45	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Electric pulses in the range between 8 and 20 kV were performed.	[]
Internalization of exogenous DNA was measured by DNAse protection assays ( 14).	[]
Potato mitochondria show a broad range response with a maximum around 13 kV ( Figure 3).	"Potato	0	6	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Potato"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 6, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This voltage setting was therefore used for further experiments.	[]

To ascertain the ability of electroporated mitochondria to perform expression of the exogenous gene construct, we used a plasmid containing the potato cox2 gene controlled either by T. aestivum or S. tuberosum promoters.	"potato	144	150	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
As shown in Figure 4, the construct containing the wheat or potato promoters was transcribed only in cognate mitochondria.

In potato, the mature product is barely detectable.	"potato	3	9	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In contrast to wheat mitochondria, the 821 nt mature transcript was only detected when the electroporated potato mitochondria were incubated in the presence of fatty acid - free BSA.

After incubation, the precursor and mature transcripts were amplified by RT - PCR ( Figure 5A) and sequenced.	[]
As shown in Figure 5B, the four editing sites C1, C2, C4 and C5, described previously in endogenous transcripts, were found edited in mature mRNA.	[]
The presence of spliced molecules containing unedited residues ( Figure 5B) indicates that rps10 transcripts could be spliced before editing.	[]
To confirm this observation, the PCR product was cloned and sequenced.	[]
One half of the individual clones were found edited at sites C1 and C2; 65% were edited at site C4 and 25% were edited at site C5.	[]
A cognate editing site in a non - native context is not recognized by wheat mitochondria but is recognized in heterologous mitochondria	"wheat	70	75	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
To test whether wheat mitochondria are able to edit a cognate site when placed in the context of a potato transcript, we introduced the C259 - 16 / + 6 region from wheat cox2 into potato rps10 exon 1 or intron ( Figure 6A, construct MA and ME6, respectively).	"wheat	16	21	Organism/Species"	"potato	99	105	Organism/Species"	"wheat	16	21	Organism/Species"	"potato	99	105	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
As reported previously, the 23 nt region forming the C259 editing site from wheat cox2 was efficiently edited when grafted into a different context in a wheat transcript ( 17).	"wheat	76	81	Organism/Species"	"wheat	76	81	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Wild - type rps10 ( pRPS10W) and the MA and ME6 mutants were expressed in wheat mitochondria but no splicing was observed ( Figure 6B).	"wheat	74	79	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Unexpectedly, wheat mitochondria appear to be unable to edit the cognate C259 site when the - 16 / + 6 region is located on a potato rps10 precursor.	"wheat	14	19	Organism/Species"	"potato	126	132	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The control CM construct, containing the C259 site grafted in a different context but in its own cox2 gene, was expressed, spliced and edited as expected [ ( 17), Figure 6B and D].	[]
To compare the editing status of RNAs at the same stage of processing, the editing status of the inserted C259 site in precursor cox2 transcripts is shown ( Figure 6D).	[]
The analogous MAb and ME6b constructs, containing the S. tuberosum cox2 promoter and the C259 region inserted into rps10 exon 1 and intron were used to electroporate potato mitochondria.	"potato	166	172	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 166, ""end_span"": 172, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
As shown in Figure 6C, MAb and ME6b were expressed and spliced at the same level as the control in the homologous context, indicating that insertion does not affect the splicing process.	[]
Interestingly, while C259 insertion was not recognized in wheat mitochondria ( Figure 6D), the potato RNA editing machinery edited the inserted C259 region ( Figure 6E).	"wheat	58	63	Organism/Species"	"potato	95	101	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The C259 region inserted in the rps10 intron ( construct ME6b) was also edited, although at a very low level, showing that editing may precede intron removal ( not shown).	[]
DISCUSSION	[]
Plant mitochondria undergo complex expression mechanisms which are poorly understood.	[]
Most studies are based on analysis of in vivo mature or intermediate gene products giving clues on possible mechanisms and suggesting pathways operating in gene expression.	[]
Direct tests using in vitro approaches have been fruitful ( 4, 5, 24), but are hampered by the difficulty of obtaining active mitochondrial extracts.	[]
Previously, we devised an experimental model based on electroporation of isolated mitochondria that allows us to test gene expression of wild - type and mutant genes.	[]
This approach has been very useful in elucidating the process of RNA maturation in plant mitochondria, in particular splicing and editing ( 14, 15).	[]
The aim of this work was to analyse different gene expression events when a foreign gene was expressed in a heterologous context.	[]
rps10 was chosen precisely because this genetic information is lacking in wheat mitochondria but is active in potato mitochondria ( 20, 23, 25).	"wheat	74	79	Organism/Species"	"potato	110	116	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Moreover, rps10 transcripts undergo five C - to - U editing events in potato mitochondria and rps10 contains an intron, thus facilitating the analysis of post - transcriptional processing.	"potato	70	76	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
To best evaluate the expression of rps10 in the non - cognate mitochondria, it was necessary to set up electroporation conditions for introducing foreign DNA into S. tuberosum mitochondria.	[]
Potato tuber mitochondria were able to incorporate DNA essentially under the same conditions described for wheat embryo organelles ( 14), except that the optimal voltage range was larger.	"Potato	0	6	Organism/Species"	"wheat	107	112	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Potato"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 6, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
A major difference to wheat was that isolated potato mitochondria were viable for 3 - 4 h as measured by oxygen consumption ( data not shown).	"wheat	22	27	Organism/Species"	"potato	46	52	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Thus, to observe transcript maturation after electroporation the incubation mixture needed to be supplemented with fatty acid - free BSA ( see Figure 4).	[]
This behaviour probably reflects the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation by fatty acids during incubation of potato mitochondria ( 26).	"potato	113	119	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In fact, previously we found that proper gene expression in isolated mitochondria requires a functional organelle able to generate ATP from ADP and succinate ( 14).	[]
An interesting observation was that neither the wheat nor the potato cox2 promoters were recognized in a heterologous context ( Figure 4A and B).	"wheat	48	53	Organism/Species"	"potato	62	68	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This situation might by explained by the fact that potato and wheat promoter sequences have no recognizable homologous motifs.	"potato	51	57	Organism/Species"	"wheat	62	67	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Plant mitochondria promoters are characterized by a conserved core CRTA sequence with differences in the extent and the composition of sequences around the consensus motif ( 27, 28).	[]
While the transcription initiation site in wheat mitochondria is located at position - 170 ( 29), the potato promoter has not yet been described.	"wheat	43	48	Organism/Species"	"potato	102	108	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Transcription may be initiated at numerous sites suggesting a relaxed promoter recognition by the transcription machinery ( 28).	[]
However, the lack of crossed recognition of cox2 promoters in wheat and potato is not a general situation since the A. thaliana cox2 gene is expressed and spliced when introduced into maize mitochondria, indicating that the Arabidopsis gene shares some signals with maize cox2 promoter that are sufficient for transcription ( 18).	"wheat	62	67	Organism/Species"	"potato	72	78	Organism/Species"	"maize	184	189	Organism/Species"	"Arabidopsis	224	235	Organism/Species"	"maize	184	189	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""maize"", ""start_span"": 184, ""end_span"": 189, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Arabidopsis"", ""start_span"": 224, ""end_span"": 235, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""maize"", ""start_span"": 184, ""end_span"": 189, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The sites required for transcript initiation have been recently described in A. thaliana mitochondrial genes ( 28).	[]
Three regions were described as important for transcription initiation.	[]
We found no such homologous sequences in the potato cox2 upstream region indicating that the two dicot promoters do not have the same origin.	"potato	45	51	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This in turn may reflect the natural history of this particular mitochondrial gene evolving in its own context.	[]
It should be mentioned that the presence of a conserved sequence is not sufficient for expression since a region that acts as promoter in Arabidopsis, potato and Oenothera is inactive in vivo in pea ( 30).	"Arabidopsis	138	149	Organism/Species"	"potato	151	157	Organism/Species"	"pea	195	198	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Arabidopsis"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 151, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""pea"", ""start_span"": 195, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Further studies will be required to understand the transcriptional events in plant mitochondria.	[]
Electroporation of foreign DNA into isolated mitochondria provides an interesting functional model, complementary to in vitro transcription assay, for answering these questions.	[]
The potato rps10 gene controlled by a T. aestivum promoter ( Figure 1A) was transcribed as a 1204 nt precursor in wheat mitochondria, but no traces of mature RNA were observed.	"potato	4	10	Organism/Species"	"wheat	114	119	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Moreover, the five C residues reported as RNA editing targets in vivo ( 23) remain unchanged, indicating that rps10 transcript was not recognized by the wheat splicing and editing machinery.	"wheat	153	158	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
A control using the cognate cox2 construct demonstrates that electroporated organelles were competent for splicing and editing ( Figure 1B and C).	[]
Some editing events occur in highly structured domains of introns.	[]
Because in some cases, editing corrects A - C mispairing improving conformation of the intron, it has been proposed that the C - to - U change might be necessary for efficient splicing ( 8, 9, 23, 31).	[]
Based on the canonical structure of group II mitochondrial introns ( 21), two editing sites, C2 located at the Intron Binding Site 2 ( IBS2) and C3 located in the intron, nine residues downstream from the end of exon 1 in S. tuberosum rps10 are of particular interest.	[]
It has been predicted that both edited residues participate in base - pair interactions in the putative secondary structure.	[]
Of particular interest is the site C3 located in intron domain I ( 23).	[]
This position may be crucial for splicing as inferred from mutants of a yeast mitochondrial intron ( 32).	"yeast	72	77	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""yeast"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We addressed this question by introducing rps10 mutant genes presenting C2, C3 or both positions in the edited form into mitochondria.	[]
As shown in Figure 2, transcription was as efficient as for the cognate cox2 construct but neither wild - type rps10 nor the C - U mutants underwent splicing.	[]
These results clearly demonstrate that C2 and C3 editing is not sufficient for splicing of rps10 precursor in wheat mitochondria and lead us to conclude that splicing failure is probably linked to the lack of trans - recognition elements.	"wheat	110	115	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
One may speculate that these trans - acting factors, for instance nuclear - encoded maturases, were lost after rps10 was transferred to the nucleus in monocots ( 20, 25).	[]
The C - to - U mutants were also tested in potato mitochondria; no significant differences were detected in splicing efficiency when compared to the unedited construct ( D. Choury, unpublished data).	"potato	43	49	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
It should be noted that the lack of splicing in wheat mitochondria is not a general feature of potato introns, since the potato cox2 intron is removed efficiently ( Figure 4B).	"wheat	48	53	Organism/Species"	"potato	95	101	Organism/Species"	"potato	95	101	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This is consistent with the hypothesis that potato and wheat mitochondria have similar trans - acting factors for cox2 intron removal.	"potato	44	50	Organism/Species"	"wheat	55	60	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
A possible link between intron removal and editing has been proposed for splicing of nad1e and nad5III trans - introns where domain six may require editing to be structured in a catalytic competent secondary conformation ( 8).	[]
In rice, failure of RNA maturation and editing has been correlated with cytoplasmic male sterile phenotype.	"rice	3	7	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""rice"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In this model, the absence of the nuclear gene Rf - 1 affects B - atp6 RNA cleavage and editing ( 33).	[]
In organello studies have shown that S. bicolor atp6 - 1 gene was transcribed but not edited when introduced into maize mitochondria ( 18).	"maize	114	119	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""maize"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
However, partially edited molecules were detected in sorghum - maize atp6 chimeric transcripts when they included the maize atp6 5 ' - untranslated sequence, suggesting that the 5 ' non - coding region provides a structural motif or binding site for a transcript - specific editing factor ( 34).	"sorghum	53	60	Organism/Species"	"maize	63	68	Organism/Species"	"maize	63	68	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""sorghum"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""maize"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""maize"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Unfortunately, no data on atp6 processing was reported to determine whether this region is directly involved in editing or some other maturation event.	[]
Since wheat mitochondria do not have rps10 encoded in the mitochondrial genome ( 20), it was interesting to test whether wheat mitochondria were able to recognize editing sites which had been lost during evolution.	"wheat	6	11	Organism/Species"	"wheat	6	11	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In other words, whether the mitochondrial trans - recognition elements are specific for each site or whether they are operating on a subset of editing sites.	[]
This question is important since to date the factors responsible for RNA editing in plant mitochondria remain unknown.	[]
Solving this issue may provide clues to uncover such factors.	[]
As described above, the rps10 transcript was not processed in wheat but it was correctly spliced in cognate mitochondria ( Figure 5A).	"wheat	62	67	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Indeed, the mature transcript had identical exon1 and exon2 junction as found in endogenous rps10 mRNA ( data not shown).	[]
More importantly, all editing sites, C1, C2, C4 and C5 were significantly converted to Us ( Figure 5B).	[]
The fact that the four editing sites were found either edited or unedited in spliced rps10 mRNA is an indication that editing does not precede splicing as was previously found for cox2 in wheat ( 15).	"wheat	188	193	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 188, ""end_span"": 193, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
It may be argued that the absence of splicing precluded editing.	[]
This possibility can be discarded since potato rps10 precursor mRNA was found to be edited in vivo ( 23).	"potato	40	46	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
These data clearly show that splicing is not required for rps10 editing, similar to previous findings for cox2 mRNA and also in cox2 mutant derivatives unable to remove the intron ( 15).	[]
This led us to postulate that the inability of wheat mitochondria to recognize rps10 editing sites is likely due to the fact that wheat mitochondria have lost the editing trans - recognition elements which become dispensable after transfer of rps10 to the nucleus.	"wheat	47	52	Organism/Species"	"wheat	47	52	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
To test this possibility, rps10 chimeric plasmids containing editing site C259 from wheat cox2 inserted either in exon1 or the intron were constructed.	"wheat	84	89	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Site C259 is formed by 23 nt corresponding to the - 16 / + 6 sequence embedding the target C.	[]
Previously we found that this small region could be recognized by the RNA editing machinery when placed outside of its natural context ( 16, 17).	[]
The wheat C259 editing site in the chimeric construct was correctly edited by potato mitochondria.	"wheat	4	9	Organism/Species"	"potato	78	84	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This result is not unexpected since the corresponding region in endogenous potato cox2 mRNA, which presents two differences at positions - 3 ( C instead of A) and - 7 ( G instead of A), is edited.	"potato	75	81	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Furthermore, these positions were not crucial for editing of C259 ( 17).	[]
Surprisingly, the C259 editing site grafted in rps10 was not recognized by the wheat editing machinery.	"wheat	79	84	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We cannot exclude the possibility that editing efficiency in precursor molecules is very low and so is undetectable when sequencing RT - PCR products representing a pool of transcripts.	[]
However, analysis of the same region in cox2 precursors indicates that this was not the case since significant C - to - U conversion was observed ( Figure 6D).	[]
These observations lead us to postulate that editing is occurring only when the transcript is engaged in post - transcriptional processing, suggesting that rps10 transcripts are not available to editing factors independently of the RNA maturation machinery.	[]
The fact that the wheat editing site C259 inserted in chimeric rps10 transcripts was not recognized by wheat mitochondria is a strong argument for this hypothesis.	"wheat	18	23	Organism/Species"	"wheat	18	23	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
One might speculate that in plant mitochondria, transcripts have to be engaged in a kind of multiprotein processing complex.	[]
A failure to be recognized at some early stage will lead to their accumulation as unmodified precursors.	[]
Rap1p and other transcriptional regulators can function in defining distinct domains of gene expression	[]
Abstract	[]
Barrier elements that are able to block the propagation of transcriptional silencing in yeast are functionally similar to chromatin boundary / insulator elements in metazoans that delimit functional chromosomal domains.	"yeast	88	93	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""yeast"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We show that the upstream activating sequences of many highly expressed ribosome protein genes and glycolytic genes exhibit barrier activity.	[]
Analyses of these barriers indicate that binding sites for transcriptional regulators Rap1p, Abf1p, Reb1p, Adr1p and Gcn4p may participate in barrier function.	[]
We also present evidence suggesting that Rap1p is directly involved in barrier activity, and its barrier function correlates with local changes in chromatin structure.	[]
We further demonstrate that tethering the transcriptional activation domain of Rap1p to DNA is sufficient to recapitulate barrier activity.	[]
Moreover, targeting the activation domain of Adr1p or Gcn4p also establishes a barrier to silencing.	[]
These results support the notion that transcriptional regulators could also participate in delimiting functional domains in the genome.	[]
INTRODUCTION	[]
The eukaryotic genome is organized into discrete functional domains in which gene expression is either permitted or repressed.	[]
Domains permissive for gene expression are usually defined as euchromatin or active chromatin, and domains that repress gene expression heterochromatin or silent chromatin.	[]
The HML and HMR loci in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are silent chromatin domains ( 1).	"Saccharomyces cerevisiae	24	48	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Saccharomyces cerevisiae"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Compared to active chromatin, silent chromatin is more compact and its histone components are hypoacetylated ( 2).	[]
The SIR complex consisting of Sir2p through Sir4p is an integral part of yeast silent chromatin.	"yeast	73	78	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""yeast"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Sir3p and Sir4p interact with the N - terminal tails of histones H3 and H4 providing the structural basis of silent chromatin ( 1).	[]
Sir2p was recently found to be an NAD - dependent histone deacetylase and was suggested to be responsible for histone hypoacetylation in silent chromatin ( 3).	[]
Silent chromatin is initiated at small cis - acting DNA elements known as the E and I silencers flanking each of the HM loci ( 4).	[]
Increasing evidence indicates that histone deacetylation is key to the propagation of silent chromatin ( 4).	[]
In vertebrates and fission yeast, spread of silent chromatin involves a chain of events of histone H3 deacetylation - - > H3 methylation - - > binding of methylated H3 by HP1 ( heterochromatin protein 1) or swi6 ( 4).	"yeast	27	32	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""yeast"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In S. cerevisiae, there is evidence that Sir3p ( hence the SIR complex) has much higher affinity to unacetylated histone H4 than acetylated H4 ( 5).	[]
Based on this and the fact that Sir2p is a histone deacetylase, a refined model for the propagation of silent chromatin can be proposed.	[]
In this model, Sir2p recruited to the silencer deacetylates histones in an adjacent nucleosome enabling it to bind another SIR complex with high affinity.	[]
The nucleosome - bound SIR complex in turn deacetylates the neighboring nucleosome allowing it to recruit a new SIR complex.	[]
In this manner, the SIR complex promotes its own propagation along an array of nucleosomes ( 4).	[]
The fact that transcriptionally silent chromatin can encroach upon active chromatin poses the question of how interspersed domains of silent and active chromatin are demarcated.	[]
Studies of the Drosophila and vertebrate genomes demonstrated that some domains are delimited by boundary or insulator elements ( 6).	[]
These elements are specialized DNA sequences that act as barriers to enhancers and / or silent chromatin.	[]
One of the best characterized insulators is the chicken HS4 insulator at the beta - globin locus.	"chicken	48	55	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""chicken"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Histones surrounding this insulator are hyperacetylated indicating the presence of histone acetyltransferase ( HAT) activity at the insulator ( 6).	[]
Recently, sequences that could block the spread of silent chromatin have been discovered in S. cerevisiae ( 7, 8).	[]
These sequences ( referred to as silent chromatin barriers) include sub - telomeric anti - silencing regions ( STARs), the right boundary of HMR, and the upstream activating sequence ( UAS) of the highly expressed TEF2 gene ( 9 - 11).	[]
The mechanisms underlying barrier functions in yeast are not known.	"yeast	47	52	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""yeast"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
TEF2 - UAS contains three tandem repressor activator protein 1 ( Rap1p) - binding sites that are necessary and sufficient for its barrier function ( 11).	[]
Rap1p is an abundant sequence - specific DNA - binding protein ( 12).	[]
Variants of the 13 bp consensus sequence for Rap1p binding ( ACACC CRYACAYM) ( 13) lie not only in the UASs of numerous genes but also in the silencers of the HM loci and in telomeric C1 - 3A repeats.	[]
Accordingly, Rap1p functions as a global regulator of transcriptional activation and repression, silencing, as well as telomere length ( 12).	[]
Rap1p performs these diverse functions by interacting with different factors in respective contexts.	[]
As an activator, Rap1p binds to the promoters of 362 ORFs ( 13) and can function via at least three mechanisms.	[]
First, Rap1p binding can ' open up ' local chromatin structure at a promoter to help another activator to bind ( 14).	[]
Secondly, Rap1p bound to DNA can help Gcr1p bind to an adjacent site in the promoter through physical interaction ( 15).	[]
Thirdly, Rap1p is involved in the recruitment of the NuA4 HAT complex and TFIID to ribosome protein genes ( RPGs) ( 16, 17).	[]
As a silencing factor, Rap1p binds to silencers or telomeric repeats and recruits Sir3p / Sir4p through direct interactions ( 18).	[]
Rap1p also interacts with telomere - specific proteins in executing its role in regulating telomere length ( 19).	[]
It is puzzling that a protein that helps establish silent chromatin could also act as a barrier to its propagation.	[]
In this study, we found that in addition to TEF2 - UAS, UASs of many yeast genes exhibit barrier activity.	"yeast	69	74	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""yeast"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Analyses of these UASs indicate that binding sites for transcriptional regulators Abf1p, Reb1p, Adr1p, Gcn4p, as well as Rap1p, may participate in barrier function.	[]
These UASs are dispersed across the genome and might play a role in defining functional chromosomal domains.	[]
Moreover, we demonstrated that targeting the activation domain of Rap1p, Adr1p or Gcn4p alone, led to barrier function.	[]
Since the activation domain of an activator was usually involved in interacting with co - activators and / or components of the transcriptional machinery, these data indicated that other factors might also be involved in barrier function.	[]
MATERIALS AND METHODS	[]
Plasmids and strains	[]
Plasmids 1 - 53 were used to make strains 1 - 53, respectively ( see Figs 1 - 6).	[]
Plasmid 1 was previously named pMB22 - a that contained a HindIII - BamHI fragment of chromosome III ( coordinates 14838 - 16263) with a URA3 gene inserted at its EcoRV site ( 20).	[]
Plasmid 2 was derived from 1 by inserting TEF2 - UAS ( - 511 to - 407 bp relative to the translation start codon) at the SnaBI site.	[]
Plasmids 3 - 38 were identical to 2 except that different fragments from various promoters ( see Figs 1 and 2) were inserted at the SnaBI site.	[]
Plasmid 29 had a sequence of chromosome III ( 295327 - 295713) containing the HMR - tRNA gene ( 21) inserted at the SnaBI site of plasmid 1.	[]
Plasmids 39 and 40 were previously named pYXB26 and pYXB59, respectively ( 11).	[]
Plasmid 41 was identical to pYXB59 except bearing mutations illustrated in Figure 3A.	[]
Plasmids 42 - 48 were previously described as pYXB29, 48, 28, 27, 59, 31 and 37, respectively ( 11).	[]
Plasmid 50 was derived from plasmid 1 by inserting two copies of a sequence bearing the consensus binding sequence of LexA ( bold) ( 22), GGGGTACGTACTGTATGTAC, at the SnaBI site.	[]
Plasmid 51 was identical to 50 except having only one copy of the LexA - binding sequence.	[]
Plasmid 52 was derived from pYXB26 ( 11) by inserting a SpeI - ADE2 - AvrII sequence at the SpeI site.	[]
Plasmid 53 was derived from plasmid 52 by inserting TEF2 - UAS ( - 511 to - 407 bp relative to the translation start codon) at the SpeI site.	[]
Plasmid L1 ( see Fig. 5A) was made by inserting LEU2 into pBTM116 ( 23) carrying the LexA gene flanked by the promoter and terminator of ADH1.	[]
L2 through L8 were derived from L1 by fusing various sequences to LexA ( see Fig. 5A and B).	[]
Plasmid pRS425 ( 24) carried the 2 micro m origin and LEU2.	[]
Strain YXB76 was MATa ura3 - 52 leu2 - 3, 112 ade2 - 1 lys1 - 1 his5 - 2 can1 - 100, E - HML alpha - Iinverted ( 20).	[]
Y2047b was MATa HMRa HML alpha E Delta 79 - 113:: SUP4 - o I Delta 242 LEU2 - GAL10 - FLP1 ura3 - 52 ade2 - 1 lys1 - 1 his5 - 1 can1 - 100 [ cir0] ( 25).	[]
Strain 1 was made by transforming YXB76 to Ura + with HindIII + BamHI digested plasmid 1.	[]
Strains 2 - 38, 50 and 51 were similarly made with corresponding plasmids, respectively ( e. g. strain 2 was made with plasmid 2).	[]
Strains 39, 40 and 42 - 48 were previously described as YXB26, 48, 29, 48, 28, 27, 59, 31 and 37, respectively ( 11).	[]

Strains 40 ' - 48 ' were sir3:: URA3 derivatives of strains 40 - 48, respectively.	[]
The relevant genotypes of all the strains were confirmed by Southern blotting.	[]
Quantitative mating assay	[]
Quantitative mating was performed as described ( 11).	[]
Electrophoresis mobility shift assay ( EMSA)	[]
Rap1p was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 ( DE3) from pL3S5, a pET vector carrying the RAP1 gene downstream of a T7 promoter ( 26).	[]
Crude protein extracts were prepared from 40 ml cultures harvested after 3 h of IPTG induction and resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer ( 50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, pH 8. 0).	[]
A control extract was prepared from a culture without IPTG induction.	[]
Western blotting revealed that Rap1p protein was present in the induced extract but not the uninduced one ( data not shown).	[]
DNA fragments of 26 bp in length ( see Fig. 3A) were end - labeled with 32P - phosphate.	[]
Fifteen microliter binding reactions were prepared, each consisting of 20 000 c. p. m. radiolabeled DNA probe, 5 micro g of crude protein extract, non - specific competitor DNAs ( 0. 3 micro g of yeast tRNA, 0. 3 micro g of salmon sperm DNA and 0. 5 micro g of E. coli DNA), 10 micro g of BSA, 10 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8. 0), 10 mM MgCl2 and 8% glycerol.

Galactose ( 2%) was then added to the culture to induce the expression of FLP1.	[]
After 2. 5 h of incubation, nucleic acid was isolated using the glass bead method and fractionated on agarose gels with 30 micro g / ml chloroquine.	[]
DNA circles were detected by Southern blotting.	[]
RESULTS	[]
UASs of many highly expressed genes can function as barriers to the spread of silencing	[]
We have previously shown that TEF2 - UAS was able to block the spread of silencing in a silencer - blocking assay ( 11).	[]
Such an assay tested if a sequence had the ability to prevent a silencer from silencing a reporter gene when it was positioned between the silencer and the reporter.	[]
In this report we used a new silencer - blocking assay to identify more barrier elements.	[]
This assay employed the URA3 gene and an inverted HML - I that could silence sequences to the right of HML ( 20) ( Fig. 1, strain 1).	[]
URA3 expression makes cells sensitive to 5 - fluoroorotic acid ( FOA) thus URA3 silencing could be measured by cell growth on FOA medium ( Fig. 1, strain 1).	[]
As expected, TEF2 - UAS and another known barrier element, HMR - tRNA gene ( 21) exhibited barrier activity in this assay as indicated by the lack of silencing of URA3 in strains 2 and 29 ( Fig. 1).	[]
TEF2 encoding translation elongation factor 1 alpha is one of the most highly expressed genes in yeast ( 27).	"yeast	97	102	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""yeast"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Other highly expressed genes include ribosome protein genes ( RPGs) and genes coding for glycolytic enzymes ( 27).	[]
The coordinated regulation of most of these genes requires the so - called general regulatory factors Rap1p, Abf1p and Reb1p ( 28, 29).	[]
Using the above silencer - blocking assay, we tested if the UASs of other highly expressed genes could also block URA3 silencing ( Fig. 1).	[]
Seventeen new barrier elements were identified from a total of 26 UASs tested.	[]
These 17 elements were UASs of eight RPGs ( see Fig. 1, strains 3 - 10), eight glycolytic genes ( strains 18 - 25) and the HIS3 gene ( strain 26).	[]
All 17 elements except ADH2 - UAS and HIS3 - UAS exhibited very strong barrier activity as evidenced by the absence of URA3 - silencing in strains 3 - 10 and 18 - 24 ( Fig. 1).	[]
Seven of the eight RPG - UASs that had barrier activity, contained a single or a pair of tandem Rap1p - binding sites ( Fig. 1, strains 3 - 9).	[]
Three of them also contained an Abf1p or Reb1p site ( strains 6, 8 and 9).	[]
One barrier RPG - UAS ( strain 10) had only a predicted Abf1p site.	[]
Of the seven RPG - UASs that had no barrier activity ( Fig. 1, 11 - 17), only two bore no site for Rap1p, Abf1p or Reb1p ( 11 and 12).	[]
The remaining five each contained one to three Rap1p sites ( strains 13 - 17).	[]
RPL15A - UAS ( 17) also contained an Abf1p site.	[]
For most of the 15 RPG - UASs tested ( 3 - 17), the presence or absence of predicted Rap1p sites correlated with the presence or absence of Rap1p association in vivo as previously examined by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays ( 13).	[]
Exceptions were the UASs of RPS24B, RPS28A and RPL15A ( 13).	[]
Of the eight UASs of glycolytic genes tested ( Fig. 1, strains 18 - 25), seven exhibited strong barrier activity ( 18 - 24) and one had weaker but detectable barrier activity ( strain 25).	[]
Glycolytic genes are among the most highly expressed genes and their high expression depends on the functions of Rap1p, Abf1p or Reb1p as well as Gcr1p ( 29, 30).	[]
The seven strong glycolytic barriers all consist of one or two Rap1p sites plus one or two Reb1p or Abf1p sites ( Fig. 1, strains 18 - 24).	[]
In addition, one or more Gcr1p - binding sites are found adjacent to each Rap1p site.	[]
It was proposed that the function of Rap1p was to facilitate the binding of Gcr1p to the UAS ( 15).	[]
Abf1p or Reb1p was shown to play a role similar to that of Rap1p in activating glycolytic genes ( 31 - 33).	[]
Although the above data reinforced the notion that certain Rap1p - binding UASs could serve as barriers to silencing, they raised new questions about the essential components of a barrier element.	[]
For example, some of the UASs that contained only a single Rap1p site had barrier activity ( e. g. RPL19B - UAS, strain 3) whereas others that contained two or three sites had no activity ( e. g. RPL39, strain 16).	[]
One explanation was that sequences flanking the Rap1p site ( s) in a particular UAS could positively or negatively influence barrier function.	[]
Moreover, the presence of Abf1p or Reb1p sites in 11 of the 17 new barriers made us wonder if they also participated in barrier function.	[]
We began to address these issues by analyzing three new barrier elements ( Fig. 2).	[]
RPS10A - UAS containing an Abf1p - binding site and a pair of Rap1p sites was divided into three fragments that were tested in a silencer - blocking assay ( Fig. 2, strains 30 - 32).	[]
It was clear that only the fragment containing Rap1p sites functioned as a barrier ( strain 31).	[]
TPI1 - UAS bearing a Reb1p site and a Rap1p site was divided into two parts with one containing the Rap1p site ( Fig. 2, strain 34) and the other Reb1p site ( strain 33).	[]
Neither of these fragments alone retained barrier activity indicating that concerted action of Reb1p and Rap1p was required for barrier activity.	[]
Duplicating the Reb1p - bearing part of TPI1 - UAS didn ' t restore barrier activity ( strain 35).	[]
However, triplicating the Rap1p - containing part did re - create barrier function ( strain 36).	[]
RPS28A - UAS bore, in addition to a Rap1p site, an Abf1p site and an adjacent T - rich region that are required for efficient transcription of RPS28A ( 34).	[]
A sequence of RPS28A - UAS deleted for a fragment bearing the Rap1p site lost the barrier activity ( Fig. 2, strain 37).	[]
However, duplicating this sequence restored barrier activity ( strain 38).	[]
The above results indicated again that Rap1p sites could form barriers ( strains 31 and 36).	[]
On the other hand, they also suggested that synergistic actions of Abf1p sites ( strain 38), Reb1p site + Rap1p site ( strain 18), or Abf1p site + Rap1p site ( strain 16) could all lead to barrier function.	[]
This was not very surprising since Rap1p, Abf1p and Reb1p could perform similar and sometimes interchangeable functions in gene regulation ( 16, 35, 36).	[]
Note, however, we haven ' t ruled out the possibility that other factors ( e. g. Gcr1p) or structure features of DNA ( e. g. T - tracks) were also involved in barrier function.	[]
It was interesting that ADH2 - UAS and HIS3 - UAS bearing no site for Rap1p, Abf1p or Reb1p exhibited detectable barrier activity ( Fig. 1, strains 25 and 26).	[]
However, binding sites for other transcriptional activators existed in these UASs.	[]
The major regulator that binds to ADH2 - UAS is Adr1p ( 37).	[]
On the other hand, Gcn4p binds to multiple sites in HIS3 - UAS and activates HIS3 transcription ( 38).	[]
The possible involvement of Adr1p or Gcn4p in barrier function was examined below.	[]
Note Adr1p function was subject to glucose repression ( 37), which might explain why ADH2 - UAS only exhibited limited barrier activity since glucose was used in the media used in our assay.	[]
Effect of mutating Rap1p - binding sites in TEF2 - UAS on barrier function	[]
Although we had shown that the three Rap1p - binding sites in TEF2 - UAS were necessary and sufficient for its barrier activity ( 11), we had not shown if binding of Rap1p to these sites was required.	[]
To address this we performed mutational analysis of TEF2 - UAS.	[]
As shown in Figure 3A and B, the three Rap1p - binding sites in TEF2 - UAS ( designated as R1, R2 and R3) were all able to bind Rap1p in an EMSA ( Fig. 3B).	[]
Single or double C - - > A mutations were introduced into R1, R2 and R3 resulting in m1, m2 and m3, respectively ( Fig. 3A).	[]
The m2 and m3 sites had both lost the ability to bind Rap1p, whereas m1 still bound Rap1p ( Fig. 3B), which could be predicted from the specific mutations in each site ( Fig. 3A, compare m1, m2 and m3 to the consensus sequence).	[]
We then tested a mutated TEF2 - UAS containing m1, m2 and m3 in a silencer - blocking assay using the HML - E silencer and the HML alpha genes ( Fig. 3C).	[]
In this assay, the HML - I silencer was deleted but the HML - E silencer was sufficient to silence the HML alpha genes ( Fig. 3C, strain 39) ( 11).	[]
Silencing in strain 39 ( a - type) was measured by its ability to mate with an alpha - type strain ( Fig. 3C).	[]
As predicted, the wild - type TEF2 - UAS blocked HML alpha silencing ( 11) ( Fig. 3C, strain 40).	[]
On the other hand, the mutated TEF2 - UAS containing m1, m2 and m3 had lost barrier activity ( Fig. 3C, compare the mating efficiencies of strains 41 and 40).	[]
Therefore, mutations that prevented Rap1p from binding two of the three sites in TEF2 - UAS abolished its barrier activity, indicating that association of Rap1p with TEF2 - UAS at more than one site was required for barrier function.	[]
The barrier TEF2 - UAS alters local chromatin structure	[]
In eukaryotic cells, the topology of local DNA reflects the chromatin structure in which it resides.	[]
We had previously developed a DNA topology - based assay to examine chromatin structure in vivo, which involved excising a chromosomal region of interest from its genomic location as a circle using site - specific recombination ( 39).	[]
Using this strategy, we demonstrated that DNA in silenced chromatin was more negatively supercoiled than that in active chromatin ( 39).	[]
In this report we used the topology assay to address if barrier elements altered local chromatin structure as Drosophila or chicken insulators did ( 40, 41).	"Drosophila	110	120	Organism/Species"	"chicken	124	131	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""chicken"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Various sequences ( designated X) from UASs of TEF2, AgTEF ( TEF gene from Ashbya gossypii) and ADE2 were inserted between HML - E and HML alpha at HML Delta I ( HML locus deleted for the I silencer) flanked by the FRT sites for the Flp1p site - specific recombinase ( Fig. 4A and B).	"Ashbya gossypii	75	90	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Ashbya gossypii"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The FLP1 gene was under the control of the inducible GAL10 promoter ( 39).	[]
The mating efficiency of each strain measured silencing of HML alpha ( Fig. 4C).	[]
In strains 40, 42, 44 and 47, silencing was restricted to the left of the X insertions and HML alpha was derepressed ( Fig. 4C).	[]
Consistently, the proportion of silent chromatin in the region flanked by the FRT sites in each of these strains was decreased, as indicated by the reduced negative supercoiling of the excised circle ( 11) ( data not shown).	[]
Note that the above effect of a barrier on HML chromatin reflected both change in the scope of silencing caused by the barrier activity and alteration ( if any) in chromatin structure at the barrier independent of the silencing state of the locus.	[]
To exclusively examine the latter, we analyzed the topology of HML DNA in a silencing - deficient background.	[]
The SIR3 gene in strains described in Figure 4B was disrupted rendering them defective in silencing ( strains 40 ' - 48 ' in Fig. 4D).	[]
Recombination mediated by Flp1p in these strains led to the excision of a group of chromosomal circles that differed only in the X insertion.	[]
The supercoiling of these circles was analyzed as a function of the length of the insertion ( Fig. 4D).	[]
If an insertion simply lengthened a circle without causing abnormal changes in nucleosomal structure and / or density, the topoisomers of this circle would migrate slower relative to those of a similar circle with a smaller size.	[]
Otherwise, migration of the topoisomers would deviate from that predicted based on the size of the circle.	[]
As shown in Figure 4D, the circle from strain 40 ' bearing a 104 bp barrier element migrated faster rather than slower than the circle from strain 46 ' bearing a 91 bp non - barrier element.	[]
Circles bearing other barrier elements also exhibited unexpected faster migration ( compare strains 44 ' to 45 ', 47 ' to 43 ', 42 ' to 48 ', respectively).	[]
Therefore, these data indicated that barrier function correlated with altered topology of local DNA.	[]
This was further demonstrated by that mutations in TEF2 - UAS that abolished its barrier activity also abolished its effect on DNA topology ( Fig. 4D, compare 41 ' to 40 '; note that circles from both strains had the same size).	[]
Since in our gel assay more negatively supercoiled DNA migrate slower, we concluded that every fragment with barrier activity caused a reduction in negative supercoiling of approximately one to two turns in HML Delta I DNA ( Fig. 4D, compare the centers of distributions of topoisomers in pairs of lanes, e. g. 40 ' and 41 ').	[]
The topology of eukaryotic DNA reflects mainly the wrapping of DNA into nucleosomes ( approximately one negative superhelical turn is associated with each nucleosome) ( 42).	[]
Therefore, removal of one nucleosome would eliminate approximately one turn.	[]
On the other hand, histone acetylation can reduce negative supercoiling associated with a nucleosome by approximately 0. 2 turns ( 43).	[]
Therefore, acetylating five nucleosomes would reduce negative supercoiling by approximately one turn.	[]
Consequently, the linking number change of one to two brought about by TEF2 - UAS can be accounted for by either the loss of one to two nucleosomes or acetylation of five to 10 nucleosomes.	[]
Further experiments are under way to clarify the nature of change in chromatin induced by a barrier.	[]
Targeting the transcription activation domain of Rap1p recapitulates its barrier activity	[]
The multifunctional Rap1p can be divided into at least four functional domains ( Fig. 5A) ( 12).	[]
We were interested in defining which of these domains might be involved in the barrier activity of Rap1p.	[]
To this end, we fused various parts of Rap1p to the bacterial LexA protein and tested if targeting any of the fusion proteins to LexA - binding sites could re - create a barrier to silencing ( Fig. 5A).	[]
The LexA - RAP1 fusion genes were carried on 2 micro m based plasmids marked by LEU2 ( designated L1 - L6, Fig. 5A).	[]
When introduced into strain 50 in which two LexA - binding sites had been inserted between the inverted HML - I and URA3, LexA alone had no effect on URA3 silencing ( Fig. 5A, plasmid L1).	[]
Targeting the DNA binding domain, DNA bending domain, silencing domain, or the activating + silencing domain of Rap1p also did not affect URA3 silencing ( L2 - L5).	[]
On the other hand, targeting the activation domain alone recapitulated the barrier activity of Rap1p ( L6).	[]
These results indicated that the activation domain of Rap1p was involved in barrier activity.	[]
The inability of the Rap1p - silencing domain to block URA3 silencing in our assay did not necessarily mean that this domain had no barrier function, since such a function might be suppressed by much stronger silencing activity associated with the silencing domain.	[]
Was the lack of barrier function of fusion constructs L2 - L5 due to a lack of expression of these proteins?	[]
To address this possibility, we examined the levels of L1 - L6 proteins as well as L7 and L8 proteins described in Figure 5B by western blotting using an antibody against LexA.	[]
As shown in Figure 5C, L5 was expressed at a level comparable to L6, and L4 was expressed at a higher level than L6.	[]
Therefore, the lack of barrier function of L4 and L6 was not the result of their lack of expression.	[]
On the other hand, the level of L2 or L3 was significantly lower than that of L6, hence the lack of barrier function of L2 and L3 might be due to their insufficient expression.	[]
As an important control for the above targeting experiments, we showed that plasmids L1 - L6 ( Fig. 5A) as well as L7 and L8 ( Fig. 5B) bearing LexA - fusion genes had no effect on URA3 silencing in strain 1 ( Fig. 1) in which there was no binding site for LexA present between HML - I and URA3 ( data not shown).	[]
Hence, the effect of the fusion proteins on URA3 silencing was the result of their targeting to specific loci, not the consequence of non - specific, indirect functions ( if any) of these proteins.	[]
Targeted activation domain of Adr1p or Gcn4p can also act as a barrier factor	[]
We have shown above that ADH2 - UAS bearing Adr1p - binding sites and HIS3 - UAS bearing Gcn4p sites both had detectable barrier activity ( Fig. 1, strains 25 and 26).	[]
Given that tethering the activation domain of Rap1p is sufficient for barrier function, we tested if targeting the activation domain of Adr1p or Gcn4p could also establish a barrier.	[]
Adr1p contains four separate activation domains ( TADI - TADIV) that can contact Ada2p, Gcn5p and / or TFIIB ( 45).	[]
TAD III ( 415 - 467) interacts with only Gcn5p but not Ada2p or TFIIB.	[]
We fused this domain of Adr1p and the activation domain of Gcn4p ( 102 - 149) to LexA, respectively ( Fig. 5B, L7 and L8).	[]
Targeting these fusion proteins to two LexA - binding sites between HML - I and URA3 in strain 50 dramatically reduced URA3 silencing ( Fig. 5B, compare L7 and L8 to L1).	[]
Therefore, like LexA - Rap1p ( 627 - 695), both LexA - Adr1p ( 415 - 467) and LexA - Gcn4p ( 102 - 149) also had barrier activity.	[]
Barrier function of these fusion proteins was significantly decreased in strain 51 in which only one LexA site was inserted between HML - I and URA3 ( compare strains 50 and 51 carrying plasmid L7), indicating that the potency of such barriers was dependent on the amount of tethered fusion proteins.	[]
DISCUSSION	[]
We have shown in this report that UASs of many highly expressed genes could function as barriers to the spread of transcriptional silencing.	[]
These newly identified barrier elements together with previously described barrier elements ( STARs, HMR - tRNA gene, TEF2 - UAS and CHA1 - UAS) ( 9 - 11, 21) are scattered across the yeast genome and may play a role in dividing the genome into functional domains.	"yeast	184	189	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""yeast"", ""start_span"": 184, ""end_span"": 189, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Analyses of the barrier UASs suggest that binding sites for transcriptional regulators Rap1p, Abf1p, Reb1p, Adr1p and Gcn4p can participate in barrier function.	[]
Barrier activity often requires concerted actions of more than one factor - binding site.	[]
Our mutational analysis of TEF2 - UAS suggests a direct involvement of Rap1p in its barrier function.	[]
It is noteworthy that not all UASs of highly expressed genes have barrier activity.	[]
Many non - barrier UASs also consist of multiple regulator binding sites, therefore other unknown factors might determine whether a UAS could act as a barrier.	[]
How Rap1p and the other transcriptional regulators act to block silencing is not clear.	[]
Since they can all act as transcriptional activators, one natural explanation is that they may overcome the silencing effect of a silencer and directly activate the reporter gene.	[]
However, it has been well documented that Rap1p and the other transcriptional regulators usually act at relatively short distances ( less than ~ 600 bp upstream of the translation start codon) ( 28, 29, 46), but the binding sites for these regulators were > 800 bp from the translation start codon in most of the silencing - blocking tests in this report ( Figs 1 and 2).	[]
In the test shown in Figure 6, TEF2 - UAS blocked ADE2 silencing when it was ~ 2 kb downstream from the translation start codon of the gene.	[]
Moreover, Fourel et al.	[]
( 44) demonstrated that the barrier function ( or anti - silencing function) of an activator was independent of its role in activating transcription.	[]
Therefore, it is unlikely that the ability of a UAS to prevent gene silencing is due to its direct activation of the gene.	[]
In light of this, our results are in agreement with the notion that transcriptional regulators can also participate in defining the boundaries of functional chromosomal domains.	[]
A few models have been proposed for the barrier functions of transcriptional regulators.	[]
One model proposed that binding of a regulator to a barrier led to the formation of a nucleosome - free region thereby disrupting a continuous nucleosome array ( 11).	[]
Since the SIR complexes spread by self - interaction and interacting with adjacent nucleosmes in a stepwise fashion ( 4), a nucleosome - free gap could present a barrier to the spreading SIR complex.	[]
This ' nucleosome gap ' hypothesis is consistent with that certain barrier factors such as Rap1p and Reb1p could indeed prevent nucleosome formation around their binding sites ( 14) and the barrier function of TEF2 - UAS correlated with its ability to alter local chromatin structure ( this report).	[]
In fact, many insulator / boundary elements in higher organisms have also been shown to alter local chromatin structure.	[]
For instance, the chicken beta - globin insulator was linked to changes in nucleosome positioning, and the Drosophila scs and scs ' boundary elements are associated with unusual chromatin structures that are hypersensitive to nucleases ( 40, 41).	"chicken	18	25	Organism/Species"	"Drosophila	107	117	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""chicken"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
However, it is not clear whether any chromatin change associated with barrier function in yeast or insulator function in higher cells is the cause or effect of the function.	"yeast	90	95	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""yeast"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Another model for barrier action proposed by R.	[]
Kamakaka and colleagues ( 21) proposed that barrier factors recruit chromatin modifying and / or remodeling complexes to counteract the more compact, hypoacetylated silent chromatin.	[]
In agreement with this hypothesis, targeted HATs SAS2, GCN5 and ESA1 all had barrier activity ( 21; Y. - H. Chiu, Q. Yu and X. Bi, unpublished results).	[]
Interestingly, Rap1p, Adr1p, Gcn4p and Abf1p share the ability to recruit HAT complexes NuA4 and / or SAGA to target genes ( 16, 45, 47 - 49).	[]
Therefore, these factors that are capable of binding to the newly identified barriers may function as barrier factors by recruiting HAT complexes.	[]
In fact, recruitment of HAT activity has also been suggested to be the mechanism underlying the function of the chicken beta - globin insulator ( 6), although it was not known what HAT might be involved.	"chicken	112	119	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""chicken"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Our demonstration that tethering the activation domain of Rap1p, Adr1p or Gcn4p alone recapitulates barrier activity is consistent with the above HAT model for barrier function, since at least the activation domain of Adr1p has been shown to directly interact with HAT complexes ( 45).	[]
However, we haven ' t ruled out the possibility that the barrier function of the targeted activation domain of Rap1p, Adr1p or Gcn4p is not related to the barrier function of the native protein.	[]
Note that the ' nucleosome gap ' model and the HAT model are not mutually exclusive since the nucleosome gap could result from destabilization of nucelosomes caused by HAT function.	[]
A recent intriguing study showed that targeting proteins of the nuclear pore complex ( NPC) could also establish a boundary for silent chromatin, and that tethering to NPC was required for boundary activity ( 50).	[]
This led to a revisit to the looping model for the function of boundary / insulator elements ( 51).	[]
However, an alternative explanation was that the NPC compartment could simply be rich in transcriptional activating factors or poor in silencing factors like the SIR proteins ( 50).	[]
In summary, results from this and other studies indicate that factors previously identified as positive and / or negative regulators of gene activation could also function in demarcating distinct domains of gene activity.	[]
How these factors carry out their boundary function is not resolved but recruitment of other factors ( e. g. chromatin modifying complexes) is likely to be involved.	[]
NOTE ADDED IN PROOF	[]
After this work was completed and submitted for publication the first time, Fourel et al.	[]
( 52) reported that targeted activation domains of Rap1p and Abf1p had insulating capacity.	[]
Comparison of age - specific cataract prevalence in two population - based surveys 6 years apart	[]
Abstract	[]
Background	[]
In this study, we aimed to compare age - specific cortical, nuclear and posterior subcapsular ( PSC) cataract prevalence in two surveys 6 years apart.	[]
Methods	[]
The Blue Mountains Eye Study examined 3654 participants ( 82. 4% of those eligible) in cross - section I ( 1992 - 4) and 3509 participants ( 75. 1% of survivors and 85. 2% of newly eligible) in cross - section II ( 1997 - 2000, 66. 5% overlap with cross - section I).	"participants	43	55	Organism/Species"	"participants	43	55	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""participants"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""participants"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Cataract was assessed from lens photographs following the Wisconsin Cataract Grading System.	[]
Cortical cataract was defined if cortical opacity comprised > = 5% of lens area.	[]
Nuclear cataract was defined if nuclear opacity > = Wisconsin standard 4.	[]
PSC was defined if any present.	[]
Any cataract was defined to include persons who had previous cataract surgery.	"persons	36	43	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""persons"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Weighted kappa for inter - grader reliability was 0. 82, 0. 55 and 0. 82 for cortical, nuclear and PSC cataract, respectively.	[]
We assessed age - specific prevalence using an interval of 5 years, so that participants within each age group were independent between the two surveys.	"participants	76	88	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""participants"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Results	[]
Age and gender distributions were similar between the two populations.	[]
The age - specific prevalence of cortical ( 23. 8% in 1st, 23. 7% in 2nd) and PSC cataract ( 6. 3%, 6. 0%) was similar.	[]
The prevalence of nuclear cataract increased slightly from 18. 7% to 23. 9%.	[]
After age standardization, the similar prevalence of cortical ( 23. 8%, 23. 5%) and PSC cataract ( 6. 3%, 5. 9%), and the increased prevalence of nuclear cataract ( 18. 7%, 24. 2%) remained.	[]
Conclusion	[]
In two surveys of two population - based samples with similar age and gender distributions, we found a relatively stable cortical and PSC cataract prevalence over a 6 - year period.	[]
The increased prevalence of nuclear cataract deserves further study.	[]
Background	[]
Age - related cataract is the leading cause of reversible visual impairment in older persons [ 1 - 6].	"persons	85	92	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""persons"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In Australia, it is estimated that by the year 2021, the number of people affected by cataract will increase by 63%, due to population aging [ 7].	"people	67	73	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""people"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Surgical intervention is an effective treatment for cataract and normal vision ( > 20 / 40) can usually be restored with intraocular lens ( IOL) implantation.	[]
Cataract surgery with IOL implantation is currently the most commonly performed, and is, arguably, the most cost effective surgical procedure worldwide.	[]
Performance of this surgical procedure has been continuously increasing in the last two decades.	[]
Data from the Australian Health Insurance Commission has shown a steady increase in Medicare claims for cataract surgery [ 8].	[]
A 2. 6 - fold increase in the total number of cataract procedures from 1985 to 1994 has been documented in Australia [ 9].	[]
The rate of cataract surgery per thousand persons aged 65 years or older has doubled in the last 20 years [ 8, 9].	"persons	42	49	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""persons"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In the Blue Mountains Eye Study population, we observed a one - third increase in cataract surgery prevalence over a mean 6 - year interval, from 6% to nearly 8% in two cross - sectional population - based samples with a similar age range [ 10].	[]
Further increases in cataract surgery performance would be expected as a result of improved surgical skills and technique, together with extending cataract surgical benefits to a greater number of older people and an increased number of persons with surgery performed on both eyes.

Both the prevalence and incidence of age - related cataract link directly to the demand for, and the outcome of, cataract surgery and eye health care provision.	[]
This report aimed to assess temporal changes in the prevalence of cortical and nuclear cataract and posterior subcapsular cataract ( PSC) in two cross - sectional population - based surveys 6 years apart.	[]
Methods	[]
The Blue Mountains Eye Study ( BMES) is a population - based cohort study of common eye diseases and other health outcomes.	[]
The study involved eligible permanent residents aged 49 years and older, living in two postcode areas in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, Australia.	[]
Participants were identified through a census and were invited to participate.	"Participants	0	12	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Participants"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The study was approved at each stage of the data collection by the Human Ethics Committees of the University of Sydney and the Western Sydney Area Health Service and adhered to the recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki.	"Human	67	72	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Human"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Written informed consent was obtained from each participant.	"participant	48	59	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""participant"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Details of the methods used in this study have been described previously [ 11].	[]
The baseline examinations ( BMES cross - section I) were conducted during 1992 - 1994 and included 3654 ( 82. 4%) of 4433 eligible residents.	[]
Follow - up examinations ( BMES IIA) were conducted during 1997 - 1999, with 2335 ( 75. 0% of BMES cross section I survivors) participating.	[]
A repeat census of the same area was performed in 1999 and identified 1378 newly eligible residents who moved into the area or the eligible age group.	[]
During 1999 - 2000, 1174 ( 85. 2%) of this group participated in an extension study ( BMES IIB).	[]
BMES cross - section II thus includes BMES IIA ( 66. 5%) and BMES IIB ( 33. 5%) participants ( n = 3509).	"participants	80	92	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""participants"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Similar procedures were used for all stages of data collection at both surveys.	[]
A questionnaire was administered including demographic, family and medical history.	[]
A detailed eye examination included subjective refraction, slit - lamp ( Topcon SL - 7e camera, Topcon Optical Co, Tokyo, Japan) and retroillumination ( Neitz CT - R camera, Neitz Instrument Co, Tokyo, Japan) photography of the lens.	[]
Grading of lens photographs in the BMES has been previously described [ 12].	[]
Briefly, masked grading was performed on the lens photographs using the Wisconsin Cataract Grading System [ 13].	[]
Cortical cataract and PSC were assessed from the retroillumination photographs by estimating the percentage of the circular grid involved.	[]
Cortical cataract was defined when cortical opacity involved at least 5% of the total lens area.	[]
PSC was defined when opacity comprised at least 1% of the total lens area.	[]
Slit - lamp photographs were used to assess nuclear cataract using the Wisconsin standard set of four lens photographs [ 13].	[]
Nuclear cataract was defined when nuclear opacity was at least as great as the standard 4 photograph.	[]
Any cataract was defined to include persons who had previous cataract surgery as well as those with any of three cataract types.	"persons	36	43	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""persons"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Inter - grader reliability was high, with weighted kappa 0. 82 for cortical cataract, 0. 55 ( simple kappa 0. 75) for nuclear cataract and 0. 82 for PSC grading.	[]
The intra - grader reliability for nuclear cataract was assessed with simple kappa 0. 83 for the senior grader who graded nuclear cataract at both surveys.	[]
All PSC cases were confirmed by an ophthalmologist ( PM).	[]
In cross - section I, 219 persons ( 6. 0%) had missing or ungradable Neitz photographs, leaving 3435 with photographs available for cortical cataract and PSC assessment, while 1153 ( 31. 6%) had randomly missing or ungradable Topcon photographs due to a camera malfunction, leaving 2501 with photographs available for nuclear cataract assessment.	"persons	26	33	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""persons"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Comparison of characteristics between participants with and without Neitz or Topcon photographs in cross - section I showed no statistically significant differences between the two groups, as reported previously [ 12].	"participants	38	50	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""participants"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In cross - section II, 441 persons ( 12. 5%) had missing or ungradable Neitz photographs, leaving 3068 for cortical cataract and PSC assessment, and 648 ( 18. 5%) had missing or ungradable Topcon photographs, leaving 2860 for nuclear cataract assessment.	"persons	27	34	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""persons"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Data analysis was performed using the Statistical Analysis System ( SAS, SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).	[]
Age - adjusted prevalence was calculated using direct standardization of the cross - section II population to the cross - section I population.	[]
We assessed age - specific prevalence using an interval of 5 years, so that participants within each age group were independent between the two cross - sectional surveys.	"participants	76	88	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""participants"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Results	[]
Characteristics of the two survey populations have been previously compared [ 14] and showed that age and sex distributions were similar.	[]
Table 1 compares participant characteristics between the two cross - sections.	"participant	17	28	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""participant"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Cross - section II participants generally had higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, myopia and more users of inhaled steroids.	"participants	19	31	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""participants"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Cataract prevalence rates in cross - sections I and II are shown in Figure 1.	[]
The overall prevalence of cortical cataract was 23. 8% and 23. 7% in cross - sections I and II, respectively ( age - sex adjusted P = 0. 81).	[]
Corresponding prevalence of PSC was 6. 3% and 6. 0% for the two cross - sections ( age - sex adjusted P = 0. 60).	[]
There was an increased prevalence of nuclear cataract, from 18. 7% in cross - section I to 23. 9% in cross - section II over the 6 - year period ( age - sex adjusted P < 0. 001).	[]
Prevalence of any cataract ( including persons who had cataract surgery), however, was relatively stable ( 46. 9% and 46. 8% in cross - sections I and II, respectively).	"persons	39	46	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""persons"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
After age - standardization, these prevalence rates remained stable for cortical cataract ( 23. 8% and 23. 5% in the two surveys) and PSC ( 6. 3% and 5. 9%).	[]
The slightly increased prevalence of nuclear cataract ( from 18. 7% to 24. 2%) was not altered.	[]
Table 2 shows the age - specific prevalence rates for cortical cataract, PSC and nuclear cataract in cross - sections I and II.	[]
A similar trend of increasing cataract prevalence with increasing age was evident for all three types of cataract in both surveys.	[]
Comparing the age - specific prevalence between the two surveys, a reduction in PSC prevalence in cross - section II was observed in the older age groups ( > = 75 years).	[]
In contrast, increased nuclear cataract prevalence in cross - section II was observed in the older age groups ( > = 70 years).	[]
Age - specific cortical cataract prevalence was relatively consistent between the two surveys, except for a reduction in prevalence observed in the 80 - 84 age group and an increasing prevalence in the older age groups ( > = 85 years).	[]
Similar gender differences in cataract prevalence were observed in both surveys ( Table 3).	[]
Higher prevalence of cortical and nuclear cataract in women than men was evident but the difference was only significant for cortical cataract ( age - adjusted odds ratio, OR, for women 1. 3, 95% confidence intervals, CI, 1. 1 - 1. 5 in cross - section I and OR 1. 4, 95% CI 1. 1 - 1. 6 in cross - section II).

Discussion	[]
Findings from two surveys of BMES cross - sectional populations with similar age and gender distribution showed that the prevalence of cortical cataract and PSC remained stable, while the prevalence of nuclear cataract appeared to have increased.	[]
Comparison of age - specific prevalence, with totally independent samples within each age group, confirmed the robustness of our findings from the two survey samples.	[]
Although lens photographs taken from the two surveys were graded for nuclear cataract by the same graders, who documented a high inter - and intra - grader reliability, we cannot exclude the possibility that variations in photography, performed by different photographers, may have contributed to the observed difference in nuclear cataract prevalence.	[]
However, the overall prevalence of any cataract ( including cataract surgery) was relatively stable over the 6 - year period.	[]
Although different population - based studies used different grading systems to assess cataract [ 15], the overall prevalence of the three cataract types were similar across different study populations [ 12, 16 - 23].	[]
Most studies have suggested that nuclear cataract is the most prevalent type of cataract, followed by cortical cataract [ 16 - 20].	[]
Ours and other studies reported that cortical cataract was the most prevalent type [ 12, 21 - 23].	[]
Our age - specific prevalence data show a reduction of 15. 9% in cortical cataract prevalence for the 80 - 84 year age group, concordant with an increase in cataract surgery prevalence by 9% in those aged 80 + years observed in the same study population [ 10].	[]
Although cortical cataract is thought to be the least likely cataract type leading to a cataract surgery, this may not be the case in all older persons.	"persons	144	151	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""persons"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
A relatively stable cortical cataract and PSC prevalence over the 6 - year period is expected.	[]
We cannot offer a definitive explanation for the increase in nuclear cataract prevalence.	[]
A possible explanation could be that a moderate level of nuclear cataract causes less visual disturbance than the other two types of cataract, thus for the oldest age groups, persons with nuclear cataract could have been less likely to have surgery unless it is very dense or co - existing with cortical cataract or PSC.	"persons	175	182	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""persons"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 182, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Previous studies have shown that functional vision and reading performance were high in patients undergoing cataract surgery who had nuclear cataract only compared to those with mixed type of cataract ( nuclear and cortical) or PSC [ 24, 25].	"patients	88	96	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In addition, the overall prevalence of any cataract ( including cataract surgery) was similar in the two cross - sections, which appears to support our speculation that in the oldest age group, nuclear cataract may have been less likely to be operated than the other two types of cataract.	[]
This could have resulted in an increased nuclear cataract prevalence ( due to less being operated), compensated by the decreased prevalence of cortical cataract and PSC ( due to these being more likely to be operated), leading to stable overall prevalence of any cataract.	[]
Possible selection bias arising from selective survival among persons without cataract could have led to underestimation of cataract prevalence in both surveys.	"persons	62	69	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""persons"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We assume that such an underestimation occurred equally in both surveys, and thus should not have influenced our assessment of temporal changes.	[]
Measurement error could also have partially contributed to the observed difference in nuclear cataract prevalence.	[]
Assessment of nuclear cataract from photographs is a potentially subjective process that can be influenced by variations in photography ( light exposure, focus and the slit - lamp angle when the photograph was taken) and grading.	[]
Although we used the same Topcon slit - lamp camera and the same two graders who graded photos from both surveys, we are still not able to exclude the possibility of a partial influence from photographic variation on this result.	[]
A similar gender difference ( women having a higher rate than men) in cortical cataract prevalence was observed in both surveys.	"women	30	35	Organism/Species"	"men	32	35	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""women"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""men"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Our findings are in keeping with observations from the Beaver Dam Eye Study [ 18], the Barbados Eye Study [ 22] and the Lens Opacities Case - Control Group [ 26].	[]
It has been suggested that the difference could be related to hormonal factors [ 18, 22].	[]
A previous study on biochemical factors and cataract showed that a lower level of iron was associated with an increased risk of cortical cataract [ 27].	[]
No interaction between sex and biochemical factors were detected and no gender difference was assessed in this study [ 27].	[]
The gender difference seen in cortical cataract could be related to relatively low iron levels and low hemoglobin concentration usually seen in women [ 28].	"women	144	149	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""women"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Diabetes is a known risk factor for cortical cataract but in this particular population diabetes is more prevalent in men than women in all age groups [ 29].	"men	118	121	Organism/Species"	"women	127	132	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""men"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""women"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Differential exposures to cataract risk factors or different dietary or lifestyle patterns between men and women may also be related to these observations and warrant further study.	"men	99	102	Organism/Species"	"women	107	112	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""men"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""women"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Conclusion	[]
In summary, in two population - based surveys 6 years apart, we have documented a relatively stable prevalence of cortical cataract and PSC over the period.	[]
The observed overall increased nuclear cataract prevalence by 5% over a 6 - year period needs confirmation by future studies, and reasons for such an increase deserve further study.	[]

QGRS Mapper: a web - based server for predicting G - quadruplexes in nucleotide sequences	[]
Abstract	[]
The quadruplex structures formed by guanine - rich nucleic acid sequences have received significant attention recently because of growing evidence for their role in important biological processes and as therapeutic targets.	[]
G - quadruplex DNA has been suggested to regulate DNA replication and may control cellular proliferation.	[]
Sequences capable of forming G - quadruplexes in the RNA have been shown to play significant roles in regulation of polyadenylation and splicing events in mammalian transcripts.	[]
Whether quadruplex structure directly plays a role in regulating RNA processing requires investigation.	[]
Computational approaches to study G - quadruplexes allow detailed analysis of mammalian genomes.	[]
There are no known easily accessible user - friendly tools that can compute G - quadruplexes in the nucleotide sequences.	[]
We have developed a web - based server, QGRS Mapper, that predicts quadruplex forming G - rich sequences ( QGRS) in nucleotide sequences.	[]
It is a user - friendly application that provides many options for defining and studying G - quadruplexes.	[]
It performs analysis of the user provided genomic sequences, e. g. promoter and telomeric regions, as well as RNA sequences.	[]
It is also useful for predicting G - quadruplex structures in oligonucleotides.	[]
The program provides options to search and retrieve desired gene / nucleotide sequence entries from NCBI databases for mapping G - quadruplexes in the context of RNA processing sites.	[]
This feature is very useful for investigating the functional relevance of G - quadruplex structure, in particular its role in regulating the gene expression by alternative processing.	[]
In addition to providing data on composition and locations of QGRS relative to the processing sites in the pre - mRNA sequence, QGRS Mapper features interactive graphic representation of the data.	[]
The user can also use the graphics module to visualize QGRS distribution patterns among all the alternative RNA products of a gene simultaneously on a single screen.	[]

INTRODUCTION	[]
The quadruplex structures formed by guanine - rich nucleic acid sequences have received significant attention recently because of increasing evidence for their role in important biological processes and as therapeutic targets ( 1 - 5).	[]
The G - quadruplex structure, also known as a G - quartet, is formed by repeated folding of either the single polynucleotide molecule or by association of two or four molecules.	[]
The structure consists of stacked G - tetrads, which are square co - planar arrays of four guanine bases each ( 6).	[]
G - quadruplex is stabilized with cyclic Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding between the four guanines within each tetrad.	[]
The present work focuses only on the unimolecular quadruplexes, since it is more likely to be encountered in physiological conditions ( 7, 8).	[]
Guanine - rich sequences capable of forming G - quadruplexes are found in telomeres, promoter regions, transcribed and other biologically important regions of the mammalian genomes.	[]
G - quadruplex DNA has been suggested to regulate DNA replication in retinoblastoma susceptibility gene ( Rb) region ( 9).	[]
This structure may control cellular proliferation at telomeric level and by transcriptional regulation of oncogenes like c - myc ( 2, 10, 11) and c - kit ( 12).	[]
Formation of G - quadruplex seems to be regulated through interactions with cellular proteins.	[]
While some proteins help stabilize the structure ( 13), others are known to resolve it ( 1, 4, 14, 15).	[]
Proteins and chemicals that stabilize the G - quadruplex structure can inhibit telomerase action and, therefore, are being evaluated as anticancer therapeutic agents ( 16 - 20).	[]
Chemical compounds that inhibit G - quadruplex helicase activity may also be capable of regulating cellular proliferation ( 4).	[]
G - quadruplexes are also being eyed as potential antimicrobial agents due to their ability to transport monovalent anions ( 21).	[]
G - quadruplex motifs in the RNA have been shown to play significant roles in mRNA turnover ( 1), FMRP binding ( 22), translation initiation ( 23) as well as repression ( 24).	[]
We have shown previously that a G - rich sequence ( GRS) can mediate 3 ' end processing of mammalian pre - mRNAs by interacting with DSEF - 1 / hnRNPH / H ' protein ( 25 - 27).	[]
Members of the hnRNP H protein family recognize G - rich motifs capable of forming G - quadruplexes and are known to regulate polyadenylation and splicing events in mammalian transcripts ( 28 - 30).	[]
Regulated RNA processing is an essential component of differential gene expression which is central to many important biologically processes.	[]
More than half of human genes are known to have alternative polyadenylation ( 31).	"human	18	23	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Over two - thirds of human genes are thought to undergo alternative splicing ( 32).	"human	21	26	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Sequences capable of forming G - quadruplexes found in the vicinity of polyadenylation and splice sites act as regulators by interacting with hnRNP F and H proteins ( 25 - 27, 30, 33).	[]
Whether quadruplex structure directly plays a role in regulating RNA processing events requires investigation.	[]
Computational approaches to study G - quadruplexes in the mammalian genomes allow large - scale and detailed analysis of mammalian genes.	[]
Although, G - quadruplexes have been surveyed in the human genome with such techniques ( 34, 35), there are no known user - friendly computational tools easily accessible to the public.	"human	53	58	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We had previously built a database of mapped G - quadruplex sequences in selected alternatively processed human and mouse genes ( 36).	"human	106	111	Organism/Species"	"mouse	116	121	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Our preliminary analysis of the database suggests prevalence of such motifs near alternative splice and poly ( A) sites.	[]
We have now developed a web - based server, QGRS Mapper, that generates detailed information on composition and distribution of putative quadruplex forming G - rich sequences ( QGRS) in any NCBI nucleotide sequence identified or provided by the user.	[]
The program is also designed to handle the analysis of mammalian pre - mRNA sequences, including those that are alternatively processed ( alternatively spliced or alternatively polyadenylated).	[]
Researchers interested in predicting the ability of a nucleotide sequence to form G - quadruplex structure will find QGRS Mapper to be a user - friendly application that provides many options for analysis.	[]
The user can define the minimum number of tetrads, maximum length of the G - quadruplex motif, and size as well as composition of the loops.	[]
The program can map unimolecular QGRS in the entire nucleotide sequence provided in the raw or FASTA format by the user.	[]
This method can be used for the analysis of genomic sequences, e. g. promoter and telomeric regions, as well as RNA sequences.	[]
It is also useful for predicting G - quadruplex structures in oligonucleotides.	[]
Alternatively, the program provides options to search the entire NCBI Gene Entrez, RefSeq and GenBank databases in order to retrieve the desired gene / nucleotide sequence entries for analysis of their transcribed regions.	[]
Furthermore, QGRS Mapper is a unique tool for mapping G - quadruplex forming sequences in the context of RNA processing sites.	[]
This feature is very useful for investigating the functional relevance of G - quadruplex structure, in particular its role in regulating the gene expression by alternative processing.	[]
In addition to providing data on composition and locations of QGRS relative to the processing sites in the pre - mRNA sequence, QGRS Mapper offers interactive graphic representation of the data.	[]
The user can also use a graphics module to visualize QGRS distribution patterns among all the alternative RNA products of a gene simultaneously on a single screen.	[]
METHODS	[]
QGRS definition	[]
The main goal of the QGRS Mapper program is to predict the presence of QGRS in nucleotide entries.	[]
These putative G - quadruplexes are identified using the following motif.	[]
GxNy1GxNy2GxNy3Gx	[]
Here x = number of guanine tetrads in the G - quadruplex and y1, y2, y3 = length of gaps ( i. e. the length of the loops connecting the guanine tetrads).	[]
The motif consists of four equal length sets of guanines ( which we call G - groups), separated by arbitrary nucleotide sequences, with the following restrictions.	[]
The sequence must contain at least two tetrads ( i. e. x > = 2).	[]
Although structures with three or more G - tetrads are considered to be more stable, many nucleotide sequences are known to form quadruplexes with two G - tetrads ( 37, 38).	[]
QGRS Mapper is meant to be a flexible and comprehensive tool for investigating G - quadruplexes; hence it considers sequences with two tetrads. By default, only QGRS of maximum length of 30 bases are considered.	[]
However, the program gives the user the option to search for sequences up to 45 bases.	[]
This restriction on the length of the sequences being considered is in agreement with recent literature ( 34, 35).	[]
The maximum length of 30 bases restricts G - groups to a maximum size of 6. The gaps or loops between the G - groups may be arbitrary in composition or length ( within the overall restrictions on the length of QGRS).	[]
The program gives the user the option to search for QGRS having loops with a specified length range ( e. g. the user can search for QGRS with loops of lengths between 1 and 4).	[]
The user can also specify a string that one or more loops of each QGRS must contain.	[]
This string can be given as a regular expression.	[]
For example, entering the regular expression ' T { 3, 5} ' will search for QGRS having one or more loops that contain three to five consecutive T ' s. Also, at most one of the gaps is allowed to be of zero length	[]
Table 1 shows some examples of valid QGRS.	[]
The guanine groups which form the tetrads are underlined.	[]
The first sequence has four tetrads and equal length gaps.	[]
This would seem to provide a G - quadruplex that is the most stable of the three sequences.	[]
The second sequence is notable for the significant differences in the size of its loops.	[]
The third sequence has two tetrads, even though three of the G - groups could have included another G ( since all G - groups must be equal in size).	[]
G - scores	[]
We have devised a scoring system that evaluates a QGRS for its likelihood to form a stable G - quadruplex.	[]
Higher scoring sequences will make better candidates for G - quadruplexes.	[]
The scoring method uses the following principles which are based on previous studies ( 34, 35, 39 - 42).	[]
Shorter loops are more common than longer loops. G - quadruplexes tend to have loops roughly equal in size. The greater the number of guanine tetrads, the more stable the quadruplex.	[]
The computed G - scores are dependent on the user selected maximum QGRS length.	[]
The highest possible G - score, using the default maximum QGRS length of 30, is 105.	[]
Here is a sequence attaining that score:	[]
GGGGGGTGGGGGGTGGGGGG.	[]
Eliminating QGRS overlaps	[]
Two QGRS are said to overlap if their positions in the nucleotide sequence overlap.	[]
QGRS Mapper will start with a nucleotide sequence, find all QGRS occurring in the sequence and then produce a non - overlapping set of QGRS.	[]
Overlaps are eliminated by selecting the higher scoring QGRS.	[]
In the non - overlapping view, only this sequence will be displayed, although the user can request that all overlapping sequences be displayed.	[]
Please see supplementary materials at NAR online for more details on the elimination of overlapping QGRS.	[]
FEATURES	[]
Design and implementation	[]
QGRS Mapper is a web - based program, written in PHP, with Java being used for some of its graphics.	[]
The program takes a nucleotide sequence from NCBI ( or as provided by the user) and analyzes it for the presence of putative G - quadruplexes.	[]
The structure of QGRS Mapper is summarized in Table 2.	[]
Search and analysis	[]
QGRS Mapper allows the user to search for putative G - quadruplexes in a variety of ways.	[]
It is possible to enter a nucleotide sequence in raw or FASTA format for analysis.	[]
One can search and analyze gene sequences by Gene ID, Gene name or symbol, accession number or GI number for an NCBI nucleotide sequence entry.	[]
The user can opt to change the maximum length of QGRS that will be searched for ( the default maximum length being 30) and change the minimum sized G - group ( which is two by default).	[]
Also, the user can specify that the loops in the QGRS fall within a given size range and that one or more loops of the QGRS contain a given string ( for which the user may enter a regular expression).	[]
The web page for QGRS analysis can be seen in Figure 1.	[]
After entering a sequence in raw or FASTA format, QGRS Mapper will search the sequence for occurrences of QGRS.	[]
The user may enter any combination of the letters A, C, T, G, U, N.	[]
The Gene ID field allows the user to search the NCBI Entrez Gene database.	[]
QGRS Mapper will connect to NCBI, download and parse the gene entry, and then analyze the transcribed region of its nucleotide sequence for the presence of QGRS.	[]
For example, entering the gene ID 403437 results in downloading the Brca1 gene sequence for Canis familiaris.	"Canis familiaris	92	108	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Canis familiaris"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Using the default QGRS search parameters, QGRS Mapper finds 156 non - overlapping QGRS and 3394 overlapping QGRS in the transcribed region of this gene.	[]
The Gene Name or Gene Symbol field also allows the user to search the NCBI databases for all such genes.	[]
Entering the gene name Bcl2 results in nine different hits which are displayed in Table 3.	[]
All nine of these entries can be analyzed for the occurrence of QGRS.	[]
Clicking on the Gene ID takes the user to the respective Entrez Gene entry.	[]
Clicking on the last column initiates analysis of the selection by QGRS Mapper.	[]
Similarly, the user can also enter an NCBI accession number to search for gene sequences.	[]
For example, searching the accession number AF312033 results in 12 hits being displayed for this GenBank nucleotide sequence entry.	[]
The search phase of the program is followed by an analysis of the QGRS contained in the query sequence.	[]
In this phase of QGRS Mapper, the sequence data downloaded previously is analyzed to identify and map all QGRS relative to locations such as splice sites in exons / introns, and poly ( A) site ( if these locations are known).	[]
Furthermore the QGRS are scored by the method described above.	[]
The computed G - score is used to eliminate overlapping QGRS.	[]
At times, QGRS Mapper must analyze a considerable amount of data.	[]
For example, the mouse version of the gene PTPRU, which is 69822 bases long, contains 94681 QGRS of length up to 45 bases.	"mouse	17	22	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
QGRS Mapper will find, analyze and map all of these sequences.	[]
During this analysis a message is displayed indicating the estimated time left to completion.	[]
QGRS Mapper output	[]
After the analysis of overlaps is completed, QGRS Mapper displays a summary of its findings, in the Gene View.	[]
This summary includes basic gene information such as the gene ID, gene symbol, gene name, a link to the NCBI entry, organism name, chromosome number and number of products and poly ( A) signals.	[]
Information is also given for each product, such as the number of exons and introns, number of QGRS ( non - overlapping and overlapping), number of QGRS found near RNA processing sites, and a visual map of the product.	[]
As an example, the Gene View for the human GREB1 is displayed in Figure 2, showing the table of gene information and product information for the first product ( the output for all products may be seen in the supplementary material).	"human	37	42	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
At this stage in the analysis the user can choose among three further displays: ' Data View ', ' Data View ( with overlaps) ' and ' Graphics View '.	[]
This can be done for the entire gene or for any particular product.	[]
In the Data View, a table is displayed showing information for each of the set of non - overlapping QGRS.	[]
This table displays the position of the QGRS, which exon / intron it appears in, its distance from 3 ' and 5 ' splice sites, the QGRS sequence ( with each G - group underlined) and the corresponding G - score.	[]
Similar display is also shown for each QGRS mapped to poly ( A) region in the product.	[]
If the user requests the Data View for the entire gene, then the QGRS information is shown for each product.	[]
The ' Data View ( with overlaps) ' gives the same information but shows the locations of all QGRS.	[]
Figure 3 shows the Data View for product 1 of the GREB1 gene.	[]
The user can also choose the Graphics View to give a visual display of the location of QGRS.	[]
This allows the user to see the location of QGRS relative to exons and introns ( if that information is available).	[]
The Graphics View has the following components.	[]
A graphic display of the entire gene ( showing the location of the exons).	[]
This display includes a sliding window that can be used to focus on any particular segment of the gene.	[]
This window may be dragged to the left or right to change position within the gene. A magnified view of the fragment of the gene within the sliding window. A graph showing the location of QGRS within the fragment, with each QGRS being displayed by a bar whose height represents its G - score. A vertical slider that allows the user to change the size of the window.	[]
This allows the user to zoom in or out on any part of the gene.	[]
The sliding window on the gene expands or contracts as one zooms in or out.	[]
It is possible to see the nucleotide sequence of the product at maximum zoom levels.	[]
The Graphics View for the entire gene shows the G - score graph together with an exon / intron map for each product.	[]
This allows the user to visually compare the location of QGRS for each product relative to that of splice sites.	[]
The Graphics View for the first product of the GREB1 gene is represented in Figure 4.	[]
The Graphics View for the entire GREB1 gene may be seen in the Supplementary Data.	[]
CONCLUSIONS	[]
QGRS Mapper is a user - friendly web - based server that provides computational tools for prediction of Quadruplex forming G - rich sequences in the nucleotide sequences identified or provided by the user.	[]
The program offers many options, including user - defined composition of the quadruplex.	[]
It can analyze DNA or RNA sequence provided by the user in the raw or FASTA format.	[]
The application also provides tools for searching and retrieving gene / nucleotide entries from a variety of NCBI databases.	[]
There are several options for data output format, including an interactive graphic module.	[]
Researchers interested in evaluating the ability of nucleotide sequences to form unimolecular G - quadruplexes will find QGRS Mapper to be very useful.	[]
Owing to the flexible and comprehensive nature of the design, it is expected to serve a variety of scientists.	[]
The application will be especially attractive to individuals interested in exploring the role of G - quadruplexes in regulated RNA processing.	[]
We are using the server to perform a large - scale analysis of alternatively processed mammalian transcripts.	[]
We are particularly interested in studying the composition and distribution patterns of G - quadruplexes in the transcribed regions of mammalian genes.	[]

Drug information resources used by nurse practitioners and collaborating physicians at the point of care in Nova Scotia, Canada: a survey and review of the literature	[]
Abstract	[]
Background	[]
Keeping current with drug therapy information is challenging for health care practitioners.	[]
Technologies are often implemented to facilitate access to current and credible drug information sources.	[]
In the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, legislation was passed in 2002 to allow nurse practitioners ( NPs) to practice collaboratively with physician partners.	[]
The purpose of this study was to determine the current utilization patterns of information technologies by these groups of practitioners.	[]
Methods	[]
Nurse practitioners and their collaborating physician partners in Nova Scotia were sent a survey in February 2005 to determine the frequency of use, usefulness, accessibility, credibility, and current / timeliness of personal digital assistant ( PDA), computer, and print drug information resources.	[]
Two surveys were developed ( one for PDA users and one for computer users) and revised based on a literature search, stakeholder consultation, and pilot - testing results.	[]
A second distribution to nonresponders occurred two weeks following the first.	[]
Data were entered and analysed with SPSS.	[]
Results	[]
Twenty - seven ( 14 NPs and 13 physicians) of 36 ( 75%) recipients responded.	[]
22% ( 6) returned personal digital assistant ( PDA) surveys.	[]
Respondents reported print, health professionals, and online / electronic resources as the most to least preferred means to access drug information, respectively.	[]
"37% and 35% of respondents reported using "" both print and electronic but print more than electronic "" and "" print only "", respectively, to search monograph - related drug information queries whereas 4% reported using "" PDA only ""."	[]
Analysis of respondent ratings for all resources in the categories print, health professionals and other, and online / electronic resources, indicated that the Compendium of Pharmaceuticals and Specialties and pharmacists ranked highly for frequency of use, usefulness, accessibility, credibility, and current / timeliness by both groups of practitioners.	[]
Respondents ' preferences and resource ratings were consistent with self - reported methods for conducting drug information queries.	[]
Few differences existed between NP and physician rankings of resources.	[]
Conclusion	[]
The use of computers and PDAs remains limited, which is also consistent with preferred and frequent use of print resources.	[]
Education for these practitioners regarding available electronic drug information resources may facilitate future computer and PDA use.	[]
Further research is needed to determine methods to increase computer and PDA use and whether these technologies affect prescribing and patient outcomes.	"patient	135	142	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Background	[]
Challenges with knowledge management for health care professionals	[]
"In 1986, Haynes et al. published a series of 6 articles entitled "" how to keep up with the medical literature "" in an effort to help clinicians with information management, but this challenge has not decreased in last two decades [ 1 - 6]."	[]
"Alper et al. suggest that maintaining currency with relevant literature in primary care would "" require 627. 5 hours per month, or about 29 hours per weekday, or 3. 6 full - time equivalents of physician effort "" [ 7]."	[]
The volume of information associated with keeping up to date is frequently cited as a barrier [ 8].	[]
It is estimated that annually there are approximately 10, 000 new randomized trials in MEDLINE and over 450, 000 clinical trials identified by the Cochrane Collaboration [ 9, 10].	[]
Keeping up to date has been described with several analogies including clinicians attempting to drink water from a fire hose and swimming in rivers of clinical research with unprecedented depth, velocity, and turbulence [ 11, 12].	[]
Difficulties with dissemination of research evidence and keeping up to date on pharmacotherapeutic interventions are reported despite the development of tools such as clinical practice guidelines and systematic reviews that are intended to reduce the need for practitioners to evaluate original research [ 13].	[]
To complicate matters further, there are often issues of credibility, timeliness, and volume of clinical practice guidelines and reviews.	[]
Many guidelines are criticized for their methodological development.	[]
Shaneyfelt et al. reviewed 279 guidelines for methodological standards from peer reviewed medical literature [ 14].	[]
These authors found that only 51%, 33. 6%, and 46% adhered to standards on guideline development and format, evidence identification and summary, and formulation of recommendations, respectively [ 14].	[]
A Canadian review on drug therapy guidelines found significant variation in quality depending on the developer [ 13].	[]
Approximately 25% of guidelines were not recommended for use in practice by the appraisers ' criteria [ 13].	[]
As an example of the volume of clinical practice guidelines available, eleven recent guidelines on community acquired pneumonia exist [ 15].	[]
To add to the complexities involved with keeping current with pharmacotherapeutic management strategies, as of 2000, there were over 22, 000 drug products approved for sale in Canada for human use [ 16].	"human	187	192	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 187, ""end_span"": 192, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
"There is also considerable debate regarding what constitutes "" evidence "" in practice, which contributes to confusion for clinicians [ 17, 18]."	[]
Sim et al. succinctly describe the gap between evidence and action as difficulties with obtaining, systematically reviewing, applying in context, and measuring the outcome following application of evidence [ 19].	[]
Maintaining competence - nurse practitioners as a new group of prescribers	[]
Competencies for nurse practitioners ( NPs) on a local and international level include critically appraising and applying literature and research findings in practice [ 20 - 23].	[]
The Canadian Nurses Association ( CNA) has developed the Canadian Nurse Practitioner Core Competency Framework that describes the knowledge, skills, judgment, and attributes required for practice.	[]
Evidence based practice is integral to pharmacotherapeutic interventions and prescribing competencies [ 23].	[]
The National Prescribing Centre, an organization of the National Health Service in the UK, describes several competencies around information needs relevant to prescribing and emphasis is placed on using relevant and up to date information in various formats ( e. g. print, electronic, verbal).	[]
Several related competencies include understanding advantages and disadvantages of information sources and the currency of resources [ 21].	[]
Researchers in the US developed NP informatics competencies for integration into advanced nursing practice curricula [ 24].	[]
Competencies related to informatics knowledge include critical analysis of data and information for use in evidence based practice, evaluating and applying relevant information, synthesizing best evidence, and using optimal search strategies to locate clinically sound and useful studies from information resources [ 24].	[]
Achieving and maintaining competence in these domains as well as a solid foundation in pharmacology is necessary to support NPs in their relatively new role as a prescriber [ 25 - 27].	[]
Knowledge management and information seeking behaviours among nurse practitioners and physicians	[]
Information seeking behaviours of physicians are better documented than NPs [ 11].	[]
Information related to diagnosis is important to both groups but drug therapy queries may occur more frequently with NPs [ 28 - 33].	[]
Research on nurses ' behaviours related to information seeking is available from the hospital setting [ 33 - 35] but the generalizability of these behaviours to NPs with a prescribing role is unclear.	[]
Differences in nursing roles, responsibilities, and legislation, including prescriptive authority, exist depending on the country of practice.	[]
Nurse practitioners and their collaborating physician partners in Nova Scotia	[]
Nova Scotia is a Canadian province with a population of approximately 942, 000 [ 36].	[]
The province is divided into six health zones that include nine district health authorities, one of which includes the provincial capital and is considered to be urban [ 37, 38].	[]
Health care service delivery is challenging due to many factors including the rural nature of the province, which is estimated to be 60% of population [ 37, 39].	[]
Starting in 1998, the Nova Scotia Department of Health led an initiative to explore different methods of delivering, managing, and funding primary care services.	[]
The Strengthening Primary Care in Nova Scotia Communities Initiative ( SPCI) was established with the selection of four primary care demonstration sites where a primary health care NP was hired to practice collaboratively with one or more family / general physicians and other members of an interdisciplinary team.	[]
Each demonstration site adopted alternative ( non fee - for - service) physician payment mechanisms and used electronic patient records ( EPRs) to support service delivery [ 41].	"patient	120	127	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Demonstration sites participated in project evaluation components that included, but were not limited to, NP roles, alternative fee structures, consumer satisfaction, and implementation and integration of EPRs [ 41, 42].	[]
Legislation to allow NPs to practice collaboratively with physicians in Nova Scotia was passed in 2002, part way through the SPCI project [ 39].	[]
Prescriptive authority granted through legislation authorizes NPs to prescribe from a schedule of drugs [ 43, 44].	[]
At the time of conducting this research project, 16 primary health care NPs were in active practice [ 43].	[]
The EPR component of the SPCI project evaluation provided information on the use of technologies in the community context.	[]
Results from the implementation process indicated that considerable attention is required for technology literacy, time for training, and selection of software for EPRs [ 41].	[]
Although the majority of community - based, non - institutional clinical practice settings in Nova Scotia primarily operate with paper - based charting systems, there is a movement toward integrating electronic technologies, including the EPR, in practice among health care providers, administrators, and the provincial government.	[]
In addition to recording patient visit information, a component of the EPR package serves to provide drug information resources.	"patient	25	32	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Drug therapy information resources for NPs and nurse prescribers have frequently been described as essential in supporting practice [ 25, 28, 29].	[]
The role of NPs is relatively new in Canada [ 39] and there is limited information available to indicate the type of resources ( e. g. print, electronic, EPR based) these prescribers use for drug and therapeutic information queries at the point of care.	[]
It is unknown as to whether differences exist regarding types of resources used, drug information needs, and utilization patterns among NPs and collaborating physician partners.	[]
Some research has suggested that the degree of multidisciplinary team functioning relates to the adoption of technology or innovations in practice but more research is required to determine the extent of these relationships [ 45, 46].	[]
The use of EPR technology is increasing in Nova Scotia but little information is available regarding the readiness of practitioners for use of specific features such as drug information resources.	[]
Based on the EPR related results of the SPCI evaluation, use of these functions could be challenging without proper facilitation.	[]
The purpose of the survey for this research was to describe drug information resources used by NPs and their collaborating physician partners at the point of care.	[]
The results of the survey will be used to guide further technology implementation strategies and stimulate further discussion around drug information resource usage at the point of care.	[]
Methods	[]
Survey development	[]
Survey development involved three stages including identification of important content areas, development of draft questions, and survey refinement.	[]
Identifying important content areas for inclusion in the survey involved conducting a comprehensive English language literature search, consultation with relevant stakeholders ( e. g. members of the Nova Scotia Department of Health), and input from subject matter experts at Dalhousie University.	[]
The literature review was conducted using the following bibliographic databases: PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature ( CINAHL), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts ( IPA), and Web of Science Citation Databases.	[]
Hand and electronic searching of relevant journals was also conducted.	[]
Broad search terms were used without limits on publication date or place as nurse practitioner titles, roles and scopes of practice, and terminology regarding technology vary nationally and internationally.	[]
Some examples of terms used included nurse practitioner, nurse prescriber, nurse clinicians, district nurse, health visitor, drug information resources, drug information services, information needs, and information technology.	[]
The draft survey was reviewed by the research team to reduce the number of items and improve clarity.	[]
The layout of the questionnaire was carefully examined to ensure that it was easy to follow and complete.	[]
Research results from a previous investigation of Nova Scotian physicians ' behaviours regarding drug information were also used to further revise the survey [ 47].	[]
This draft questionnaire was pilot tested by two out of province NPs and one physician.	[]
The results of the pilot were used to make final revisions to the survey.	[]
Based on pilot - testing feedback and investigator consensus, the final survey was divided into 2 versions, one for personal digital assistant ( PDA) users and one for computer users.	[]
The 10 page surveys for PDA and computer users had 5 or 6 sections, respectively, and 37 questions, many with multiple parts.	[]
The survey content included demographics, computer or PDA use and experience, drug and therapeutic resource use and preferences, PDA future use, perceived barriers and facilitators to PDA use, and technology training preferences.	[]
Section one contained demographic questions such as gender, age, job title, volume of patients, and EPR availability in the practice setting.	"patients	86	94	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Section two was designed to determine PDA or computer use and experience in the practice setting with questions regarding length of use, costs, and work versus home usage.	[]
This section also addressed usage and rating of different drug information resources.	[]
Resource ratings were based on the frequency of usage, usefulness, accessibility, credibility, and current / timeliness.	[]
Resources were grouped as print ( i. e. books, journals, and clinical practice guidelines), online / electronic resources, and health professionals and other.	[]
Respondents used 5 - point Likert scales ( strongly agree to strongly disagree) for rating opinions related to resources.	[]
A rating of 6 ( not applicable, I do not use this resource) was also included for respondents who did not use a particular resource.	[]
Frequency of searching for specific information was rated on a 3 - point Likert scale ( frequently to never).	[]
The final sections of the survey included categorical, open - ended, and Likert scale questions regarding preferred resources, technology barriers, PDA future use, and technology training preferences.	[]
Copies of the surveys are attached as an appendix in PDF format [ see additional file 1 and 2] or can also be accessed from the Initiative for Medication Management, Policy Analysis, Research & Training ( IMPART) website [ 48].	[]
Ethics approval for the survey was granted through Dalhousie University Research Ethics Board on February 3, 2005.	[]
Survey population	[]
Licensed, actively practicing, primary health care NPs ( n = 16) and their collaborating physician partners ( n = 21) were eligible to participate.	[]
Survey procedures	[]
The survey recruitment procedures were based on the methods of Dillman [ 49] and Salant and Dillman [ 50].	[]
Survey packages contained a cover letter, separate surveys for PDA and computer users, and a return self - addressed stamped envelope.	[]
The covering letter instructed respondents to self - select the appropriate survey ( either PDA or computer) based on their drug information seeking behaviours.	[]
Participants who had used a PDA at any time were instructed to complete the PDA version of the survey.	"Participants	0	12	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Participants"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Those who had never used a PDA for drug information were instructed to complete the computer version of the survey.	[]
Several strategies were used to optimize response rate and included: personalized cover letters, coloured paper for surveys, stamped return envelopes, follow - up mailing, and a priority post mailing [ 51].	[]
The covering letter included coloured logos of Dalhousie University and the Nova Scotia Department of Health representing the investigator affiliations and endorsement of the project.	[]
A master mailing list with names and addresses of NPs and their collaborating physician partners was created.	[]
To maintain confidentiality of respondents, a number placed on the bottom right corner of each survey corresponded to a name on the confidential master mailing sheet.	[]
The postage paid return envelopes were addressed to the research coordinator at the School of Nursing, Dalhousie University, who matched respondents to the mailing list from the first distribution.	[]
The cross - referenced mailing list was not accessible to those entering or analysing data.	[]
The research coordinator sent the second distribution to those who had not initially responded.	[]
A fluorescent coloured page was included in the second mailing to notify recipients of the second and final mailing status.	[]
The second mailing followed 2 weeks after the initial mailing ( February 2005).	[]
The surveys were sent via Xpresspost ( TM) through Canada Post.	[]
Data analyses	[]
Quantitative	[]
Data were entered and analysed in Statistical Package for Social Sciences ( SPSS) ( version 11. 5 for Windows).	[]
Five surveys were randomly selected as a check for accuracy of data entry.	[]
Descriptive statistics were used to describe resource usage by practitioners.	[]
Chi Square ( Fisher ' s Exact when cell count less than 5) analyses were used to determine differences in computer or PDA use based on predetermined variables ( e. g. high speed Internet connection, number of patients per day).	"patients	209	217	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 209, ""end_span"": 217, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Mann Whitney U tests were used to compare physician and NPs Likert scale ratings ( 1 = strongly agree to 5 = strongly disagree) of resource use.	[]
Physician and NP rankings of all resources ( print, online / electronic, and health professionals and other) were determined from means of Likert scale ratings ( 1 = strongly agree, 5 = strongly disagree) for each of the pre - specified characteristics ( e. g. frequency of use, accessibility, etc.) and the frequency of use of the resources.	[]
The best rankings were assigned for the lowest mean scores and the largest number of the sample using a resource.	[]
These rankings ( ranks based on mean and ranks based on sample) were then entered into a formula to calculate an overall rank.	[]
The formula includes: rank = [ ( rank according to% of sample using the resource + rank based on mean score) / 2].	[]
This formula was used to account for mean scores based on small samples as these numbers could potentially over or underestimate the value of a resource.	[]
Ratings of 6 ( i. e. not applicable, I do not use this resource) were excluded from the analyses.	[]
Qualitative	[]
Comments were entered in a word - processing program and organized by type of respondent ( PDA versus computer) and question number.	[]
The coded survey number and respondent type ( NP or physician) were also included next to comments.	[]
Investigators determined themes and categorized comments based on previous experience, knowledge, and familiarity with the topic.	[]
Results	[]
Surveys were completed and returned by 75% of eligible participants ( 27 of 36).	"participants	55	67	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""participants"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
One physician survey was undeliverable.	[]
The response rates from within the NP and physician samples were 88% and 65%, respectively.	[]
Complete demographic information is available in Table 1.	[]
Methods for accessing resources and self - reported resource use	[]
Resource use was similar amongst practitioners.	[]
Respondents indicated that print resources ( mean 4. 56, SD 0. 80), health professionals ( mean 3. 26, SD 0. 90), and online / electronic resources ( mean 2. 70, SD 1. 20) were the preferred method ( 1 = least preferred to 5 = most preferred) for accessing drug information.	[]
Thirty - seven percent of respondents reported that searching for specific questions related to drug information ( e. g. usual dosage, duration of therapy) was conducted using both print and electronic resources ( but print use greater than electronic) ( Table 2).	[]
The preferred means ( i. e. print) to access resources was consistent with the most common means of conducting searches for specific drug information queries.	[]
Respondents ' ratings for pre - specified print, online / electronic, and professional resources and other, based on means from Likert scales and number of respondents using the resources, are presented in Tables 3, 4, and 5.	[]
Of all resources within the print, online / electronic, and health professionals or other categories, NPs and physicians rated the Compendium of Pharmaceuticals and Specialties ( CPS) [ 52] and pharmacists as the top two most frequently used resources for providing drug and therapeutic information.	[]
Physicians rated other physicians as the third most frequently used resource.	[]
The book Therapeutic Choices [ 53] ranked third for NPs.	[]
Based on written feedback, physicians and NPs consulted pharmacists and other physicians most frequently.	[]
The CPS and pharmacists were also ranked as the top two resources overall in terms of usefulness, accessibility, credibility, and current / timeliness for physicians.	[]
Rankings by NPs were similar for usefulness, accessibility, and credibility.	[]
NPs ranked pharmacists, Therapeutic Choices, and academic detailing first and the CPS as second for current / timeliness.	[]
Within the online / electronic category, electronic clinical practice guidelines ( eCPGs) were rated the highest for all characteristics ( e. g. usefulness, credibility).	[]
Although eCPGs were highly ranked, approximately 30% of the sample reported not using this resource.	[]
Other resources in this category were infrequently used based on respondents ' self - reports.	[]
Pharmaceutical industry representatives were used as a source of drug information by 85% and 86% of physicians and NPs, respectively ( Table 5).	[]
This was higher than regional drug information services ( used by 23% of physicians and 50% of NPs).	[]
After exclusion of traditional health professionals ( i. e. physicians, nurses, pharmacists, allied health) in the health professionals and other category, pharmaceutical industry representatives received rankings for second or third for frequency of use, usefulness, accessibility, credibility, and current / timeliness, based on means and number of respondents using this resource ( data not shown).	[]
Differences between nurse practitioners and physicians	[]
A series of Mann Whitney U tests were used to compare the responses of NPs and physicians on their use of print, online / electronic, and health professional resources.	[]
In total 95 statistical tests were conducted.	[]
The large number of tests increases the likelihood of a type I error as five significant differences would be expected by chance alone at an alpha threshold of 0. 05.	[]
It is therefore important to treat these results with caution.	[]
A limited number of statistically significant ( p < 0. 05) differences were identified between physicians and NPs and are reported in Table 6.	[]
Therapeutic Choices differed significantly for frequency of use with more NPs making use of this resource.	[]
Allied health professionals significantly differed between NPs and physicians for accessibility and current / timeliness while NPs were more in agreement with these characteristics of the resource.	[]
Nurse colleague credibility and current / timeliness was rated significantly higher by NPs versus physicians.	[]
Factors influencing electronic technology use at the point of care	[]
Factors such as gender, age, practitioner type ( NP vs physician), accessibility, technical support, Internet connection speed, patient volume, presence of an EPR, and home computer use were examined to determine if they were associated with the use of a work computer to search for drug information at the point of care.	"patient	128	135	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
No statistically significant associations were found ( Fisher ' s Exact).	[]
Additional resources from respondent comments	[]
Respondents indicated other resources and programs, such as clinical calculators, that they would like to access from their computer or PDA.	[]
The top three resources that were desired included Canadian clinical practice guidelines, patient education information, and ability to track clinical activities / statistics.	"patient	90	97	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Further comments from two NP computer survey respondents revealed that a resource on drug interactions and dosages would be desired.	[]
"One other NP also indicated "" up to date info [ sic] on drugs to treat various illnesses ie doseage [ sic], length of use etc. """	[]
Computer or personal digital assistant use in practice	[]
Approximately 50% of computer survey respondents reported using their work computers for searching drug or therapeutic information related to patient care.	"patient	142	149	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Of those respondents, just over half ( 54%) also reported using their home computer for this purpose.	[]
Sixty - seven and 17% of PDA survey respondents reported using their PDA for searching drug or therapeutic information related to patient care at work and home, respectively.	"patient	130	137	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Searching on a weekly basis for specific information related to drugs	[]
Of the 24 specified categories of drug information included in the survey, the majority were reported as infrequently searched and a smaller percentage as never searched by respondents ( data not shown).	[]
The top three categories rated as frequently searched were side effects, adult or usual drug dosage, and most appropriate drug for an indication.	[]
( Table 7)	[]
Issues related to personal digital assistants	[]
Respondents reported their level of agreement with statements related to how PDAs may influence their practice.	[]
The statements included aspects of workload ( organization and paper work), convenience, and improving quality of care and patient outcomes.	"patient	123	130	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
( Table 8) Respondents agreed that PDAs are a convenient resource but indicated that PDAs would not decrease paperwork or improve patient health outcomes.	"patient	130	137	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Barriers and facilitators to personal digital assistants: themes from written comments	[]
Peer support from colleagues, convenience, standardized usage, and financial and technical support were the main perceived facilitators to PDA use reported by respondents.	[]
The main perceived barrier to PDA use reported by respondents ( n = 10) included cost.	[]
Other factors such as technology literacy, time, lack of peer support, no high speed internet for downloads, lack of needed resources, keeping up to date on resources, and searching speed were also reported.	[]
Future use of personal digital assistants	[]
Fifty - two percent, including current PDA users, reported that they would use a PDA in the future.	[]
Twenty two percent were uncertain and 19% reported that they would not use a PDA in the future.	[]
Two people did not respond.	"people	4	10	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""people"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Confidentiality	[]
Fifty two percent of respondents indicated that patient confidentiality with PDAs was no more concerning compared to use of other technologies.	"patient	48	55	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Forty - four percent did not know if they had a policy on patient confidentiality with regard to technologies.	"patient	58	65	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Technology training and reimbursement	[]
Respondents rated ( 1 = least preferred to 5 = most preferred) one on one instruction and group learning led by an expert facilitator as the most preferred ( mean 4. 32, SD 0. 99) means by which to receive instruction on a new technology.	[]
Least preferred methods included online discussions / chatrooms ( mean 1. 52, SD 1. 04), internet videos ( live: mean 1. 70, SD 1. 10, or static: mean 1. 87, SD 1. 14), video cassettes ( mean 2. 30, SD 1. 55), trial and error learning ( mean 2. 32, SD 1. 28), and written manuals ( mean 2. 92, SD 1. 44).	[]
Paid leave for attendance at technology training sessions was the preferred means ( mean 1. 77, SD 0. 86; 1 = strongly agree to 5 = strongly disagree) of remuneration for respondents.	[]
Respondents also indicated that if financial remuneration was to occur, it should correspond to the amount of time for training that is required ( versus a flat rate) ( mean 1. 96, SD 1. 08).	[]
Continuing education credits were not viewed as an incentive ( mean 2. 69, SD 1. 44).	[]
Discussion	[]
Preferred resources	[]
In our study, printed materials ( e. g. compendia, journals, textbook resources) and professionals ( e. g. pharmacists) were the most preferred and frequently used means to access information.	[]
Physician reliance on text and compendia relative to online / electronic resources has been frequently reported [ 11].	[]
In a study examining family doctors ' use of information sources to answer clinical questions, human resources ( e. g. doctor, pharmacist), non - prescribing print information ( e. g. textbooks and journal articles), and prescribing texts were used 36%, 32%, and 25% of the time, respectively [ 54].	"human	95	100	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Books from the workplace were reported by approximately 79% of UK primary care nurses as a commonly used source of knowledge and information used to support practice [ 55].	[]
Fewer than one - third ( 31%) reported using electronic resources ( e. g. Internet, electronic journals) for this purpose [ 55].	[]
Results of a postal questionnaire to NPs demonstrated that 61% and 51% of respondents reported using drug reference manuals and textbooks, respectively, a few times a week or more [ 29].	[]
These frequencies were second and third only to consulting with their physician supervisor ( 63%).	[]
Data from structured interviews of a sample of 22 community nurse prescribers reported by Hall et al. revealed that the majority relied on print materials to access information, namely the British National Formulary [ 32].	[]
A survey of a primary care practice - based research network in the US that included physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners, revealed that interpersonal and rapidly accessed print resources were preferred.	[]
Sixty - one and 58% of respondents reported using drug reference sources such as the Physician ' s Desk Reference ( PDR) and medical textbooks, respectively, a few times a day or daily [ 56].	[]
The clinicians in our sample perceived the Canadian compendium, the CPS, to be useful, accessible, credible, and current / timely.	[]
"The CPS, is described as "" the Canadian drug reference for health professionals "" and is intended to provide a central source of drug information on drug products available in Canada [ 52]."	[]
It is available in print ( English and French) and became available online in June 2004.	[]
The CPS includes drug monographs for commonly used products approved for use in Canada, but it does not include all drugs available on the Canadian market [ 57].	[]
The majority of these product monographs are based on monographs submitted by pharmaceutical manufacturers and approved by Health Canada.	[]
Some of the monographs are written by the Canadian Pharmacists Association and are described as being evidence - based [ 52].	[]
The CPS also includes more than 100 pages of clinical tools [ 52].	[]
The CPS has been criticized for including pharmaceutical company advertising and requiring manufacturer payment for inclusion of product monographs [ 58].	[]
The accuracy of particular components of CPS monographs has also been investigated.	[]
A review of overdose management in 119 monographs from the 2001 CPS revealed considerable variability in the utility of information with 50% of the monographs containing misleading or dangerous advice [ 59].	[]
Since 2004, the CPS has included an alert box in the overdose section of monographs notifying users to contact Poison Control Centres for overdose management information.	[]
Some authors have criticized references that are similar to the CPS as being inadequate with regard to inclusion of evidence based information [ 60].	[]
The NPs in our sample also rated Therapeutic Choices highly for all characteristics.	[]
This finding is most likely attributable to the fact that it is a recommended resource for coursework associated with the Dalhousie NP university program curriculum.	[]
Therapeutic Choices is a concise therapeutics reference text published by the Canadian Pharmacists Association.	[]
The text contains approximately 120 extensively referenced chapters with a disease management approach including easy to use algorithms and tables.	[]
An editorial board is responsible for extensively reviewing the content to ensure unbiased and objective information is presented [ 53].	[]
Health professionals	[]
Reliance on other health professionals, especially pharmacists and physicians, as a resource for information was evident from our study and concurs with the findings of others [ 28, 32, 55, 61].	[]
Nurse practitioners have reported that collaborative relationships with pharmacists increase NP role satisfaction [ 61].	[]
NPs frequently consult with allied health care professionals in their primary health care provider role and this is supported by written feedback from our sample regarding frequently consulted health professionals.	[]
Nursing colleagues are also likely to be rated highly by NPs due to their affiliation with peers from the same profession.	[]
Some investigators have shown that non - human references ( e. g. textbook) are sought for more technical aspects of prescribing ( e. g. dose), whereas guidance regarding selection of agents ( i. e. right drug for an indication) is sought from human resources ( e. g. pharmacists or physicians) [ 62].	"human	41	46	Organism/Species"	"human	41	46	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We were unable to determine what kinds of resources were used for specific purposes from our study.	[]
Online and electronic resources, computers, and personal digital assistants	[]
From our study, computer survey respondents ranked online / electronic resources third in preference following print and health professionals.	[]
Various barriers and facilitators to accessing information online / electronically or via the Internet have been described in the literature [ 55, 63 - 66].	[]
Variables that have been described by others as barriers such as accessibility, high speed internet access, patient volume, age, practitioner type, and technology support did not appear to influence computer searching for information on drugs or therapeutics related to patient care in our results.	"patient	108	115	Organism/Species"	"patient	108	115	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Some qualitative feedback does however support this notion.	[]
"As an example, in response to a request for a rationale for not using computers one physician commented: "" Retro tech [ sic] / old fashion."	[]
"I still like to use my mind and have always been a fan of pen and paper ""."	[]
Barriers that were identified with our sample regarding the use of handheld technologies such as PDAs included cost, time, and issues related to technology literacy.	[]
Several people questioned the value of PDAs.	"people	8	14	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""people"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
"One GP stated when referring to a PDA: "" So far I have not discovered a use for one ""."	[]
Other respondents reinforced their preferences for other resources ( e. g. books) and resistance to technology.	[]
"When responding to barriers for the use of PDAs, one NP commented, "" My huge dislike for machinery that frequently requires updating and patience ""."	[]
"A physician responded, "" as stated, I like to use my own mind, and can get all the info I need from books relatively quickly ""."	[]
Facilitators to the use of PDAs mainly included convenience factors such as having resources all in one place, faster means to get information, and portability.	[]
Our sample was not in agreement with some convenience factors in that they did not feel that PDAs would decrease paperwork.	[]
Practitioners from our sample felt relatively neutral about PDAs improving patient ' s health outcomes with 41% responding in this manner.	"patient	75	82	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Results from a sample of primary care practitioners in the US revealed that 76% agreed that the use of handheld devices for electronic prescribing would substantially reduce medical errors and improve the quality of health care [ 67].	[]
Our study also suggests that resources such as the Cochrane Library and its Database of Systematic Reviews were not frequently used.	[]
This finding is similar to that of other investigators [ 30, 35, 64].	[]
Despite the desire of some clinicians to use these resources, lack of confidence and ability to use them appropriately has been found [ 30, 64, 68, 69].	[]
Our study suggests that although this resource is perceived as credible, current / timely, and useful, it is also perceived to be somewhat inaccessible.	[]
The Cochrane Library is available to the health professionals ( e. g. nurses, physicians, pharmacists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, etc.) in our sample through professional bodies via the Atlantic Health Knowledge Partnership [ 70].	[]
Technology training: preferences and incentives	[]
With regard to receiving training for a new technology, our study demonstrates that in person conferences or one on one training sessions are the preferred means to receive continuing education.	"person	87	93	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""person"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Person to person interaction has been reported as the preferred and most frequently used means to access continuing education or training by other investigators [ 55, 71].	"Person	0	6	Organism/Species"	"person	10	16	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Person"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 6, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""person"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Our study also indicates that this group of practitioners may benefit from accessing resources [ 72 - 80] that provide guidance on useful drug information resources available for devices such as PDAs.	[]
"This is exemplified by one respondent ' s statement "" knowledge regarding good software programs "" as a barrier to the use of PDAs."	[]
Pharmaceutical industry	[]
The influence of the pharmaceutical industry on physician prescribing and research outcomes has been documented [ 81, 82].	[]
Although NP use of industry representatives as a source of pharmacological information has been documented, the influence on prescribing is largely uninvestigated [ 32, 61, 83 - 85].	[]
The CNA competency framework includes a statement regarding prescribing and industry relations [ 23].	[]
In our study, the physician and NP rankings of industry representatives were similar.	[]
Within the health professionals and other category, pharmaceutical representatives were used as a resource by more of the sample than regional drug information services and comparably to academic detailing services.	[]
Academic detailing is a form of continuing medical education where a trained health professional visits prescribers for a fifteen to twenty minute session to provide objective information regarding a therapeutic topic based on best available evidence [ 86, 87].	[]
Following academic detailing, physician and NP rankings of pharmaceutical industry representatives were second or third for frequency of use, usefulness, accessibility, credibility, and current / timeliness.	[]
Limitations	[]
We do not have demographics or information regarding the reasons why survey recipients did not respond.	[]
As per ethical requirements to maintain confidentiality of respondents, we were not able to match respondents from their respective place of practice and therefore cannot conclude whether the practitioners within a practice setting influenced the others ' responses.	[]
The sample size of the survey is small although it includes 88% response from community based NPs in Nova Scotia.	[]
The generalizability of the results is limited due to the variations in NP scopes of practice nationally and internationally.	[]
It is unknown whether the findings are generalizable to nonresponding physicians within Nova Scotia collaborating with NPs or to physicians not in collaborative practices with NPs as they were not included as a part of the sample.	[]
Due to multiple statistical comparisons ( Mann Whitney U), the results comparing NP and physician ratings of results should be interpreted with caution.	[]
Conclusion	[]
Respondent ratings of resources and preferences for resource use were consistent with self - reported means of conducting searches for specific drug information queries.	[]
The use of computers and PDAs remains limited and also matches preferences and resource ratings.	[]
Education to this group of practitioners regarding available drug information resources may facilitate use of computer and PDA resources.	[]
Further research is needed to determine methods to increase the use of computers and PDAs and if use of these technologies affects prescribing and patient outcomes.

Expression of C - terminal deleted p53 isoforms in neuroblastoma	[]
Abstract	[]
The tumor suppressor gene, p53, is rarely mutated in neuroblastomas ( NB) at the time of diagnosis, but its dysfunction could result from a nonfunctional conformation or cytoplasmic sequestration of the wild - type p53 protein.	[]
However, p53 mutation, when it occurs, is found in NB tumors with drug resistance acquired over the course of chemotherapy.	[]
As yet, no study has been devoted to the function of the specific p53 mutants identified in NB cells.	[]
This study includes characterization and functional analysis of p53 expressed in eight cell lines: three wild - type cell lines and five cell lines harboring mutations.	[]
We identified two transcription - inactive p53 variants truncated in the C - terminus, one of which corresponded to the p53 beta isoform recently identified in normal tissue by Bourdon et al.	[]
[ J. C. Bourdon, K. Fernandes, F. Murray - Zmijewski, G. Liu, A. Diot, D. P. Xirodimas, M. K. Saville and D. P. Lane ( 2005) Genes Dev., 19, 2122 - 2137].	[]
Our results show, for the first time, that the p53 beta isoform is the only p53 species to be endogenously expressed in the human NB cell line SK - N - AS, suggesting that the C - terminus truncated p53 isoforms may play an important role in NB tumor development.	"human	124	129	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
INTRODUCTION	[]
The p53 tumor suppressor gene remains the most frequently altered gene in human tumors.	"human	74	79	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Several p53 mutation databases have been reported previously ( 1 - 3), and to date, more than 1500 different p53 mutants have been described ( 4).	[]
Functional inactivation of p53 is usually due to gene mutation, deletion or protein degradation.	[]
In general, the majority of p53 mutations in human neoplasia are missense mutations affecting the DNA - binding domain ( DBD).	"human	45	50	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Unlike other human cancers, p53 in neuroblastoma ( NB) is rarely mutated in the primary tumor at diagnosis but high levels of wild - type p53 ( wt p53) protein expression have been found in the cytoplasm of undifferentiated tumors ( 5, 6).	"human	13	18	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
More recently, in normal unstressed cells, wt p53 protein was found to be retained in the cytoplasm as a latent form, in huge, p53 - associated protein complexes known as ' Parc ' ( 7).	[]
The steady - state concentration of p53 in normal unstressed cells is usually very low because of the short half - life of the wild - type ( wt) protein.	[]
Overexpression of p53 in most of the transformed cells containing a missense mutation within the p53 gene appears to be due to the increased stability of mutated p53 ( 8).	[]
In unstressed NB cells, high wt p53 expression may reflect the embryonic origin of NBs, in which precursor cells fail to mature ( 9).	[]
p53 mutations are unusual in human NB but, when they do occur, are found in post - chemotherapy tumors.	"human	29	34	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In this respect, Tweddle et al.	[]
( 10) described how two NB cell lines derived from the same patient can elicit a different p53 status: wt p53 for SK - N - BE ( 1a) established before treatment, and mutated p53 for SK - N - BE ( 2c) established after relapse of the patient under treatment with cytotoxic agents such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and radiotherapy.	"patient	60	67	Organism/Species"	"patient	60	67	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In NB cell lines, p53 mutation has been found in multidrug - resistant cells ( 11).	[]
Various types of p53 mutation have been detected in NB cells and can lead to inactivation either by shut - down of protein expression or production of aberrant p53 products.	[]
Indeed, in LAN - 1 cells, p53 nonsense mutation at cysteine 182 in exon 5 leads to the absence of protein ( 9), whereas in SK - N - BE ( 2) cells, missense mutation at codon 135 ( C135F) leads to stable overexpressed protein ( 11).	[]
By analyzing IGR - N - 91, a cell line established in our laboratory from the bone marrow of a patient with metastatic NB after unsuccessful Adriamycin - vincristine chemotherapy ( 12), we identified another type of aberrant protein that arises from the duplication of exons 7 - 8 - 9.	"patient	95	102	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This duplication spans from amino acids 225 to 331, which represent part of the DBD and part of the oligomerization domain ( 13).	[]
However, each p53 mutant has been described in the literature as a case report, and so far, no comparative study has been undertaken to link their biochemical features with functional properties.	[]
In the present study we report two novel p53 C - terminus mutants identified in SK - N - AS and IGR - NB8 human NB cell lines.	"human	106	111	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The biological properties of these two new variants were analyzed in comparison with p53 isolated from six other human NB lines: three [ LAN - 1, SK - N - BE ( 2) and IGR - N - 91] expressing mutant p53 and three ( SH - SY5Y, LAN - 5 and IMR - 32) expressing the wt protein.	"human	113	118	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This characterization was done by using a range of functional assays: ( i) the ability of the protein to bind with p53 consensus sequence using the functional analysis of separated allele in yeast ( FASAY); ( ii) the ability of the protein to transactivate the p53 - responsive element ( RE) identified either in the promoter of p21 / WAF1 or in the first intron of BAX, using luciferase reporter assay; ( iii) the induction of endogenous p21 / WAF1 gene expression under stress conditions.

In a selective medium lacking leucine, wt - p53 activates transcription of ADE2 gene that encodes enzyme - - phosphoribosylimidaz carboxylase - - implicated in adenine biosynthesis.	[]
Therefore, a colony of cells that expresses ADE2 gene is white whereas the one composed of cells where ADE2 gene is not expressed owing p53 mutation is red.	[]
RESULTS	[]
P53 status in SK - N - AS and IGR - NB8 cells	[]
We first compared the migration profiles of p53 expressed in SK - N - AS and IGR - NB8 with those expressed in the other six NB cells, SH - SY5Y, LAN - 5, LAN - 1, IMR - 32, SK - N - BE ( 2) and IGR - N - 91.	[]
Western blots from 50 mu g of total protein extracts were revealed with p53 monoclonal antibody ( DO - 7).	[]
A range of profiles was identified as shown in Figure 1A.	[]
As expected, p53 extracted from the three cell lines, SH - SY5Y, LAN - 5 and IMR - 32, expressing wt protein ( 13, 21) migrated at the wt position.	[]
Of particular note in these three wt p53 cell lines was an additional faint band that migrated faster than the full - length protein.	[]
The LAN - 1 cells were found to be p53 deficient ( 9).	[]
The SK - N - BE ( 2) cell line showed an intense band reflecting p53 stability due to a missense mutation at codon 135 ( 11).	[]
As expected, due to the previously identified duplication of exons 7 - 8 - 9 ( 13), p53 protein migration was delayed in the IGR - N - 91 cells.	[]
In contrast, the p53 protein in the SK - N - AS cell line migrated noticeably faster than the wt protein, indicating that it was smaller in size.	[]
The p53 protein in the IGR - NB8 cell line was even smaller than that in SK - N - AS.	[]
To analyze the coding region of each of the p53 variants, RT - PCR was performed using p53 - specific F1 - R7 primers ( Table 1 and Figure 1B).	[]
The expected 1430 bp for full - length p53 was amplified from wt p53 - expressing SH - SY5Y, LAN - 5 and IMR - 32 cell lines.	[]
As SK - N - BE ( 2) harbors a single point mutation at codon 135 ( C135F), the amplified fragment analyzed by electrophoresis migrated as wt p53 ( Figure 1B).	[]
The longer RT - PCR fragment from the mutated IGR - N - 91 cell line resulted from the duplication of exons 7 - 8 - 9, as shown in our previous data ( 13), which corresponds to extra nucleic material of 321 nt.	[]
For the LAN - 1 cells, no amplified fragment was observed in accordance with published data, which demonstrates the extremely low levels of p53 mRNA and the undetectable level of protein ( 9).	[]
An amplified fragment of the same length as the wt protein was observed in the IGR - NB8 cell line ( Figure 1B).	[]
Indeed, complete gene sequencing revealed a point mutation E326STOP leading to a truncated protein at C - terminus.	[]
No fragment, however, was amplified from SK - N - AS with F1 - R7 primers.	[]
To further map the p53 mRNA transcribed in these cells, series of RT - PCR tests were performed using the forward primer, F2 ( exon 8 position 1008th according to GenBank accession no. K03199), matched with different reverse primers, R3 ( at the junction of exon 8 / 9, nt position 1124), R4, R5 ( in exon 9 at positions 1154 and 1184, respectively), and R6 ( in exon 10, at position 1230).	[]
The sequences of these primers are given in Table 1 and the results are presented in Figure 2A.	[]
SK - N - AS cDNA gave an amplified fragment of the same size as SH - SY5Y cDNA with the three primer pairs, F2 / R3, F2 / R4 and F3 / R5.	[]
However, in contrast to SH - SY5Y, no fragment was obtained with SK - N - AS cDNA using the F2 / R6 primer pair, which suggests the absence of exon 10 in SK - N - AS mRNA.	[]
The p53 protein expressed in SK - N - AS is the p53 beta isoform	[]
An alternatively spliced form of human p53 mRNA with an additional 133 bp exon derived from intron 9 has been detected in normal human lymphocytes ( 15).	"human	33	38	Organism/Species"	"human	33	38	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This spliced variant named ' i9 + ' encodes a truncated protein of 341 amino acids including 10 new amino acids derived from the novel exon, the p53 beta isoform according to Bourdon et al. nomenclature ( 22).	[]
This led us to hypothesize that the shorter protein expressed by the SK - N - AS cell line could be the p53 beta isoform.	[]
To test this hypothesis, RT - PCRs were performed using primer sets designed to amplify the 3 ' region of p53 mRNA encoding either the specific C - terminal part of the wt protein ( wt C - ter) or the specific C - terminal part of the beta isoform ( beta C - ter).	[]
In parallel amplification with a primer pair amplifying the DBD was used as control.	[]
The sequences of these oligonucleotides are given in Table 1.	[]
The results presented in Figure 2B are consistent with the only expression of the p53 beta isoform in SK - N - AS as no band was observed in lane using specific C - ter primer located in exon 10.	[]
Interestingly, RT - PCR using SH - SY5Y ( SH) gave an amplified fragment not only with the primer pair specific to the C - ter domain of wt p53 but also with the primer pair specific to the p53 beta isoform.	[]
This result, combined with the presence of an additional faint band migrating faster than wt p53 in denaturing polyacrylamide gel ( Figure 1A), strongly suggests that both the p53 full - length protein and the beta isoform were expressed in the SH - SY5Y cells.	[]
The full - length SK - N - AS p53 cDNA was then amplified with the forward primer F1 and a reverse primer located within the novel exon i9 + ( Table 1).	[]
This amplified fragment was cloned in pcDNA3 / V5 - His - Topo, as described in Materials and Methods.	[]
Its sequence analysis confirmed that the truncated p53 expressed in SK - N - AS was encoded by the i9 + splice variant described previously by Flaman et al.	[]
( 15) that encodes the p53 beta isoform characterized by Bourdon et al.	[]
( 22).	[]
A series of genomic amplifications were performed to identify a possible deletion within the intron 9 that could account for the absence of normal size p53 in SK - N - AS cells.	[]
The primer sequences are given in Table 1.	[]
Amplifications were performed in parallel with total DNA extracted from SH - SY5Y and SK - N - AS cells.	[]
Results are presented in Figure 3.	[]
Normal size fragments that encompass the acceptor site of intron 9 were amplified with SH - SY5Y as well as with SK - N - AS DNA.	[]
On the contrary amplification fragments that encompass the intron 9 donor site were obtained only with SH - SY5Y but not with SK - N - AS DNA.	[]
These results identify a deletion of the intron 9 / exon 10 junction within the SK - N - AS p53 gene.	[]
A yeast functional assay confirmed the absence of p53 full - length expression in SK - N - AS and IGR - NB8	"yeast	2	7	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""yeast"", ""start_span"": 2, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
It is possible to detect p53 mutation using a simple yeast colony color assay as described by Flaman et al.	"yeast	53	58	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""yeast"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
( 23).	[]
When the strain is transformed with a plasmid - encoding wt p53, the cells express the ADE2 gene and produce white colonies ( Figure 4A, a, b2 and c1, and Figure 4B, dish a).	[]
Cells containing mutant p53 fail to express ADE2 and form small red colonies ( Figure 4A, b and b1, and Figure 4B, dish c).	[]
When the p53 cDNA fragment is deleted, cells are unable to form a colony ( Figure 4A, c and c2).	[]
As shown in Table 2, FASAY was performed as a p53 - standard test with full - length cDNA or with the split version at the 5 ' and 3 ' end ( 15).	[]
The background of FASAY experiments is around 10%.	[]
p53 wt expressing SH - SY5Y and LAN - 5, 2 wt cell lines, yielded ~ 92 - 97% of white colonies ( Table 2).	[]
One hundred percent of the colonies carrying SK - N - BE ( 2) p53, which is homozygous for the C135F mutation, turned red with the standard or 5 ' split assay, whereas 94% of the colonies turned white with the 3 ' split assay since the missense mutation does not extend to the C ' - terminus of the gene ( Table 2 and Figure 4B, dish c).	[]
No colonies were observed with p53 - deficient LAN - 1 cells, ( see also Figure 4A, c and c2).	[]
With SK - N - AS cells, the split 5 ' assay gave 96% white colonies, while the p53 - standard and split 3 ' assay did not produce any colonies ( Table 2).	[]
This means that the 5 ' terminus was intact whereas the 3 ' terminus had been deleted, as was confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis.	[]
The IGR - NB8 colonies, however, were red both with the p53 - standard assay and the split 3 ' assay.	[]
In the IGR - N - 91 cell line, where p53 harbors two contiguous sets of exons 7 - 9, spanning the DBD and oligomerization domain, it is interesting to note that the yeast colonies were predominantly white ( Figure 4B, dish b) with the split 5 ' and the split 3 ' assay ( 96 and 87% of white colonies, respectively) This suggests that the cells express a binding ability that is specific to wild - type p53 rather than mutated p53 ( Table 2).

Transcription activity of SH - SY5Y, IGR - N - 91, SK - N - BE ( 2), SK - N - AS and IGR - NB8 p53 variants in mammalian cells	[]
To determine the transactivation ability of p53 variants in mammalian cells, we used a reporter gene strategy.	[]
The p53RE located within either the human p21 / WAF1 promoter or the intron 1 of the mouse and human BAX gene [ ( 18) and D.

Munsch, personnal communication) were cloned in a luciferase reporter gene plasmid upstream of the E1B minimal promoter as described in Materials and Methods.	[]
The p53 - negative LAN - 1 cells were cotransfected with the p53 vectors expressing the p53 cloned from either SH - SY5Y, IGR - N - 91, SK - N - BE ( 2), SK - N - AS or IGR - NB8 and the luciferase reporter plasmids.	[]
Both p53RE were strongly stimulated in cells cotransfected with wt p53 cloned from SH - SY5Y, as compared to cells cotransfected with an empty plasmid.	[]
In contrast, none of the p53 variants was able to transactivate the expression of luciferase driven by either p21 / WAF1 or BAX p53RE ( Figure 5).	[]
To test transactivation capability at the protein level, each variant was transfected into p53 - negative LAN - 1 cells and the stimulation of endogenous p21 / Waf1 gene expression was analyzed by western blotting.	[]
As shown in Figure 6, in contrast to wt p53, none of the p53 variants was able to induce p21 protein accumulation.	[]
We then tested for a possible dominant negative effect of these various mutants on wt p53 - dependent transcriptional activity.	[]
To this end, SH - SY5Y cells were cotransfected with constructs encoding the luciferase gene driven by either the p21 / Waf1 or BAX p53RE and the constructs expressing the various p53s cloned from IGR - NB8, SK - N - BE ( 2), IGR - N - 91, SK - N - AS and IGR - NB8 NB cells or p53DD, a dominant negative mutant of wt p53 ( 24).	[]
The stress induced by transfection activated the transcriptional activity of the wt p53 expressed in SH - SY5Y, leading to a p53 - dependent expression of luciferase as illustrated by the fact that coexpression of p53DD led to a substantial decrease in luciferase activity when compared to the luciferase activity of cells cotransfected with an empty plasmid ( Figure 5).	[]
Compared to p53DD, mutants within the DBD isolated from IGR - N - 91 or SK - N - BE ( 2) had only a moderate dominant negative effect on endogenous wt p53 transcriptional activity.	[]
More surprisingly, the transfection of the C - terminal truncated variant IGR - NB8 enhanced both BAX and p21 / WAF1 p53RE activity.	[]
The coexpression of p53 beta cloned from SK - N - AS also enhanced BAX p53RE activity.	[]
A similar effect has been reported already for p53 beta by Bourdon et al.	[]
( 22).	[]
When combined, these results show that all the p53 variants isolated from the NB cells had lost the ability to specifically transactivate the p53 target genes.	[]
Their effect on the transcriptional activity of endogenous wt p53 expressed in SH - SY5Y cells, however, largely depended on the p53 domain affected by the modification.	[]
All the identified p53 variants inhibited the induction of endogenous p21 / WAF1 gene expression under stress conditions	[]
We further examined whether the four p53 variants, SK - N - BE ( 2), IGR - N - 91, SK - N - AS and IGR - NB8, had loss their ability to stimulate the endogenous expression of the p21 / WAF1 gene, the archetypical cell cycle inhibitor and the true target of p53.	[]
To this end, cellular response to genotoxic stress was analyzed by western blot following treatment of the various cell lines with cisplatin, one of the most potent antitumor agents used in neuroblastoma.	[]
Results are presented in Figure 7.	[]
None of the mutant cells, regardless of the type of mutation, was able to induce p21 / WAF1 protein accumulation, unlike the 3 p53 wild - type cells ( SH - SY5Y, IMR - 32 and LAN - 5).	[]
Genomic status of TP53 region in the various cell lines	[]
According to Knudson ' s ' two hit ' model of tumor suppressor gene functional inactivation, the mutation of one allele is supposed to be associated with a deletion of the second allele.	[]
To assess this genetic mechanism, we performed FISH experiments to search for deletions of one copy of the TP53 region, especially in cell lines with a mutated TP53 gene.	[]
For this purpose, metaphase preparations of the studied cell lines were cohybridized with a p53 DNA probe labeled in red ( BAC clone RP11 - 199F11) as described previously ( 25) and a chromosome 17 - specific centromeric probe labeled in green.	[]
The three cell lines shown previously to express a wt p53 protein ( LAN5, IMR32 and SH - SY5Y), displayed as expected two signals with each probe, confirming the presence of both TP53 alleles in these cells ( Figure 8 and Table 3).	[]
Conversely, IGR - N - 91 and SK - N - AS cell lines displayed only one fluorescent signal for each probe, suggesting a whole chromosome 17 lost, or at least losses of the 17p arm and the centromeric region.	[]
The SK - N - BE ( 2) cell line has been described as containing only one chromosome 17 and one TP53 signal ( 10).	[]
In our analysis, only 10% of the cells displayed this characteristic, whilst most of the cells had two copies of both ( Figure 8 and Table 3).	[]
p53 sequencing, however, confirmed the previously described mutation, and the absence of a normal allele, suggesting that the cells used in our study had acquired, during culture, an uniparental disomy for the TP53 - mutated chromosome 17.	[]
Finally, the other two cell lines ( LAN - 1 and IGR - NB8) displayed highly variable genetic heterogeneity from one cell to the next ( Table 3).	[]
Surprisingly, although p53 transcripts are extremely faintly expressed in LAN - 1 cell line, all cells showed several FISH signals with the 167 kb BAC probe used here.	[]
To understand this apparent contradiction, an array - CGH experiment was performed on an oligo - array Agilent, which indicated a 133 kb interstitial deletion corresponding to the p53 coding region and the 97 kb upstream region.	[]
Accordingly, the fluorescent spots observed in FISH experiments on LAN - 1 cells should be related to the hybridization of the 57 kb region downstream of p53 gene present in the BAC probe.	[]
IGRN - B8 cell line displayed a number of signals of both colors ranging from 0 to 4, with 87% of cells displaying a loss for one TP53 allele.	[]
Despite this genomic variability, analysis of the p53 protein showed a single shortened form in IGR - N - B8 cell line ( Figure 1).	[]
Consequently, and as suggested for SK - N - BE ( 2) cell line, IGR - N - B8 cell line should contain a variable number of copies of chromosome 17 with mutated p53.	[]
DISCUSSION	[]
The p53 gene, the ' genome guardian ', is mutated in over 50% of human cancers, with the most common mutations being missense mutations ( > 2 / 3 of mutations) ( 26).	"human	65	70	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In human neuroblastoma tumors, p53 mutations are rarely present at the time of diagnosis ( 5, 27); however, oncogenic p53 mutations can be found in advanced neuroblastomas that often relapse following high - dose chemotherapy ( 10).	"human	3	8	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In contrast, in breast cancers, it has been reported that p53 mutations might improve response to high - dose chemotherapy including therapy with epirubicin and cyclophosphamide ( 28).	[]
An investigation into the p53 genomic status and functions of eight human NB lines revealed that all five of the mutated cell lines had distinct genetic characteristics as is schematically represented in Figure 9: SK - N - BE ( 2) with a single missense mutation in the p53 gene, encoding a highly stable full - length protein.	"human	68	73	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
SK - N - AS and IGR - NB8 proteins, although they have intact transactivation and DBDs, were truncated at the C - terminus generating 341 and 326 amino acids respectively; they therefore lack the tetramerization domain that is essential for an active conformation.	[]

( 22) reported the putative occurrence of beta and gamma isoforms from different tissues due to alternate splicing that indicates the similarity to those of p73 and p63 as identified previously by Daniel Caput and co - workers ( 29).	[]
In the p53 isoforms scheme proposed by Bourdon et al.	[]
( 22), the SK - N - AS cell line that elicits p53i9 protein expression is consistent with the p53 beta isoform.	[]
Genomic analysis reveals that the only occurrence of the p53 beta isoform in SK - N - AS results from a deletion spanning the intron 9 / exon 10 junction.	[]
Similar to the p53 beta isoform in SK - N - AS, the p53 in IGR - NB8 that lacks 67 amino acids at C - terminus was, alone, unable to induce p21 / WAF1 promoter activation except with endogenous wt - p53 on SH - SY5Y cells where transfection with IGR - NB8 significantly augmented the transcriptional activation of the p21 / Waf - 1 promoter ( Figure 5A).	[]
Studies by other authors have reported the interaction between the C - terminal domain and another region that impedes the active conformation of p53, suggesting an allosteric model for p53 activity regulation ( 30).	[]
Such events have been demonstrated for the 342 - stop mutant, generated by mutagenesis, which can modulate transactivation, growth and apoptosis ( 31).	[]
Moreover, Harms and Chen ( 32) reported that the C - terminal basic domain inhibits induction of the proapoptotic target gene insulin - like growth factor binding protein 3, suggesting that IGR - NB8 might induce this gene.	[]
IGR - N - 91 had an abnormally high molecular weight protein due to the duplication of wild - type exons 7 - 8 - 9, thus affecting the DBD and OD; and LAN - 1, with a mutation at codon 182 ( Cys - - > stop) concurred with an earlier report showing extremely low levels of mRNA and undetectable protein expression ( 9).	[]
Notably, all the p53 variants, including SK - N - AS ( beta isoform) and IGR - NB8 ( C - terminal truncated p53), elicited a total lack of p21 promoter activation.	[]
In particular, the p53 beta isoform was unable to induce endogenous p21 expression in SK - N - AS ( Figure 6), concurring with data obtained from in vitro transfection experiments in H1299 cells by Bourdon et al.	[]
( 22).	[]
For the IGR - N - 91 cells, although p53 was mutated and unable to transactivate the p21 / WAF1 promoter, the FASAY global test was not conclusive since ~ 80% of colonies were white and nearly 20% ( see also Table 2), though not enough, were red.	[]
Moreover, in this particular line, standard sequencing on cDNA using primers located within each exon as used for routine tumor analysis was unable to detect any anomalies in p53 genetic status ( data not shown).	[]
These results enlighten the limit of the conventional tests to detect a transcription inactivation of p53 brought by duplication within the DBD.	[]
Analysis of p53 genomic status was explored by FISH experiments, in search for a potential biallelic inactivation of p53, with a mutation of one allele and a deletion of the second one.	[]
This situation was indeed clearly observed in IGR - N - 91 and SK - N - AS cell lines, with an unambiguous loss of one chromosome 17p arm in all cells of both.	[]
SK - N - BE ( 2), LAN - 1 and IGR - NB - 8 cell lines showed a more complex genomic situation which should be relevant of variable copy numbers of chromosome 17 bearing in most cases ( LAN - 1) or in all cases [ SKN - BE ( 2), IGR - NB8] the mutated characteristic p53 allele.	[]
Our data therefore clearly demonstrate that each technique has a role and a combination of techniques is required in order to correctly define the p53 phenotype and genotype in tumor and particularly in NB cells.	[]
Our data enlighten a high frequency of the C - terminal abnormalities ( 3 / 5 mutated) in NB cell lines.	[]
For SK - N - AS and IGR - NB8, a part of the oligomerization domain was lost and IGR - N - 91 gained an extra oligomerization domain.	[]
According to FASAY assay the p53 expressed in IGR - N - 91 still specifically bind DNA but not the p53 expressed in SK - N - AS and IGR - NB8 in agreement with previous published data obtained by electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( 33).	[]
With regards to biological relevance, different mutants within the DBD vary in their oncogenicity.	[]
They are classified into two types depending of the location of the mutation, mutations of class I occur in the DNA contact areas, while class II mutations occur in areas important for the conformational stability of p53 protein ( 30).	[]
Although both class I and class II mutants have loss its ability to specifically bind DNA, class II mutations have been shown to be more oncogenic than class I.	[]
However, to our knowledge the oncogenicity of mutant affecting the C - terminal domain have not been studied.	[]
The biological role of the C - terminal mutants needs now to be thoroughly investigated in NB tumors.	[]
MUC1 alters oncogenic events and transcription in human breast cancer cells	"human	50	55	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Abstract	[]
Introduction	[]
MUC1 is an oncoprotein whose overexpression correlates with aggressiveness of tumors and poor survival of cancer patients.	"patients	113	121	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Many of the oncogenic effects of MUC1 are believed to occur through interaction of its cytoplasmic tail with signaling molecules.	[]
As expected for a protein with oncogenic functions, MUC1 is linked to regulation of proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and transcription.	[]
Methods	[]
To clarify the role of MUC1 in cancer, we transfected two breast cancer cell lines ( MDA - MB - 468 and BT - 20) with small interfering ( si) RNA directed against MUC1 and analyzed transcriptional responses and oncogenic events ( proliferation, apoptosis and invasion).	[]
Results	[]
Transcription of several genes was altered after transfection of MUC1 siRNA, including decreased MAP2K1 ( MEK1), JUN, PDGFA, CDC25A, VEGF and ITGAV ( integrin alpha v), and increased TNF, RAF1, and MMP2.	[]
Additional changes were seen at the protein level, such as increased expression of c - Myc, heightened phosphorylation of AKT, and decreased activation of MEK1 / 2 and ERK1 / 2.	[]
These were correlated with cellular events, as MUC1 siRNA in the MDA - MB - 468 line decreased proliferation and invasion, and increased stress - induced apoptosis.	[]
Intriguingly, BT - 20 cells displayed similar levels of apoptosis regardless of siRNA, and actually increased proliferation after MUC1 siRNA.	[]
Conclusion	[]
These results further the growing knowledge of the role of MUC1 in transcription, and suggest that the regulation of MUC1 in breast cancer may be more complex than previously appreciated.	[]
The differences between these two cell lines emphasize the importance of understanding the context of cell - specific signaling events when analyzing the oncogenic functions of MUC1, and caution against generalizing the results of individual cell lines without adequate confirmation in intact biological systems.	[]
Introduction	[]
MUC1 is the founding member of the mucin family: proteins characterized by heavy O - glycosylation centering around a variable number of tandem repeats that are rich in serine and threonine residues [ 1, 2].	[]
MUC1 is a transmembrane heterodimer with one subunit solely extracellular ( MUC1 - EX), and the other subunit composed of a short extracellular stem, a single transmembrane domain, and the cytoplasmic tail ( together called the MUC1 - CT).	[]
MUC1 possesses both pro - and anti - adhesive capacities, as the MUC1 - EX provides binding sites for a variety of adhesion proteins, while its large size and extended structure prevents cell - cell contact [ 3 - 5].	[]
Initially described as a tumor antigen overexpressed in > 90% of breast cancers, MUC1 is now known to be an oncogene with roles in both tumor formation and progression [ 1, 6].	[]
Mouse studies have been integral to the current understanding of MUC1 in cancer.	"Mouse	0	5	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Mouse"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Muc1 knockout mice ( Muc1 - / -; MUC1 is human; Muc1 is mouse) show a reduction in tumorigenic phenotype when crossed onto mice overexpressing the Wnt - 1 [ 7] or polyomavirus middle T antigen [ 8] oncogenes in the mammary gland.	"mice	14	18	Organism/Species"	"human	41	46	Organism/Species"	"mouse	56	61	Organism/Species"	"mice	14	18	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In contrast, MUC1 overexpression in the mammary gland drives tumor formation [ 9], indicating that MUC1 is a true oncogene.	[]
Many of the oncogenic effects of MUC1 stem from its cytoplasmic tail, which binds to several proteins implicated in cancer, including c - Src [ 10, 11] and the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR) family [ 12, 13].	[]
MUC1 stimulates mitogen activated protein kinase ( MAPK) signaling through the extracellular signal regulated kinases ( ERK1 / 2) [ 12, 14]; this can occur through MUC1 association with Grb2 and son of sevenless to activate Ras [ 15].	[]
ERK1 / 2 signaling is commonly stimulated by the Ras - Raf - MEK ( MAPK and ERK kinase) cascade downstream of mitogens such as EGFR [ 16], and regulates transcription via factors like the activator protein - 1 complex.	[]
Loss of MUC1 can reduce EGFR expression [ 17], providing another means of affecting MAPK signaling.	[]
Our results describe a novel mechanism by which MUC1 regulates the ERK1 / 2 pathway, through modulating transcription of the genes encoding MEK1, Raf - 1, and c - Jun.	[]
MUC1 expression correlates with increased survival in response to cytotoxic or oxidative agents [ 18 - 21], and can activate the phosphoinositol - 3 kinase - AKT pathway as part of an anti - apoptotic response [ 18].	[]
MUC1 has also recently been linked to transcription, as the MUC1 - CT localizes to the nucleus [ 22] and affects transcription by beta - catenin [ 22, 23], FOXO3a [ 21], p53 [ 24], and estrogen receptor alpha [ 25].	[]
However, there are indications that the role of MUC1 in oncogenesis is regulated by cell type and signaling context.	[]
For example, MUC1 can stimulate Fas - mediated apoptosis [ 26], while Muc1 is specifically down - regulated in c - neu - induced mammary tumors [ 27].	[]
This report emphasizes the complexity of MUC1 signaling in breast cancer by contrasting results from two established breast cancer cell lines.	[]
To understand MUC1 function in cells with high endogenous expression, that is, cells likely to have evolved with active MUC1 signaling, we used small interfering RNA ( siRNA) to knock down MUC1 in MDA - MB - 468 and BT - 20 cells.	[]
We then analyzed transcription of 84 genes involved in cancer, as well as the effects upon cellular events linked to oncogenesis, such as apoptosis and proliferation.	[]
Though the cell lines show some similarity in transcriptional alterations after transfection with MUC1 siRNA, their phenotypes are quite dissimilar: MDA - MB - 468 increases apoptosis and reduces proliferation and invasion, while BT - 20 proliferates more rapidly after loss of MUC1.	[]
This last may reflect the striking amount of active AKT in BT - 20; AKT activity is increased in both cell lines after MUC1 siRNA, which agrees with a previous study of MUC1 siRNA [ 21], but disagrees with results from 3Y1 fibroblasts [ 18].	[]
Recent studies have emphasized the complex and context - specific regulation of even such classic oncogenes as AKT [ 28].	[]
The differences between the two breast cancer cell lines in this study suggest that MUC1 oncogenic functions are also subject to cell - specific regulation, and stress the need for understanding the cellular signaling context when interpreting results.	[]
Materials and methods	[]
Cell culture and siRNA transfection	[]
MDA - MB - 468 and BT - 20 cells ( American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in Dulbecco ' s modified Eagle ' s medium ( Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) plus 10% fetal calf serum, 1% Glutamax ( Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin / streptomycin.	"calf	173	177	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""calf"", ""start_span"": 173, ""end_span"": 177, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Stable cell lines ( 468. Neo and 468. MUC1 Delta 8) were selected with 0. 5 mg / ml G418.	[]
For epidermal growth factor ( EGF) stimulation, MDA - MB - 468 cells were serum - starved overnight and treated for 10 minutes at 37 degrees C with 100 ng / ml EGF.	[]
Transient siRNA transfection was performed with Lipofectamine2000 ( Invitrogen) and 100 nM siRNA oligonucleotides.	[]
The commercially available siRNA constructs ( all from Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO, USA) were scrambled ( siCONTROL non - targeting siRNA # 1), or directed against firefly luciferase ( siCONTROL non - targeting siRNA # 2) or MUC1 ( siGENOME smartpool).	[]
The independent oligonucleotides designed in our laboratory target sequences beginning at MUC1 codons 882 and 956, and have been described previously [ 29].	[]
The scrambled siRNA construct was used only in BT - 20 cells as it causes a non - specific knockdown of MUC1 in the MDA - MB - 468 line.	[]
Cloning of MUC1 WT vector and stable transfection	[]
Two silent mutations ( G891A and T894C) were introduced into the MUC1 cDNA ( called MUC1 Delta 8) to make it resistant to the 882 siRNA that targets that region of the mRNA.	[]
The mutant cDNA was cloned into the pLNCX. 1 vector with neomycin resistance ( gift of Joseph Loftus, Mayo Clinic, Arizona, USA).	[]
Stable transfection was performed with Lipofectamine2000; cells were selected beginning 24 hours post - transfection and maintained as a polyclonal population.	[]
Western blots and antibodies	[]
Cells were lysed in buffer ( 20 mM HEPES pH 8. 0, 150 mM sodium chloride, 1% Triton X - 100, 2 mM EDTA) with commercial protease ( Complete inhibitor cocktail, Roche, Pleasanton, CA, USA) and phosphatase inhibitors ( 10 mM sodium fluoride, 2 mM sodium vanadate, 50 mu M ammonium molybdate).	[]
Protein concentration was determined by BCA ( Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA); 50 mu g of lysate were loaded on SDS - PAGE gels for each experiment, except for the pMEK1 / 2 blot in MDA - MB - 468, where 150 mu g were used.	[]
Non - commercial antibodies used were: BC2, a mouse monoclonal to the MUC1 - EX ( gift of Dr McGuckin, Queensland University, Queensland, Australia), and CT2, an Armenian hamster monoclonal to the MUC1 - CT developed in our lab [ 12].	"mouse	46	51	Organism/Species"	"Armenian hamster	162	178	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Armenian hamster"", ""start_span"": 162, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Antibodies to pMEK1 / 2, MEK1 / 2, ERK1 / 2, Myc, pAKT, AKT, beta - tubulin ( all Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), beta - actin and dpERK1 / 2 ( both Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) were used according to manufacturers ' recommendations.	[]
All antibodies except beta - actin ( 1: 2, 500) and dpERK1 / 2 ( 1: 10, 000) were used at 1: 1, 000 dilution for western blots.	[]
Flow cytometric analysis of MUC1 was done with HMPV - FITC, which recognizes the core peptide of the MUC1 - EX tandem repeats ( Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA).	[]
Bromodeoxyuridine ( BrdU) staining was performed with a fluorescently conjugated antibody to BrdU ( BrdU - PE, BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) as described below.	[]
Densitometry was performed using the public domain ImageJ program ( developed at the NIH and available at [ 30].	[]
Each band was measured in three places; the results were averaged and normalized to tubulin to control for loading.	[]
Transwell invasion assays	[]
Cells were serum - starved beginning 24 hours post - siRNA transfection.	[]
Cells were re - plated in serum - free medium 48 hours post - transfection at 50, 000 cells per insert ( sized for 24 - well plates), with serum - containing medium in the bottom of the growth well as an attractant.	[]
Transwell inserts ( BD Biosciences) pre - coated with laminin, fibronectin, collagen IV, or control ( no matrix) were used, and cells were permitted to invade for 48 hours.	[]
At this point ( 96 hours post - transfection), visual inspection of the growth wells confirmed that negligible numbers of cells went through to the bottom of the plate.	[]
Non - invaded cells were swabbed from the tops of half of the inserts ( ' samples ', containing only invaded cells), and retained in the others ( ' controls ', all cells).	[]
Inserts were stained for 10 minutes with crystal violet ( 0. 5% in 20% methanol) and washed with water.	[]
Membranes were cut out and destained for 10 minutes in 10% acetic acid in a 96 - well plate; membranes were removed and absorbance was read at 570 nm.	[]
Percent invasion is defined as ( absorbance of samples / absorbance of controls) x 100.	[]
[ 3H] Thymidine incorporation assays	[]
Cells were re - plated in quadruplicate 24 hours post - siRNA transfection at 15, 000 cells / well ( 96 - well plate) with [ 3H] thymidine ( 1 mu Ci / well), then incubated in normal conditions for 24 hours.	[]
At this time ( 48 hours post - siRNA transfection) excess radioactivity was washed off and the cells were harvested and read on a TopCount plate reader.	[]
Statistical analysis was performed using JMP 5. 1. 2 software ( SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA); the student ' s t test was used to determine p values and significance was confirmed with Wilcoxon rank sum and Pearson chi squared analyses.	[]
BrdU incorporation	[]
BrdU ( 50 mu M) was given to cells 48 hours post - siRNA transfection and permitted to incorporate for 1. 5 hours.	[]
Cells were then washed with PBS, trypsinized, and washed again.	[]
BrdU staining was performed according to an adaptation of the manufacturer ' s protocol: cells were re - suspended in PBS, mixed 1: 1 with - 20 degrees C neat ethanol, and incubated 1 hour at - 20 degrees C to fix.	[]
Fixed cells were then washed gently and denatured in 2 M HCl for 20 minutes at room temperature.	[]
Following washing and 2 minute ' s incubation with 0. 1 M Tris to neutralize the acid, cells were re - suspended in FACS buffer ( 0. 5% fetal calf serum in PBS) and stained with Phycoerythrin ( PE) - conjugated anti - BrdU according to the manufacturer ' s protocol for flow cytometry analysis on a FACScan instrument.

Apoptosis and trypan blue staining	[]
Apoptosis was measured using a kit ( BD Biosciences) containing propidium iodide ( PI) and FITC - conjugated annexin V.	[]
Cells were stained according to the manufacturer ' s protocol and the level of apoptosis determined by flow cytometry.	[]
Quadrants are: early apoptosis ( annexin V + / PI -, lower right) late apoptosis ( annexin V + / PI +, upper right) and non - apoptotic cell death ( annexin V - / PI +, upper left).	[]
Treatments for the stress panel were: no treatment ( control); DMSO as a control for celecoxib; 20 mM celecoxib, brand name Celebrex ( TM) ( dissolved in DMSO) [ 31]; 0. 2 mM H2O2 [ 32]; or 1 mg / mL G418 ( Pfizer, New York, NY, USA).	[]
Real - time PCR arrays	[]
Transcriptional analysis using Cancer PathwayFinder RT2 profiler arrays ( SuperArray, Frederick, MD, USA) was performed according to the manufacturer ' s protocol.	[]
Briefly, total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy extraction kit ( Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA); 1 mu g of RNA was reverse transcribed with the cDNA synthesis kit ( SuperArray) and cDNA was subjected to real - time PCR using SYBR green to detect product.	[]
Arrays were performed independently at least twice for each cell line; all PCR products were checked on agarose gels.	[]
Values were obtained for the threshold cycle ( Ct) for each gene and normalized using the average of four housekeeping genes on the same array ( HPRT1, RPL13A, GAPD, ACTB).	[]
Ct values for housekeeping genes and a dilution series of ACTB were monitored for consistency between arrays.	[]
Change ( Delta Ct) between MUC1 siRNA and control siRNA was found by:	[]
Delta Ct = Ct ( MUC1 siRNA) - Ct ( control siRNA)	[]
and fold change by:	[]
Fold change = 2 ( - Delta Ct)	[]
Values are given as fold change; only genes showing two - fold or greater change were considered.	[]
Both luciferase and scrambled siRNA controls were used in BT - 20; only genes showing consistent alteration with both controls were included in the results reported here.	[]
The scrambled siRNA could be not used in MDA - MB - 468 as these cells decrease MUC1 expression in response to this construct.	[]
Results	[]
siRNA transfection decreases MUC1 expression in breast cancer cell lines	[]
Two human breast cancer cell lines, MDA - MB - 468 and BT - 20, were transiently transfected with a pool of four siRNA oligonucleotides directed against the MUC1 mRNA ( 468. siMUC1 and BT. siMUC1), or a control oligonucleotide directed against luciferase ( 468. siLuc and BT. siLuc).	"human	4	9	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Both cell lines express high levels of MUC1, making them promising targets for this analysis.	[]
Western blots ( Figure 1a) show successful knockdown of both the extracellular domain and cytoplasmic tail fragments of MUC1; luciferase siRNA does not substantially change the level of MUC1 compared to parental cells.	[]
468. siMUC1 show a substantial decrease in the amount of MUC1 - CT, while BT. siMUC1 show slightly less knockdown of MUC1 - CT.	[]
Both MDA - MB - 468 and BT - 20 display a less dramatic decrease of MUC1 extracellular domain compared to MUC1 - CT ( Figure 1a); this likely represents protein synthesized prior to transfection, and may reflect differences in the turnover rates of the two subunits.	[]
Analysis of the MUC1 extracellular domain by flow cytometry confirms that both cell lines substantially decrease MUC1 expression after siRNA ( Figure 1b).	[]
By flow cytometry, 468. siMUC1 averaged 75% knockdown of MUC1 compared to 468. siLuc; and BT. siMUC1 averaged 50% knockdown relative to BT. siLuc.	[]
These effects could be titrated with the concentration of siRNA, were seen as early as 24 hours post - transfection ( data not shown) and lasted to at least 96 h post - transfection ( Figure 1b).	[]
All experiments were conducted within 48 to 96 hours after siRNA transfection.	[]
Similar results were obtained using two independent oligonucleotides designed in our lab ( data not shown), designated ' 882 ' and ' 956 ' for the initial codon recognized by each.	[]
Transcriptional changes are seen after MUC1 siRNA	[]
Recent work indicates that MUC1 may affect transcription both directly via interaction with transcription factors and indirectly ( for example, through modulating signaling).	[]
To study the effects of MUC1 knockdown in breast cancer cell lines, real - time PCR arrays were used to analyze transcription of 84 genes implicated in cancer.	[]
Only genes with greater than two - fold change were considered.	[]
Three genes ( MAP2K1, VEGF, PDGFA) were altered two - fold or more after MUC1 siRNA in both MDA - MB - 468 and BT - 20 cells ( Figure 2); two genes ( ITGAV, MMP2) changed only in 468. siMUC1; and five genes ( TIMP3, RAF1, JUN, TNF, CDC25A) only in BT. siMUC1.	[]
This list represents all genes affected greater than two - fold after MUC1 siRNA, rather than a select group.	[]
Three genes whose transcription was changed by less than two - fold are shown, two of which ( PDGFB and ITGB1) are listed because they relate closely to genes altered by two - fold ( PDGFA and ITGAV).	[]
The third, MYC, is included because western blots confirmed a substantial change at the protein level ( Figure 3a) that may reflect both transcriptional and post - transcriptional regulation.	[]
Interestingly, transcription of MAP2K1 was decreased in both cell lines after MUC1 siRNA.	[]
This gene encodes MEK1, one of the primary regulators of the ERK1 / 2 MAPK pathway [ 33], a network that has been linked several times to MUC1 [ 12, 34 - 36].	[]
We examined MEK1 and MEK2 levels by western blot to confirm decreased protein in MUC1 siRNA - treated cells ( Figure 3a), and found that not only were total MEK1 / 2 levels lower in 468. siMUC1 and BT. siMUC1 compared to controls ( 0. 48 and 0. 68 relative to siLuc, respectively), but so were the basal amounts of active ( phosphorylated) MEK1 / 2 ( pMEK1 / 2; 0. 12 and 0. 42 relative to siLuc, respectively).	[]
Both 468. siMUC1 and BT. siMUC1 also showed reduced activation of ERK1 / 2 ( dpERK1 / 2; 0. 21 and 0. 27 relative to siLuc, respectively), as would be expected with diminished signaling through MEK1 / 2; total ERK1 / 2 levels remain unchanged.	[]
As both lines have high levels of EGFR and thus activate the MEK - ERK cascade intensely when stimulated with EGF [ 37], siRNA - transfected cells were treated with EGF.	[]
Notably, MUC1 siRNA impairs this important oncogenic pathway in MDA - MB - 468 cells, as 468. siMUC1 display less pMEK1 / 2 in response to EGF than do 468. siLuc ( Figure 3b).	[]
Interestingly, EGF treatment of BT - 20 cells results in slightly higher pMEK1 / 2 levels in BT. siMUC1 compared to BT. siLuc.	[]
Though this result seems paradoxical in light of decreased MAP2K1 transcription in BT. siMUC1, it likely results from differential functions of Raf isoforms in combination with the increased RAF1 transcription ( Figure 2) and protein level ( Figure 3a) in these cells.	[]
Specifically, B - Raf is thought to be the main activator of MEK under normal conditions; Raf - 1 activates MEK in response to stimulus [ 38].	[]
Thus, it appears that basal pMEK1 / 2 levels are not greatly affected by Raf - 1 overexpression in BT. siMUC1 cells, likely because MEK is regulated primarily by B - Raf under normal growth conditions.	[]
In contrast, when the cells are stimulated ( EGF), increased Raf - 1 levels in BT. siMUC1 leads to heightened pMEK1 / 2 ( Figure 3b).	[]
MUC1 siRNA increases apoptosis in MDA - MB - 468 but not BT - 20	[]
We next examined whether MUC1 knockdown and its associated transcriptional alterations would affect overall cellular events.	[]
As several of the genes shown in Figure 2 are important in regulating proliferation and survival, and because of the recently described role of MUC1 in modulating apoptosis in response to cellular stresses [ 20, 21, 24], we first analyzed whether MUC1 siRNA would alter apoptosis in these lines.	[]
Although there was no change in basal apoptosis in either line ( Figure 4a), we observed that the cell lines responded differently when trypsinized for re - plating 24 hours after transfection ( Figure 4b).	[]
Interestingly, 468. siMUC1 cells show greater apoptosis after trypsinization than do 468. siLuc ( 49. 8% versus 34. 0%, respectively), while BT - 20 cells from both siRNA treatments display similar levels of apoptosis ( around 22%).	[]
To examine whether this phenomenon is specific to trypsin treatment or part of a general stress response involving MUC1, we subjected cells to a panel of stresses and measured cell death.	[]
In agreement with the patterns seen with trypsinization, BT. siLuc and BT. siMUC1 respond similarly to all treatments ( data not shown), while 468. siMUC1 die more readily than 468. siLuc in response to trypsin, G418, hydrogen peroxide, or celecoxib, a chemotherapeutic that targets the cyclooxygenase - 2 ( COX - 2) pathway ( Figure 4c); these data were confirmed with two independent siRNA constructs ( data not shown).	[]
Like the MAPK pathway, AKT signaling has been linked to MUC1 in cancer.	[]
Although transcription of AKT was not altered in MUC1 siRNA - treated cells, the results of our apoptosis studies prompted us to investigate levels of AKT further.	[]
As expected, the total AKT protein level is not greatly changed after MUC1 siRNA in either cell line, though the active form ( pAKT) is increased in both 468. siMUC1 and BT. siMUC1 compared to controls ( Figure 3a).	[]
This result disagrees with MUC1 activation of the AKT pathway in rat 3Y1 cells [ 18], and may reflect regulation more appropriate to breast cancer cells; this is supported by activation of AKT in response to MUC1 siRNA in other lines [ 21].	"rat	65	68	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""rat"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In addition, there is a striking difference in the relative amounts of AKT and pAKT in the two cell lines ( Figure 4d).	[]
When lysates from both lines are exposed to film for the same length of time ( overexposure masks the differences between BT. siLuc and BT. siMUC1 that are apparent in Figure 3a), it is clear that pAKT levels are much higher in BT - 20 than in MDA - MB - 468, despite lower total AKT expression.	[]
This difference in AKT activation between MDA - MB - 468 and BT - 20 likely contributes to the disparity in their sensitivity to the increased apoptosis expected with loss of MUC1.	[]
MUC1 siRNA alters proliferation and invasion	[]
As MUC1 is involved in apoptosis, we next analyzed its effects on proliferation.	[]
BrdU and [ 3H] thymidine incorporation were used to analyze proliferation after MUC1 siRNA.	[]
468. siMUC1 cells show a significant decrease in [ 3H] thymidine incorporation compared to 468. siLuc, while intriguingly, BT. siMUC1 cells show a significant increase in proliferation ( Figure 5a).	[]
Growth curves mirror these results, as do experiments with the two independent MUC1 siRNA oligonucleotides ( data not shown).	[]
Note that these assays require trypsinizing cells 24 hours post - transfection; therefore, the results in the MDA - MB - 468 line could stem from the changes in apoptosis described in the previous section, rather than a true effect on proliferation.	[]
To control for this, we incubated non - trypsinized, siRNA - transfected cells at similar confluence with BrdU to measure incorporation.	[]
The ' clumped ' profile of cells ( contrast to Figure 4b) is likely a result of the acid denaturation ( recommended by the antibody manufacturer), as it occurs uniformly in these experiments.	[]
BrdU incorporation ( Figure 5b) confirms that the [ 3H] thymidine results are not solely due to alterations in apoptosis, as 468. siMUC1 cells incorporate less BrdU than 468. siLuc; once again, BT. siMUC1 cells show increased proliferation over BT. siLuc.	[]
Given the role of MUC1 in adhesion, we examined whether MUC1 siRNA affects cellular invasion.	[]
In transwell assays, BT - 20 cells invaded poorly, regardless of the siRNA used ( data not shown).	[]
However, MDA - MB - 468 cells invade more readily, and were analyzed on a panel of three different extracellular matrix proteins.	[]
Interestingly, 468. siMUC1 cells display somewhat decreased invasion on collagen IV, laminin, and fibronectin matrices, and on a no - matrix control ( Figure 5c), which is in agreement with the trend towards decreased metastasis observed in Muc1 - / - x MMTV - PyV MT mice [ 8].	"MMTV	254	258	Organism/Species"	"mice	268	272	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""MMTV"", ""start_span"": 254, ""end_span"": 258, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 268, ""end_span"": 272, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Transfection of MUC1 rescues the 468. siMUC1 phenotype	[]
To determine if the above effects are specific to MUC1, we created stable transfectants of the MDA - MB - 468 line using empty vector ( 468. Neo) or a full - length MUC1 construct ( 468. MUC1 Delta 8) that is resistant to one of the independent MUC1 - directed oligonucleotides ( ' 882 ').	[]
These cells were maintained in G418 - containing medium to retain transgene selection.	[]
As expected, 468. MUC1 Delta 8 cells show higher levels of both the MUC1 extracellular domain and the MUC1 - CT than do 468. Neo ( Figure 6a).	[]
Note that 468. Neo have MUC1 expression comparable to parental MDA - MB - 468; the exposures in Figure 6a are lighter than those in Figure 1a, in order to clearly show the relative levels of MUC1 in the stable transfectants.	[]
After MUC1 siRNA, 468. MUC1 Delta 8 lose some MUC1 ( likely endogenous protein, which is not siRNA - resistant) but retain high - level expression, while 468. Neo show a decrease in MUC1 levels similar to parental 468. siMUC1 cells ( Figures 6a, b).	[]
The difference in the amount of MUC1 knockdown between 468. Neo and 468. MUC1 Delta 8 is highlighted by the purple shading in Figure 6b.	[]
BrdU incorporation ( Figure 6c) indicates that 468. Neo show decreased nucleotide incorporation after MUC1 siRNA compared to control ( 3. 3% versus 25. 0%, respectively); this is not seen in 468. MUC1 Delta 8 cells, which show similar levels of BrdU incorporation regardless of the siRNA used ( 21. 5% for luciferase, 23. 9% for MUC1).	[]
468. Neo cells display a more dramatic decrease in BrdU incorporation after MUC1 siRNA than what is seen in parental 468. siMUC1 cells, which may reflect the additional stress of being maintained in G418 - containing medium.	[]
Similarly, analysis of apoptosis in trypsinized cells indicates that the increased apoptosis seen in parental 468. siMUC1 cells is also present in the 468. Neo line after MUC1 siRNA ( Figure 6d; 43. 6% in control versus 59. 6% in MUC1 siRNA).	[]
However, in 468. MUC1 Delta 8 cells, the level of apoptosis after luciferase siRNA ( 34. 1%) is lower than that in 468. Neo cells; MUC1 siRNA increases the amount of apoptosis slightly ( 42. 8%), restoring it to a level similar to that seen in luciferase siRNA - treated 468. Neo cells.	[]
Together, these studies suggest that the above - described results are specific to MUC1, as stable transfection of an siRNA - resistant MUC1 rescues the phenotype seen in 468. siMUC1 cells.	[]
Discussion	[]
This report describes both the transcriptional alterations seen after transfection with MUC1 siRNA in human breast cancer cells and the effects on events such as apoptosis and proliferation.	"human	102	107	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The two cell lines used ( MDA - MB - 468 and BT - 20) were chosen for high expression of MUC1 and a substantial ( 50% to 75%), consistent decrease in MUC1 expression after siRNA.	[]
Both lines have epithelial morphology, form tumors slowly in nude mice [ 37], have mutant p53 [ 39, 40], express EGFR [ 37], and lack estrogen receptor alpha [ 41].	"nude mice	61	70	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""nude mice"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
One striking difference between these lines, however, is their response to MUC1 siRNA.	[]
MDA - MB - 468 cells behave as expected for loss of an oncogene: MUC1 siRNA correlates with increased apoptosis in response to stress, decreased proliferation, and reduced invasion.	[]
In contrast, BT. siMUC1 cells proliferate more rapidly than BT. siLuc cells with little effect on apoptosis.	[]
Much of the phenotype of these cells can be understood in light of protein levels and transcriptional activity after MUC1 siRNA.	[]
As mentioned, both MDA - MB - 468 and BT - 20 display increased pAKT after MUC1 siRNA, but the ratio of active to total AKT is considerably higher in the BT - 20 line, which may help these cells resist the increased apoptosis expected with loss of MUC1.	[]
Myc levels are also higher in both cell lines after MUC1 siRNA, although the ability of Myc to promote proliferation and apoptosis in different cellular contexts [ 42] complicates the interpretation of this finding.	[]
Both cell lines show reduced transcription of VEGF, PDGFA, PDGFB, and MAP2K1 ( MEK1) after MUC1 siRNA.	[]
The genes encoding vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) and the A and B chains of platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF - A and PDGF - B) are interesting as these proteins have been heavily implicated in angiogenesis, suggesting a novel function for MUC1 in regulating this process.	[]
Vascular endothelial growth factor expression in cancer is linked to tumor growth and metastasis [ 43, 44]; platelet - derived growth factor is also angiogenic, but has an additional role in stimulating desmoplasia [ 45].	[]
Reduced transcription of these genes after MUC1 siRNA suggests that MUC1 may foster angiogenesis and stromal proliferation, although this must be confirmed in a more appropriate model system.	[]
Decreased MAP2K1 ( MEK1) transcription after MUC1 siRNA provides a novel mechanism by which MUC1 can affect the ERK1 / 2 MAPK pathway.	[]
MUC1 has often been linked to the Ras - Raf - MEK - ERK cascade [ 12, 34 - 36, 46], and at least two mechanisms by which MUC1 can alter MAPK signaling have been described: MUC1 interaction with and phosphorylation by the EGFR family [ 12, 13], and MUC1 binding to the Grb2 / Sos complex that activates Ras [ 46].	[]
Reduction of MEK1 levels after MUC1 siRNA agrees with the role of MUC1 in strengthening MAPK signaling, and indicates that MUC1 can regulate both the transcription and activity of members of this pathway.	[]
Two additional MAPK pathway members are altered specifically in BT. siMUC1, with no corresponding change in 468. siMUC1 cells.	[]
These genes are RAF1 and JUN which are increased and decreased, respectively, after MUC1 siRNA.	[]
Raf - 1 and c - Jun both function outside of the ERK1 / 2 MAPK pathway, which may explain the seeming paradox of increased RAF1 transcription with simultaneous decreases in MAP2K1 and JUN.	[]
Specifically, Raf - 1 can inhibit ASK1 ( apoptosis signal - regulated kinase 1) upstream of p38 and JNK ( Jun N - terminal kinase) [ 38].	[]
ASK1 phosphorylates JNK in response to stress, resulting in activation of c - Jun and stimulation of apoptosis [ 47], indicating that the coordinate up - regulation of RAF1 and down - regulation of JUN may provide a potent anti - apoptotic effect in BT. siMUC1.	[]
Regulation of life and death is also a hallmark of the CDC25A and TNF gene products.	[]
CDC25A is a phosphatase that stimulates cell cycle progression [ 48], thus the effects of its decrease in BT. siMUC1 are unclear in light of the increased proliferation of these cells.	[]
However, the CDC25 proteins ( A, B, and C) were recently shown to have greater functional overlap than was previously thought [ 49], suggesting that the other two isoforms may compensate for reduced CDC25A levels.	[]
TNF encodes tumor necrosis factor ( TNF) alpha, known for its potent, cell type - specific control of life and death.	[]
In tumor cells, TNF alpha expression can promote proliferation and inhibit apoptosis [ 50], suggesting that increased TNF transcription in BT. siMUC1 could contribute to the increased proliferation seen in these cells.	[]
Interestingly, the increase in TNF is accompanied by decreased transcription of TIMP3, encoding tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases ( TIMP) 3.	[]
The TIMP family disrupts the function of matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs), generally resulting in decreased invasion [ 51].	[]
TIMP3 is unique in that it can also inhibit TNF alpha converting enzyme ( TACE), which activates TNF alpha by cleaving it from the cell surface [ 50].	[]
Reduced expression of TIMP3 would, therefore, foster signaling through TNF alpha by releasing inhibition of TNF alpha converting enzyme.	[]
In agreement with this, TIMP3 can promote apoptosis [ 52]; thus, its down - regulation in BT. siMUC1 provides another mechanism by which these cells are able to resist the increased apoptosis expected with loss of MUC1.	[]
Another TIMP target responds to MUC1 siRNA, as 468. siMUC1 cells show significantly increased expression of MMP2 ( encoding MMP - 2 / gelatinase A), the product of which degrades type IV collagen [ 52].	[]
In breast cancer, the ratio of active to latent MMP - 2 increases with tumor progression; MMP - 2 may facilitate both angiogenesis and metastasis [ 52].	[]
Its increase after loss of MUC1 is, therefore, unexpected, but at least two factors may clarify this result.	[]
First, though MMP - 2 levels are increased in mouse mammary tumors, its expression is confined to the stroma [ 53], suggesting that increased MMP2 transcription after loss of the epithelium - specific MUC1 might reflect a shift towards a more mesenchymal phenotype.	"mouse	46	51	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Second, MMP - 2 levels are increased by overexpression of erbB2 [ 52]; previous studies have shown that erbB2 and Muc1 expression are mutually exclusive in mammary tumors [ 27], implying that MMP2 might be part of a transcriptional profile linked to low MUC1 levels.	[]
It is intriguing that, despite increased MMP2 transcription, invasion is decreased in 468. siMUC1 cells, even on collagen IV.	[]
This may reflect insufficient activation of MMP - 2, as the precursor protein must be cleaved for enzymatic function [ 52].	[]
Alternatively, the slowed invasion of these cells may relate to impaired adhesion resulting from decreased transcription of ITGAV and ITGB1 ( alpha v and beta 1 integrins, respectively).	[]
Integrin signaling is tied to life - or - death decisions in epithelial cells, and integrin expression is vital for processes from wound healing to metastasis [ 54].	[]
Integrin alpha v beta 3 is implicated in facilitating metastasis of breast cancer cells to bone [ 55]; decreased transcription of ITGAV after MUC1 siRNA may, therefore, suggest that MUC1 is involved in this lethal process as well.	[]
The MUC1 oncogene has been linked to apoptosis [ 18, 20, 26], proliferation [ 17], and transcription [ 21, 23 - 25] in cancer.	[]
However, the two cell lines chosen for our study display very different responses to MUC1 siRNA, indicating that regulation of MUC1 in breast cancer is likely quite complex and cautioning against over - generalization of results from individual cell lines.	[]
Previous reports suggest that, though most studies outline a clearly oncogenic role for MUC1 in breast cancer, the exact details may vary depending on factors such as cell type and signaling context.	[]
For example, MUC1 stimulates Fas - mediated apoptosis in CHO cells [ 26], quite unlike the inhibition of apoptosis seen in other cell lines.	[]
Similarly, though MUC1 drives mammary oncogenesis in its own right [ 9] and facilitates tumorigenesis driven by other oncogenes [ 7, 8], Muc1 is selectively down - regulated in c - neu - induced mouse mammary tumors [ 27], indicating that the context of oncogenic signaling is vital to understanding the function of MUC1.	"mouse	195	200	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 195, ""end_span"": 200, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Thus, it is important to consider the relative levels of knockdown of MUC1 in the two cell lines: BT - 20 cells reduce MUC1 expression after siRNA less strongly than do MDA - MB - 468 ( 50% versus 75% knockdown, respectively).	[]
As MUC1 serves as a scaffold [ 11], overexpression of MUC1 relative to its associated signaling proteins might create a dilution effect, sequestering signal transducers away from each other; this would be relieved by MUC1 siRNA.	[]
Thus, enough MUC1 may be retained in BT. siMUC1 cells for its oncogenic effects, while signaling complex formation would be enhanced by lowering the amount of MUC1 relative to other signaling proteins.	[]
Conclusion	[]
The contrast between the MDA - MB - 468 and BT - 20 lines in response to MUC1 siRNA serves as a reminder that simplified models such as cell lines fail to encompass the complexity of intact biological systems.	[]
This report describes transcriptional alterations seen after MUC1 knockdown: decreased transcription of MAP2K1, VEGF, PDGFA, ITGAV, TIMP3, CDC25A, and JUN, and increased transcription of MMP2, TNF, and RAF1.	[]
The alterations in MAP2K1, RAF1, and JUN represent a novel means by which MUC1 can affect ERK1 / 2 signaling: transcriptional regulation of MAPK pathway members.	[]
Oncogenic events are also altered in both cell lines after MUC1 siRNA.	[]
These results strengthen the growing ties linking MUC1 and transcriptional regulation, and suggest that the role of MUC1 in breast cancer may be more complex than a direct correlation between MUC1 level and oncogenic function.	[]

The recombination - associated protein RdgC adopts a novel toroidal architecture for DNA binding	[]
Abstract	[]
RecA plays a central role in the nonmutagenic repair of stalled replication forks in bacteria.	[]
RdgC, a recombination - associated DNA - binding protein, is a potential negative regulator of RecA function.	[]
Here, we have determined the crystal structure of RdgC from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.	"Pseudomonas aeruginosa	60	82	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Pseudomonas aeruginosa"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The J - shaped monomer has a unique fold and can be divided into three structural domains: tip domain, center domain and base domain.	[]
Two such monomers dimerize to form a ring - shaped molecule of approximate 2 - fold symmetry.	[]
Of the two inter - subunit interfaces within the dimer, one interface ( ' interface A ') between tip / center domains is more nonpolar than the other ( ' interface B ') between base domains.	[]
The structure allows us to propose that the RdgC dimer binds dsDNA through the central hole of ~ 30 A diameter.	[]
The proposed model is supported by our DNA - binding assays coupled with mutagenesis, which indicate that the conserved positively charged residues on the protein surface around the central hole play important roles in DNA binding.	[]
The novel ring - shaped architecture of the RdgC dimer has significant implications for its role in homologous recombination.	[]
INTRODUCTION	[]
Homologous recombination systems contribute to the maintenance of genome integrity and are essential for the repair of stalled replication forks ( 1).	[]
Genetic studies of the recombination - dependent growth C ( rdgC) gene in bacterial systems have suggested that it is involved in DNA replication and recombination ( 2, 3).	[]
In Neisseria gonorrhoeae ( the gonococcus), RdgC is required for efficient pilin antigenic variation and plays some role in cell growth ( 4, 5).	"Neisseria gonorrhoeae	3	24	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Neisseria gonorrhoeae"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The Escherichia coli rdgC gene encodes a DNA - binding protein of 34 kDa, whose expression level was at its highest during exponential phase, reaching its maximum at ~ 1000 dimers per cell ( 2).	"Escherichia coli	4	20	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Escherichia coli"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Its level decreased sharply to ~ 50 dimers per cell in stationary phase.	[]
This profile suggests that RdgC might function during the period of DNA replication ( 2).	[]
The RecA proteins and their homologs play a key role in recombinational DNA repair in bacteria and eukaryotes.	[]
Their aberrant reactions could result in gross chromosomal rearrangements that lead to human diseases, including cancer.	"human	87	92	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Therefore, their functions must be tightly regulated, and understanding how the RecA family of recombinases is regulated is of utmost importance ( 1).	[]
The E. coli RdgC protein is a potential negative regulator of the function of RecA ( 1).	[]
It inhibits RecA - promoted DNA strand exchange, RecA - mediated ATPase activity and RecA - dependent LexA cleavage ( 1).	[]
Sedimentation equilibrium data indicated that E. coli RdgC exists in solution as a mixture of oligomeric states in equilibrium, most likely monomers, dimers and tetramers ( 1).	[]
This concentration - dependent change in the oligomeric state appears to affect its mode of binding to DNA and its capacity to inhibit RecA ( 1).	[]
The primary mechanism of RdgC inhibition appears to involve a simple competition for DNA - binding sites, especially on double - stranded DNA ( dsDNA) ( 1).	[]
Deletion of the E. coli rdgC gene alone causes no obvious phenotype but is highly deleterious in strains lacking certain enzymes involved in recombination and replication restart ( 2, 3).	[]
RdgC is essential for the growth of an E. coli strain lacking PriA, indicating that it might affect replication fork progression or fork rescue ( 2).	[]
PriA provides a means to load the DnaB replicative helicase at DNA replication fork and D loop structures ( 2).	[]
RdgC is, therefore, a key factor in the rescue of stalled or broken forks and subsequent replication restart.	[]
dnaC suppressors of PriA can overcome this inviability, especially when RecF, RecO or RecR is inactivated, which indicates that RdgC avoids or counters the toxic effect of these proteins by limiting inappropriate RecA loading on SSB - coated ssDNA ( 2).	[]
The DNA - binding ability of the RdgC protein has been demonstrated clearly using electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( 2).	[]
Escherichia coli RdgC binds non - specifically to dsDNA and with higher affinity than ssDNA ( 2).	"Escherichia coli	0	16	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Escherichia coli"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
RdgC from N. meningitidis also binds DNA with little specificity for sequence or structure, like the E. coli protein ( 4).	[]
RdgC exhibits no preference for DNA replication or recombination intermediates ( 2).	[]
However, no detectable domains or nuclease activity could be identified for the E. coli RdgC protein ( 2, 6).	[]
The complexes of E. coli RdgC with both linear and supercoiled circular plasmid DNA were imaged using atomic force microscopy ( 7).	[]
RdgC was found to have an increased affinity to DNA ends and to promote bending of DNA ( 7).	[]
RdgC has the effect on DNA superstructure; the promotion of DNA condensation was observed at high protein concentrations ( 7).	[]
Recombination is largely enhanced by close contacts of distant regions along the DNA strands through condensation ( 7).	[]
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous environmental Gram - negative bacterium that belongs to the gamma subdivision of the Proteobacteria.	"Pseudomonas aeruginosa	0	22	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Pseudomonas aeruginosa"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Orthologs of the rdgC gene are found only in beta and gamma subdivisions of the Proteobacteria ( 2).	[]
The amino acid sequence of P. aeruginosa RdgC, a 306 - residue protein, shows 46 and 36% identities against those of E. coli and N. meningitidis, respectively.	[]
Despite the importance of DNA - binding ability of RdgC in its biological roles, the structural details of RdgC and the mechanism of its action remain unclear.	[]
Here, we report the crystal structure of P. aeruginosa RdgC as determined by the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction ( MAD) method of X - ray crystallography.	[]
It reveals that RdgC dimer is ring - shaped, with a central hole of ~ 30 A diameter.	[]
The inside surface around the central hole is rich in conserved, positively charged residues, which are implicated in DNA - binding by mutagenesis.	[]
We propose that dsDNA binds to RdgC through this central hole.	[]
Our structure provides a solid structural framework for a better understanding of the role of RdgC in homologous recombination.	[]
MATERIALS AND METHODS	[]
Protein expression and purification	[]
The rdgC gene ( PA3263) was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) using the genomic DNA of P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 as a template.	[]
The oligonucleotide primers designed using the published genome sequence ( 8) were 5 ' - G GAA TTC CAT ATG TGG TTC CGC AAT CTG CTC G - 3 ' ( forward) and 5 ' - CCG CCG CTC GAG GAC GCC CTG GGG GAT TTC TTC - 3 ' ( reverse).	[]
The bases in bold denote the NdeI and XhoI cleavage sites, respectively.	[]
The PCR product was digested with NdeI and XhoI, and was then inserted into the NdeI / XhoI - digested expression vector pET - 21a ( +) ( Novagen).	[]
This vector construction adds an eight - residue tag ( LEHHHHHH) to the carboxyl terminus of the gene product to facilitate protein purification.	[]
The protein was expressed in E. coli C41 ( DE3) cells ( 9).	[]
The cells were grown at 37 degrees C up to OD600 of 0. 6 in Luria - Bertani medium that contained 50 mu g ml - 1 ampicillin, and the protein expression was induced by 0. 5 mM isopropyl - beta - d - thiogalactopyranosid ( IPTG).	[]
The cells were allowed to grow at 20 degrees C for 22 h after IPTG induction and were harvested by centrifugation at 4200 g ( 6000 rev min - 1; Sorvall GSA rotor) for 10 min at 4 degrees C.	[]
The cell pellet was resuspended in an ice - cold lysis buffer [ 20 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7. 9), 500 mM sodium chloride, 5 mM imidazole] and was then homogenized with an ultrasonic processor.	[]
The crude cell extract was centrifuged at 36 000 g ( 18 000 rev min - 1; Hanil Supra 21 K rotor) for 60 min at 4 degrees C, and the recombinant protein in the supernatant fraction was purified in three chromatographic steps.	[]
The first purification step utilized the C - terminal hexahistidine - tag by Ni2 + - chelated HiTrap chelating column ( GE Healthcare).	[]
The eluent was diluted 3 - fold with 50 mM Tris - HCl at pH 7. 4.	[]
The diluted solution was applied to a 20 - ml heparin - Sepharose column ( GE Healthcare), which was previously equilibrated with a buffer of 50 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7. 4), 1 mM dithiothreitol and 1 mM EDTA.	[]
The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0 - 2. 0 M sodium chloride in the same buffer.	[]
The first peak corresponded to high molecular aggregates of RdgC and the second peak to RdgC dimers, which was also consistent with our dynamic light scattering measurements.	[]
When the aggregates were not separated from the dimers, the protein readily aggregated within a day.	[]
The dimer fractions were concentrated to ~ 6 mg ml - 1 concentration using an YM10 ultrafiltration membrane ( Millipore - Amicon) and further purified by gel filtration on a HiLoad XK 16 Superdex 200 prep - grade column ( GE Healthcare), which was previously equilibrated with a buffer of 50 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7. 4), 200 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM dithiothreitol and 1 mM EDTA.	[]
The first peak corresponding to the high molecular aggregates of RdgC was only a minor component, and the second peak corresponding to RdgC dimers was stable for several weeks when frozen at - 70 degrees C.	[]
The procedure for purifying the SeMet - substituted protein was the same, except for the presence of 10 mM dithiothreitol in all buffers used during purification steps.	[]
Dynamic light scattering experiments were performed at 24 degrees C, with the protein ( at 2 mg ml - 1 concentration) dissolved in a buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7. 4), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA and 200 mM sodium chloride on a Model DynaPro - 801 instrument ( Wyatt, Santa Barbara, CA, USA).	[]
The protein concentration was estimated by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm, employing the calculated extinction coefficient of 20 910 M - 1 cm - 1 ( SWISS - PROT; http: / / www. expasy. ch /).	[]
Mutagenesis and electrophoretic mobility shift assay	[]
Point mutants were prepared using the QuikChange Site - Directed Mutagenesis kit ( Stratagene), and the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing.	[]
The seven mutants R4A, F120A, K146A, R198A, R208A, Q212A and R252A were well expressed and soluble.	[]
The three mutants K70A, R81A and R211A were not expressed, while R122A mutant was expressed but was not soluble.	[]
Therefore, we mutated Lys70, Arg81, Arg122 and Arg211 into aspartate.	[]
The K70D, R81D, R122D and R211D mutants were well expressed and soluble.	[]
The soluble mutants were expressed and purified under the conditions identical to those for the wild type, except that the heparin - Sepharose column step was omitted.	[]
All of the soluble mutants had similar elution profiles as the wild type upon gel filtration, and the dimer fractions were used for DNA - binding assays.	[]
We mixed 5 mu l of RdgC ( 1. 1 mu g mu l - 1) and 5 mu l of a linear dsDNA with 414 bp ( 63 ng mu l - 1), corresponding to the molar ratio of 64: 1 for RdgC dimer to dsDNA.	[]
The reaction mixtures were incubated for 10 min at room temperature.	[]
RdgC - DNA complexes were analyzed by 1. 5% ( w / v) agarose gel electrophoresis in 1 x TAE buffer ( 45 mM Tris - acetate at pH 8. 3, 1 mM EDTA).	[]
DNA bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining.	[]
For DNA - binding assays, the protein concentration was measured with a Bio - Rad protein assay kit.	[]
Crystallization and X - ray data collection	[]
Crystals were grown by the hanging - drop vapor diffusion method at 24 degrees C by mixing equal volumes ( 2 mu l each) of the protein solution ( at 19 mg ml - 1 concentration in a buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7. 4), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA and 200 mM sodium chloride) and the reservoir solution.	[]
To grow the native crystals, we used a reservoir solution consisting of 0. 1 M sodium HEPES ( pH 7. 5), 1. 0 M tri - sodium citrate and 1% ( w / v) Anapoe ( R) 35 as the detergent.	[]
Native crystals grew to approximate dimensions of 0. 2 mm x 0. 1 mm x 0. 1 mm within a few days.	[]
The SeMet - substituted protein was crystallized under conditions identical to those for the native crystals except for the presence of 10 mM dithiothreitol in the protein solution.	[]
A crystal of the SeMet - substituted protein was dipped into a cryoprotectant solution for a few seconds and was flash - cooled in the cold nitrogen gas stream at 100 K.	[]
The cryoprotectant solution consisted of 0. 1 M sodium HEPES ( pH 7. 5), 1. 0 M tri - sodium citrate, 1% ( w / v) Anapoe ( R) 35 as the detergent and 10% ( v / v) glycerol.	[]
A set of Se MAD data was collected at 100 K at three different wavelengths using an Area Detector System Corporation Quantum 210 charge - coupled device detector at the beamline NW12A of Photon Factory, Tsukuba, Japan.	[]
The crystal was rotated through a total of 180 degrees with a 1 degrees oscillation range per frame.	[]
The raw data were processed and scaled using the program suit HKL2000 ( 10).	[]
The SeMet - substituted crystal belongs to the space group P21212, with unit cell parameters of a = 87. 04 A, b = 115. 60 A and c = 76. 07 A.	[]
The native crystals were soaked for 10 min in 10 mM ethyl mercury thiosalicylate ( EMTS) to collect a set of Hg MAD data at four different wavelengths.	[]
X - ray diffraction data from the EMTS - derivatized crystal, as well as a native crystal, were collected on a Bruker charge - coupled device detector at the beamline BL - 6B of Pohang Light Source, Pohang, Korea.	[]
The EMTS - soaked crystal belongs to the space group P21212, with unit cell parameters of a = 87. 16 A, b = 116. 02 A and c = 74. 97 A.	[]

Structure solution and refinement	[]
Heavy atom sites were located with the program SOLVE ( 11).	[]
Four Se sites from the SeMet - substituted crystal and two Hg sites from the EMTS - soaked crystal were located.	[]
Two sets of the initial Se and Hg MAD phases were separately improved using the program RESOLVE ( 12).	[]
Two electron density maps were independently interpreted, and the fragments of the two models were combined into a single model, since the two maps were complementary to each other.	[]
Non - crystallographic symmetry ( NCS) matrices were found from a partial model built from the initial electron density map, and phases were further improved by the 2 - fold NCS averaging, solvent flattening and histogram matching with the program DM ( 13).	[]
The model was built with O ( 14).	[]
The model was refined with the program CNS ( 15), including the bulk solvent correction.	[]
10% of the data were randomly set aside as the test data for the calculation of Rfree ( 16).	[]
Several rounds of model building, simulated annealing, positional refinement and individual B - factor refinement were performed.	[]
Subsequently, this model was used to refine the structure of the native protein.	[]
The model has excellent stereochemistry, as evaluated by the program PROCHECK ( 17).	[]
Refinement statistics are summarized in Supplementary Table 1.	[]
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION	[]
Model quality and monomer structure	[]
The structure of P. aeruginosa RdgC was solved using two sets of MAD data collected from a crystal of the selenomethionine ( SeMet) - substituted protein and from a mercury derivative crystal of the native protein ( Supplementary Table 1).	[]
The model has subsequently been refined using the 20. 0 - 2. 50 A data from a native crystal to crystallographic Rwork and Rfree values of 23. 4 and 27. 9%, respectively, with no sigma cut - off.	[]
The refined model contains 612 residues of the two monomers in the asymmetric unit of the crystal ( residues 1 - 306 for both chains A and B) and 87 water molecules.	[]
The C - terminal eight - residue fusion tag has no electron density in both subunits and has not been modeled.	[]
Conformations of the two monomers in the asymmetric unit are similar.	[]
The root - mean - square ( r. m. s.) difference between the two monomers is 0. 69 A for 306 C alpha atom pairs, with a maximum deviation of 8. 8 A for the C alpha atom of Gly305.	[]
The residues giving r. m. s. differences larger than 2. 0 A are 14 - 16, 94 - 96, 201 - 202 and 303 - 306, which correspond to loops connecting secondary structure elements or the C - terminus.	[]
They are located on the surface of the dimer.	[]
Subunit A has a better map quality than subunit B, and thus has a lower mean B - factor than subunit B ( 40. 3 A 2 versus. 56. 1 A 2 for all 4788 atoms) ( Supplementary Figure 1).	[]
Therefore, subunit A is chosen for discussions, unless otherwise stated.	[]
The P. aeruginosa RdgC monomer is J - shaped and has approximate dimensions of 72 A x 60 A x 40 A ( Figure 1).	[]
It can be divided into three structural domains: center domain, tip domain and base domain.	[]
Center domain ( residues 1 - 73 and 121 - 167) includes a six - stranded anti - parallel beta - sheet with two flanking alpha helices ( alpha 1 and alpha 4).	[]
The helix alpha 1 runs nearly parallel to the two outermost strands beta 2 and beta 3, which in turn lie adjacent to beta 4.	[]
Strands beta 2 and beta 3 are separated by a loop.	[]
The helix alpha 4 is nearly orthogonal to the beta - strands.	[]
Tip domain ( residues 74 - 120) contains two alpha helices ( alpha 2 and alpha 3) and is inserted between strands beta 4 and beta 5 of the center domain.	[]
It sticks out from the center domain.	[]
The two connections between the center domain and the tip domain are rich in conserved residues, hinting at an important functional role of these joints.	[]
They could act as a hinge for a possible conformational change.	[]
The C - terminal region of the polypeptide chain is folded into the base domain ( residues 168 - 306), which consists of a five - stranded anti - parallel beta - sheet with four alpha - helices, three of which ( alpha 5, alpha 6 and alpha 8) cover one side of the beta - sheet.	[]
The long helix alpha 8 is slightly bent.	[]
Structural similarity searches	[]
When we searched for structural similarity against the Protein Data Bank database using the program DALI ( 18), the P. aeruginosa RdgC monomer showed no significant similarity with a Z score above 5.	[]
Therefore, we conclude that the overall fold of the RdgC polypeptide chain is unique.	[]
When we elaborated the structural comparisons with individual domains of P. aeruginosa RdgC, only the center domain gave a Z score above 5.	[]
Using the center domain ( residues 1 - 73 and 121 - 167) alone, the highest structural similarity is found with the human beta 2 - adaptin appendage domain ( PDB code 1E42, Z score = 7. 1, r. m. s. deviation = 2. 5 A for 85 structurally aligned residues, residues 1 - 12, 14 - 30, 44 - 47, 58 - 72, 122 - 133 and 135 - 160 of P. aeruginosa RdgC chain A and residues 838 - 841, 848 - 880, 885 - 906 and 912 - 967 of the human beta 2 - adaptin appendage domain chain A) ( 19).	"human	116	121	Organism/Species"	"human	116	121	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
There does not appear to be any functional relatedness between these two proteins.	[]
The next highest similarity is found with the yeast TATA - box - binding protein ( PDB code 1YTB, Z score = 5. 7, r. m. s. deviation = 2. 6 A for 79 structurally aligned residues, residues 4 - 12, 14 - 19, 21 - 27, 56 - 70, 124 - 132 and 134 - 166 of P. aeruginosa RdgC chain A and residues 69 - 96, 100 - 126 and 132 - 155 of TATA - box - binding protein, N - terminal half of chain A) ( 20).	"yeast	46	51	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""yeast"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The TATA - box - binding protein is composed of a ten - stranded antiparallel beta - sheet with four flanking alpha - helices on the convex side of the beta - sheet ( 20).	[]
It has an internal quasi 2 - fold symmetry, and its beta - strands are involved in DNA binding.	[]
There is, however, no structural similarity of functional significance, because the two center domains of the RdgC dimer are well separated and do not associate into a single unit ( Figure 1C and D).	[]
Using the tip domain ( residues 74 - 120) alone, the ATPase domain of bovine Hsc70 chaperone shows highest structural similarity ( PDB code 1BA1, Z score = 4. 8, r. m. s. deviation = 1. 7 A for 45 structurally aligned residues, residues 76 - 120 of P. aeruginosa RdgC chain A and residues 230 - 253 and 256 - 276 of the Hsc70 ATPase domain) ( 21).	"bovine	70	76	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bovine"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
There does not seem to be any significant functional relationship between these two proteins.	[]
The alpha - helix - loop - alpha - helix structure of the tip domain is reminiscent of the helix - hairpin - helix ( HhH) DNA - binding motif that is present in a number of DNA repair enzymes ( 22 - 25).	[]
The HhH motifs are characterized by the conserved sequence motif hxxhxGhGxxxAxxxhh, where h is any hydrophobic residue ( VILMWFYA) and x any residue ( 23).	[]
Two conserved glycines allow a tight turn between two alpha - helices.	[]
However, the tip domain of P. aeruginosa RdgC protein does not have such a sequence motif, and the loop in the RdgC tip domain is much more extended than that of the HhH motifs.	[]
Therefore, the RdgC tip domain is uniquely folded.	[]
With the base domain ( residues 168 - 306) alone, the highest similarity is found with P. aeruginosa isochorismate - pyruvate lyase ( unpublished deposition; PDB code 2H9C, Z score = 4. 0, r. m. s. deviation = 4. 8 A for 51 structurally aligned residues, residues 186 - 191, 237 - 240, 257 - 272 and 274 - 298 of P. aeruginosa RdgC chain A and residues 36 - 41, 50 - 53, 55 - 66 and 68 - 96 of P. aeruginosa isochorismate - pyruvate lyase chain A).	[]
There does not appear to be any functional relationship between the two proteins, and the base domain of RdgC is uniquely folded.	[]
The 101 - residue chain of P. aeruginosa isochorismate - pyruvate lyase is folded into three alpha - helices, two of which overlap with two alpha - helices ( alpha 2 and alpha 3) of the base domain of RdgC.	[]
Ring - shaped dimer structure and inter - subunit interface	[]
Our structure reveals that P. aeruginosa RdgC forms a ring - shaped dimer of approximate 2 - fold symmetry in the crystal ( Figure 1).	[]
This observation is consistent with the results of previous gel filtration and sedimentation equilibrium experiments, which suggested the presence of dimeric species of E. coli RdgC in solution ( 1, 2).	[]
Depending on the concentration, RdgC could also exist in solution as monomers, tetramers and higher oligomers ( 1).	[]
In the crystal lattice, no monomeric, trimeric or tetrameric species exist.	[]
Our structure unequivocally rules out the monomer - trimer model, which fits the sedimentation equilibrium data approximately, as well as the monomer - dimer - tetramer model ( 1).	[]
The RdgC dimer has approximate dimensions of 80 A x 60 A x 40 A, with a central hole of ~ 30 A diameter.	[]
Only a moderate amount of surface area is buried upon the formation of the RdgC dimer.	[]
The monomer - monomer interface buries a solvent - accessible surface area of ~ 1360 A 2 per monomer, corresponding to ~ 8% of the total surface area of the monomer ( Protein - Protein Interaction Server at http: / / www. biochem. ucl. ac. uk / bsm / PP / server /).	[]
Polar and nonpolar atoms in interface are 44 and 56%, respectively.	[]
The interface can be divided into two kinds: ' interface A ' involving both the tip domains and center domains, and ' interface B ' involving the base domains ( Figure 2A).	[]
These two interfaces have significantly different characters.	[]
The interface A is formed largely by the crossing over of the two tip domains in the dimer ( Figure 1).	[]
This interface covers a surface area of ~ 565 A 2 and is largely nonpolar, with the polar and nonpolar atoms in the interface being 37. 5 and 2. 5%, respectively.	[]
Phe120 contributes considerably to the nonpolar character of the interface between the tip domains, accounting for ~ 150 A 2 of the interface area.	[]
Phe120 is part of a highly conserved sequence segment and lies at the boundary between the tip domain and the center domain.	[]
The aromatic ring of Phe120 ' inserts into a hydrophobic pocket, which is formed by the hydrophobic residues Ile74, Leu75, Pro76, Val79, Leu115, Ala119 and Phe120 of the neighboring monomer ( Figure 2B).	[]
The primed residue belongs to the adjacent subunit.	[]
These residues are well conserved in the RdgC family ( indicated by green triangles below the aligned sequences in Figure 3).	[]
As these hydrophobic residues are located near the molecular 2 - fold axis, the two clusters of hydrophobic side chains are merged into a single, large cluster in the dimer ( Figure 2B).	[]
Of the 16 hydrogen bonds that exist between the two subunits, only one is made in this interface between Arg118 and Arg118 '.	[]
The interface B is contributed to exclusively by the two base domains.	[]
This interface covers a surface area of ~ 795 A 2.	[]
The polar and nonpolar atoms in this interface are 50% each.	[]
The two beta - sheets of the two base domains merge into a single ten - stranded antiparallel beta - sheet in this interface ( Figure 2A).	[]
Thus, 15 of 16 inter - subunit hydrogen bonds are clustered in this interface.	[]
The hydrogen bond networks can be divided into two types.	[]
The first type involves the main chain atoms of Val206, Arg208 and Lys210 in strand beta 9; this strand associates with the equivalent strand from the other subunit in an antiparallel manner ( Figure 2C).	[]
The other type involves both the side chain and main chain atoms.	[]
The side chain of Arg211 ' interacts with the backbone of Gly204, while the side chain of Lys227 hydrogen bonds to those of both Gln212 ' and Glu218 ( Figure 2D).	[]
In addition, the side chain of Gln212 ' interacts with that of Asp199 and the backbone of Arg211 ' ( Figure 2D).	[]
Arg211, Gln212, Glu218 and Lys227 are highly conserved among the RdgC family members.	[]
The residues participating in the hydrogen bond networks are indicated by red circles below the aligned sequences in Figure 3.	[]
The observation that conserved residues play important roles in forming the dimer implies that dimerization of RdgC is critical for its function.	[]
If one or both of interfaces A and B are to be broken for functional reasons such as for allowing dsDNA to enter into the central hole of the RdgC dimer, we can conceive of three scenarios.	[]
The first possibility would be a simultaneous breakage of the two interfaces A and B.	[]
The second would be the sequential disruption of the interfaces A and B.	[]
The third would be the disruption of only one of the two interfaces A and B.	[]
Sedimentation equilibrium indicated the presence of monomers in solution ( 1), which is consistent with the first two scenarios.	[]
If the third scenario holds, RdgC dimers could possibly exist in two conformations in solution, i. e. a closed form as observed in the present crystal structure, and an open form, in which one of the two interfaces A and B is broken.	[]
A model for DNA binding by RdgC and DNA - binding assay	[]
The net charge of P. aeruginosa RdgC is highly negative, since each monomer contains 12 aspartate, 13 glutamate, 10 lysine, 9 arginine and 2 histidine residues.	[]
The net charge of a dimer would be - 12 ( or - 8), if we assume none ( or all) of histidines to be positively charged.	[]
The electrostatic potential at the molecular surface of RdgC dimer shows that the charge distribution on the protein surface is highly nonuniform ( Figure 4A).	[]
Since the inner surface of the RdgC dimer is rich in conserved, positively charged residues and the diameter of the central hole ( ~ 30 A) is approximately similar to that of other toroidal DNA - binding proteins ( 26), it appears likely that RdgC dimers bind dsDNA through the central hole.	[]
Despite extensive co - crystallization and soaking trials with linear dsDNAs of different lengths ( 14 - mer, 16 - mer and 18 - mer), we could not locate the bound DNA experimentally.	[]
We attribute this difficulty to the nature of sequence - nonspecific DNA binding by RdgC.	[]
Therefore, we built a crude model of a DNA complex of the RdgC dimer by fitting dsDNA into the central hole ( Figure 4B).	[]
This model is supported by the DNA - binding assays coupled with mutagenesis, as described below.	[]
It is also consistent with the suggested binding site size of ~ 16 nt for the E. coli RdgC dimer ( 1) and the approximate thickness ( ~ 40 A) of the P. aeruginosa RdgC dimer.	[]
When we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assay for dsDNA binding, P. aeruginosa RdgC did not require Mg2 + ions ( Supplementary Figure 2), unlike Deinococcus radiodurans RecR, which required high concentrations of Mg2 + ions ( 27).	"Deinococcus radiodurans	154	177	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Deinococcus radiodurans"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 177, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
ATP was not required for dsDNA binding by P. aeruginosa RdgC, either ( Supplementary Figure 2).	[]
This is consistent with an apparent lack of an ATP - binding pocket in the RdgC dimer structure.	[]
In order to identify the residues that are important for dsDNA binding, we carried out mutational analyses.	[]
The residues for mutagenesis were selected on the basis of the modeled complex between RdgC dimer and dsDNA, together with sequence conservation ( Figure 4C).	[]
We prepared eleven point mutants ( R4A, K70D, R81D, F120A, R122D, K146A, R198A, R208A, R211D, Q212A and R252A).	[]
These eleven mutated residues are well conserved among RdgC proteins.	[]
Eight mutants ( R4A, K70D, R81D, R122D, K146A, R198A, R208A and R252A) had a lower affinity for dsDNA than the wild - type RdgC ( Figure 4D).	[]
These eight mutated residues are indicated by blue squares below the aligned sequences in Figure 3.	[]
This result indicates that dsDNA binds to the inside surface around the central hole of the RdgC dimer, since the mutated residues are located on the inner surface of the RdgC dimer.	[]
It is worth mentioning that a single mutation introduces two alterations per RdgC dimer.	[]
The three mutants ( F120A, R211D and Q212A) were prepared to investigate whether dimerization of RdgC is crucial for dsDNA binding.	[]
Phe120 is a key residue located in the inter - subunit interface A ( Figure 2B), while Arg211 makes hydrogen bonds in the interface B ( Figure 2D) and Gln212 is involved in both intra - and inter - subunit interactions ( Figure 2D).	[]
dsDNA binding by the F120A mutant is considerably weakened, compared to either the R211D or Q212A mutant ( Figure 4D).	[]
This result suggests that destabilization of the ring - shaped architecture of the RdgC dimer is deleterious for tight dsDNA binding and that interface A is probably more important than interface B for dsDNA binding.	[]
dsDNA - binding affinity of the Q212A mutant was lower than the wild type ( Figure 4D), whereas that of the R211D mutant was comparable to the wild type ( Figure 4D).	[]
This result suggests that disruption of the inter - subunit interface B is also detrimental for dsDNA binding but to a smaller extent than disruption of the interface A.	[]
It further suggests that the side chain of Arg211 is not involved in recognizing dsDNA.	[]
It is interesting that the DNA complex for wild type forms a distinct band ( lane 3 in Figure 4D), as opposed to a more diffuse band as one would expect if the complexes contained different numbers of RdgC dimers.	[]
Assuming a binding site size of ~ 16 nt ( 1), the 414 - bp duplex DNA would bind ~ 25 RdgC dimers if it is fully saturated.	[]
RdgC is unique among ring - shaped DNA - binding proteins	[]
Pseudomonas aeruginosa RdgC adds a unique member to the repertoire of toroidal DNA - binding proteins ( 26) such as D. radiodurans RecR ( 27) and DNA polymerase processivity factors, including the beta subunit of E. coli DNA polymerase III ( 28), gp45 of T4 DNA polymerase ( 29) and PCNA of eukaryotic DNA polymerase delta ( 30, 31) ( Figure 5).	"Pseudomonas aeruginosa	0	22	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Pseudomonas aeruginosa"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
These proteins do not have an overall sequence similarity among themselves, and their quaternary structures also vary.	[]
P. aeruginosa RdgC and E. coli beta clamp are homodimers, T4 gp45 and eukaryotic PCNAs are homotrimers and D. radiodurans RecR is a homotetramer.	[]
In P. aeruginosa RdgC, the inner surface of the ring - shaped dimer is largely formed by beta - strands, while the outer surface of the ring is mostly formed by alpha - helices ( Figure 5).	[]
The predicted DNA - binding site of P. aeruginosa RdgC dimer is primarily formed by beta - strands and loops.	[]
In contrast, in other ring - shaped DNA - binding proteins such as the beta subunit of E. coli DNA polymerase III ( 28), gp45 of T4 DNA polymerase ( 29), PCNA of eukaryotic DNA polymerases delta ( 30, 31) and D. radiodurans RecR ( 27), alpha - helices are located toward the center of the ring and are surrounded by beta - strands in the outermost side of the ring ( Figure 5).	[]
Despite a superficial resemblance of the overall ring - shaped architecture of the RdgC dimer with those of other toroidal DNA - binding proteins, the internal arrangement of the secondary structure elements in the RdgC dimer is strikingly different from those of other toroidal DNA - binding proteins.	[]
Thus, RdgC is unique among ring - shaped DNA - binding proteins.	[]
A number of other proteins involved in DNA metabolism also adopt a ring - shaped structure despite diversity in the molecular functions ( 26).	[]
They include NAD + - dependent DNA ligase ( 25), lambda exonuclease ( 32), hexameric helicases, topoisomerases, the trp RNA - binding attenuation protein, the bacteriophage head - to - tail connector and translin ( 26).	[]
There are also many examples of the proteins in DNA recombination pathways that assemble into multi - subunit toroids containing a central channel ( 26).	[]
Electron microscopy showed that the E. coli RuvB protein, in the presence of ATP, forms a dodecamer on double - stranded DNA in which two stacked hexameric rings encircle the DNA and are oriented in opposite directions with D6 symmetry ( 33).	[]
The human RAD52 protein was found to assemble into heptameric rings with a large funnel - shaped channel, 40 - 60 A in diameter ( 34).	"human	4	9	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The human DMC1 protein has so far been detected only as an octameric ring ( 35).	"human	4	9	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Inhibition mechanism of RecA function by RdgC	[]
RdgC inhibits RecA - promoted DNA strand exchange, RecA - mediated ATPase activity and RecA - dependent LexA cleavage ( 1).	[]
It was observed that the effects of RdgC on RecA - promoted DNA strand exchange were much more pronounced than the effects of RdgC on other RecA functions, when RdgC was added to the reaction late ( 1).	[]
By examining the effects of the DinI protein on RdgC - mediated inhibition of RecA activities, it was concluded that the potent effect of RdgC in the inhibition of strand exchange did not primarily reflect a displacement of RecA in the nucleoprotein filament by RdgC, but instead a binding of RdgC to the dsDNA substrate so as to make it unavailable to the filaments for strand exchange ( 1).	[]
Our work contributes to a better understanding of the inhibition mechanism of RecA function by RdgC.	[]
The ring - shaped architecture with a central hole that is suitable for the binding of dsDNA lends RdgC with a capacity to hold dsDNA very tightly.	[]
Therefore, we suggest that RdgC dimers probably function as a tight dsDNA gripper and physically block access to the target dsDNA by RecA filaments, because tight encircling of dsDNA by RdgC dimers, possibly as a linear aggregate, would prevent the two strands from dissociating.	[]
However, it remains unclear how the closed - ring structure of the RdgC dimer might allow binding of a large number of RdgC dimers on the duplex DNA.	[]
It may be conceivable that each RdgC dimer can open temporarily at one or both of its two inter - subunit interfaces so that dsDNA can enter the central hole.	[]
RdgC was at its highest level during exponential phase, reaching its maximum of ~ 1000 dimers per E. coli cell.	[]
Its level decreased sharply to ~ 50 dimers per cell in stationary phase ( 2).	[]
Under normal cellular conditions, RecA is maintained at ~ 1000 molecules per cell ( http: / / www. els. net /).	[]
Following LexA repressor cleavage, the level of RecA protein in the cell increases by as much as 20 - fold.	[]
RdgC inhibition of the RecA function by a simple competition mechanism at the cellular concentration of RdgC clearly requires a much higher affinity for DNA by RdgC than RecA.	[]
Possible protein - protein interactions between RdgC dimers might have a profound effect on the affinity for DNA, when a large number of RdgC dimers are bound on a duplex DNA.	[]
If only one of the two inter - subunit interfaces can open up and the 2 - fold symmetry axes of the RdgC dimers are misaligned sufficiently, the escape of DNA from a linear array of interacting RdgC dimers would be extremely difficult.	[]
Alternatively, both inter - subunit interfaces of each dimer may open up simultaneously.	[]
A line of indirect evidence for the possible protein - protein interactions between RdgC dimers is provided by the cooperative binding of RdgC to DNA ( 7).	[]
Cooperativity of RdgC binding may be caused by local and distant protein - protein interactions ( 7).	[]
A kind of side - by - side interaction between two adjacent molecules of RdgC dimer is present in the crystal, burying an accessible surface area of ~ 750 A 2 at the interface.	[]
The interaction involves mostly the less polar side surface of the dimer ( left side of Figure 4A), with 2 - fold symmetry axes of the two interacting RdgC molecules making an angle of ~ 90 degrees when viewed down the central holes and ~ 15 degrees when viewed perpendicular to the holes.	[]
This may explain the observed DNA bending by RdgC, which was speculated to be a necessary step in the working mechanism of RdgC, if one can assume that the strong protein - protein interactions in the crystal were relevant for protein - protein interactions in solution ( 7).	[]
RdgC protein was shown to have a potent effect on RecA protein - promoted DNA strand exchange in E. coli ( 1).	[]
In a series of experiments, RdgC was added after RecA filaments had formed on the ssDNA and 5 min after the linear dsDNA was added.	[]
With 3 mu M RecA, a sharp reduction in DNA strand exchange products was seen with 0. 4 mu M RdgC, and the generation of products was abolished at 0. 8 mu M RdgC ( 1).	[]
This suggests that the binding affinity of RdgC to dsDNA is considerably higher than that of RecA.	[]
The high affinity of RdgC could be explained by its ring shape and the suggested mode of DNA binding.	[]
Tetrameric species of E. coli RdgC, which started to form at around 2 micro M concentrations, were speculated to be the species with the most potent inhibitory effect, possibly by having a higher affinity for DNA ( 1).	[]
Higher affinity for DNA of the tetrameric species could be understood, if the formation of a tetramer in solution involves a protein - protein interaction similar to the side - by - side interaction between two adjacent RdgC dimers in the crystal, although there is no experimental evidence.	[]
Obviously, there are still many open questions that need to be addressed in future biochemical experiments.	[]
SUMMARY	[]
The crystal structure of RdgC, a recombination - associated DNA - binding protein, determined in this study reveals that the polypeptide chain is uniquely folded and two monomers associate to form a ring - shaped dimer with a central hole of ~ 30 A diameter.	[]
The inner surface around the central hole is rich in positively charged residues.	[]
These structural features suggest that dsDNA runs through the central hole when it binds to RdgC dimers.	[]
This idea is supported by our mutational studies, which indicate that the conserved, positively charged residues around the central hole are important for dsDNA binding.	[]
The toroidal architecture of the RdgC dimer provides a sound framework for a better understanding of its role in homologous recombination.	[]

Port site herniation of the small bowel following laparoscopy - assisted distal gastrectomy: a case report	[]
Abstract	[]
Introduction	[]
Port - site herniation is a rare but potentially dangerous complication after laparoscopic surgery.	[]
Closure of port sites, especially those measuring 10 mm or more, has been recommended to avoid such an event.	[]
Case presentation	[]
We herein report the only case of a port site hernia among a series 52 consecutive cases of laparoscopy - assisted distal gastrectomy ( LADG) carried out by our unit between July 2002 and March 2007.	[]
In this case the small bowel herniated and incarcerated through the port site on day 4 after LADG despite closure of the fascia.	[]
Initial manifestations experienced by the patient, possibly due to obstruction, and including mild abdominal pain and nausea, occurred on the third day postoperatively.

The definitive diagnosis was made on day 4 based on symptoms related to leakage from the duodenal stump, which was considered to have developed after severe obstruction of the bowel.	[]
Re - operation for reduction of the incarcerated bowel and tube duodenostomy with peritoneal drainage were required to manage this complication.	[]
Conclusion	[]
We present this case report and review of literature to discuss further regarding methods of fascial closure after laparoscopic surgery.	[]
Introduction	[]
Bowel herniation through the fascial defect created by the entry of trocars is now recognized as a rare but potentially serious complication of laparoscopic surgery [ 1].	[]
Although port site herniation is an infrequent complication, there are still some reports of port site herniation after these procedures, even with closure of trocar sites [ 1, 2].	[]
The following report describes a case of a trocar site hernia that evolved into leakage from the duodenal stump after laparoscopy - assisted distal gastrectomy ( LADG).	[]
Progression occurred because of complete obstruction of the incarcerated bowel after a Roux - en - Y reconstruction.	[]
We describe the significance of complete closure of the fascial defect at the trocar site including the peritoneum in the prevention of this condition, as well as the importance of early diagnosis to avoid serious subsequent events.	[]
Case presentation	[]
An 80 - year - old man was found to have early gastric cancer during his yearly check - up by gastrointestinal endoscopy.	"man	19	22	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""man"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
He was 158 cm in height and weighed 62 kg.	[]
Gastrointestinal endoscopy showed a depressed lesion that was diagnosed as early gastric cancer by pathological examination of biopsy specimens.	[]
He underwent LADG with regional lymph node dissection ( D1 including the nodes surrounding the origin of left gastric artery).	[]
A 12 - mm trocar for the laparoscope was placed in the umbilicus.	[]
Pneumoperitoneum was then established with carbon dioxide and the intraperitoneal pressure was maintained at 10 mm Hg.	[]
Two more 12 - mm trocars were inserted in the midclavicular line below the costal margin and 2 cm above the umbilicus on each of both flanks and were used for active surgical instruments.	[]
All trocars used were the non - bladed type.	[]
The specimen was removed through a small medial incision which was 55 mm in length placed after resection of the stomach, and then Roux - en - Y reconstruction ( RY) was carried out ( Fig. 1).	[]
A tubular shaped drainage tube 10 mm in diameter was inserted and placed through the upper trocar site made on the right flank.	[]
Wound defect at the umbilical port site was sutured completely including the peritoneum with 0 absorbable suture and fascial incisions at all other trocar insertion sites were closed with 2 - 0 absorbable sutures.	[]
Surgical duration was 263 min, and the volume of blood loss was less than 50 mL with no blood transfusion.	[]
Postoperatively, the patient complained of an acidic feeling in his stomach; however, there were no remarkable abnormalities on biochemical examination of serum.	"patient	21	28	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Radiological findings did not suggest bowel obstruction until 3 days postoperatively, although mild symptoms such as general malaise and vague abdominal pain were reported on day three.	[]
However, on day 4, the patient started to complain of upper abdominal pain and developed a high grade fever ( 38 degrees C).	"patient	23	30	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Complete obstruction of the small bowel and leakage of contrast media were demonstrated by Gastrografin swallow and subsequent abdominal computed tomography ( CT).	[]
CT also showed a mass lesion at the trocar insertion site on the upper left flank, suggesting herniation through the port site ( Fig. 2).	[]
Marked dilatation of the duodenum including the horizontal part and second portion was observed.	[]
A diagnosis of staple failure of the stump of the duodenum and port - site herniation of the small bowel was made, and exploratory laparotomy was carried out.	[]
A small medial incision that had been made at the initial surgery was extended downward to the umbilicus to open the peritoneal cavity.	[]
As we expected, the small bowel was incarcerated into the peritoneal defect in the abdominal wall created by the trocar placed in the left upper flank leading to complete obstruction of the bowel ( Fig. 3).	[]
Part of the jejunum 30 cm distal from the ligament of Treitz herniated around the fascial stitch, which still existed at the time of the re - exploration.	[]
The peritoneal cavity was contaminated with intestinal juice.	[]
Close examination after reduction of the incarcerated bowel did not demonstrate necrosis of the intestine, and thus, we decided not to resect this lesion.	[]
Leakage of intestinal juice through a pinhole fistula at the duodenal stump was also observed.	[]
Tube duodenostomy was performed with an omental patch used for closure of the fistula.	[]
The peritoneal defect was also closed.	[]
The postoperative course was fairly good without high output of the intestinal juice leakage or sepsis.	[]
The patient remained in the intensive care unit for 5 days after re - operation, and was then transferred to the general ward.	"patient	4	11	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Discussion	[]
Port - site herniation, which is one of the major complications after laparoscopic procedures [ 1], sometimes develops into serious complications, such as bowel obstruction due to incarceration into the fascial defect at the port site.	[]
Boughey et al. have reported four cases of Richter ' s hernia that occurred at a port site after laparoscopic surgery [ 1].	[]
They reviewed previous reports and found the incidence to be 0. 2 to 3%.	[]
A report describes the incidence of hernia as 0. 23% for 10 - mm trocar use, rising to 3. 1% for the 12 - mm trocar [ 2] suggesting that the wound created by a larger port carries a greater risk of herniation.	[]
Most surgeons now routinely close the fascia of port sites to prevent this complication [ 2].	[]
According to previous reports, port site herniation apparently happens more often with the use of bladed type trocars than non - bladed type trocars [ 3].	[]
Indeed, Kolata demonstrated that the wounds made by the non - bladed trocar were narrower than those created by cutting tip trocars in a pig experimental model [ 4].	"pig	137	140	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""pig"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Several reports even concluded that port sites created by non - bladed trocars do not require fascial closure [ 3].	[]
However, the current case suggests that thick preperitoneum is a potential space that allows for the development of bowel herniation even with the use of non - bladed type trocars.	[]
A previous report also described port - site herniation, despite the closure of the superficial layer of the fascial defect [ 5].	[]
The current case did not demonstrate any of the risk factors suggested previously [ 6]; 1) enlargement of a port site to remove specimen; 2) glucose intolerance; 3) obesity; or 4) extensive manipulation of the trocar during relatively prolonged surgical duration, which might have enlarged the trocar site and thus induced bowel herniation.	[]
Therefore, we recommend closing the fascial defect, including the peritoneum, especially if the trocar size is more than 10 - mm and in the presence of any of the risk factors described above.	[]
However, it is sometimes difficult to completely close the defect, including the peritoneum, especially in obese patients.	"patients	113	121	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Shaher reviewed different wound closure techniques by a literature search [ 7].	[]
In this review, old methods using classical instruments including Deschamps needle are also useful as well as special wound devices designed for port site closure.	[]
Elashry et al. described a prospective randomized study demonstrating that the Carter - Thomason device was faster and resulted in fewer port - closure - related complications among eight different techniques tested [ 8].	[]
Insertion of a SURGICEL plug into the muscular layer of trocar wounds has also been proposed by Chiu et al [ 9].	[]
Alternatively, tangential insertion of a trocar through the abdominal wall might be effective in reducing the size of fascial defects.	[]
Moreover, recent publications have demonstrated that radially expanding type trocars could be useful to avoid the necessity of closing the fascial defect [ 10].	[]
Symptoms of trocar - site herniation vary depending on the severity of bowel obstruction.	[]
Mild symptoms such as slight nausea and vague abdominal pain, both of which are most frequently seen in the early normal postoperative course after abdominal surgery, could be the first and only complaints at the early stage of this complication.	[]
Thus, the diagnosis may be delayed.	[]
In our case, mild abdominal pain with general malaise might have been symptoms related to the early stage of the onset.	[]
Abdominal CT showing the enlarged duodenum also suggested that leakage from the duodenal stump occurred due to the obstruction of the distal bowel.	[]
Thus, severe complication might have been avoided, if early diagnosis had been made.	[]
Although the benefit of Roux - en - Y is apparent [ 11], the duodenal stump could be vulnerable to leakage due to increased intrabowel pressure.	[]
Therefore, careful management of the postoperative course is warranted, especially after procedures involving division of the bowel such as LADG.	[]
Moreover, special attention should be paid in patients with risk factors for port site hernia such as obesity, aggressive manipulation through the port sites, and prolonged surgery.

Conclusion	[]
Port - site herniation is a potentially dangerous complication after laparoscopic procedures.	[]
Careful management of the postoperative course is recommended especially for patients with risk factors such as obesity and extensive manipulation of the trocar during prolonged surgical duration.

Comparison of strategies for identification of regulatory quantitative trait loci of transcript expression traits	[]
Abstract	[]
In order to identify regulatory genes, we determined the heritability of gene transcripts, performed linkage analysis to identify quantitative trait loci ( QTLs), and evaluated the evidence for shared genetic effects among transcripts with co - localized QTLs in non - diseased participants from 14 CEPH ( Centre d ' Etude du Polymorphisme Humain) Utah families.	"participants	278	290	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""participants"", ""start_span"": 278, ""end_span"": 290, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Seventy - six percent of transcripts had a significant heritability and 54% of them had LOD score > = 1. 8.	[]
Bivariate genetic analysis of 15 transcripts that had co - localized QTLs on 4q28. 2 - q31. 1 identified significant genetic correlation among some transcripts although no improvement in the magnitude of LOD scores in this region was noted.	[]
Similar results were found in analysis of 12 transcripts, that had co - localized QTLs in the 13q34 region.	[]
Principal - component analyses did not improve the ability to identify chromosomal regions of co - localized gene expressions.	[]
Background	[]
There is a breadth of information being generated by the Human Genome Project and the interpretation of these data has been a major area of research.	"Human	57	62	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Human"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
For simple Mendelian disorders, the identification of genetic effects is fairly straightforward due to understanding the biology that drives these disorders.	[]
However, for complex oligogenic or polygenic disorders, understanding all the interconnections between genes influencing a trait is a difficult task because the understanding of the biology of many of these disorders is still evolving.	[]
Multiple gene x gene and gene x environment interactions can influence the expression of phenotypes.	[]
Genes can interact by modifying the expression of other genes and therefore function as regulatory genes [ 1].	[]
In an effort to dissect some of these complexities, we performed linkage analysis of gene expression transcripts of members of Centre d ' Etude du Polymorphisme Humain ( CEPH) Utah families to determine the heritability of transcripts and the evidence for regulatory quantitative trait loci ( QTLs) and we performed pairwise bivariate linkage analysis and principal - component analysis ( PCA) for data - reduction to evaluate the evidence for shared genetic effects.	[]
The ability to assess gene expression traits simultaneously and to link them to QTLs offers the possibility of identifying previously unknown underlying molecular processes for future investigation.	[]
Methods	[]
Population and phenotypes	[]
We used the Genetic Analysis Workshop 15 ( GAW 15) Problem 1 microarray gene expression profiles for the analyses.	[]
Data were available for 14 three - generation CEPH Utah families.	[]
Expression levels of genes were obtained from lymphoblastoid cells using the Affymetrix Human Focus Arrays [ 2].	"Human	88	93	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Human"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We were provided with data on 3554 transcripts that showed greater variation between individuals than within the same individual.	[]
Family members were genotyped for 2882 autosomal and X - linked single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNP) generated by the SNP Consortium.	[]
Genetic map positions were obtained using the SNP Mapping web application developed by the University College Dublin Conway Institute of Biomolecular and Biomedical Research, which uses the Rutgers Combined Linkage - Physical Map of the Human Genome and data taken from the NCBI dbSNP Build 123 ( in Kosambi centimorgans).	"Human	237	242	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Human"", ""start_span"": 237, ""end_span"": 242, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This information was used to calculate multipoint identity by descent matrices ( MIBDs) with Merlin and Minx [ 3], after removal of Mendelian inconsistencies and double recombinants with Preswalk ( based on Simwalk mistyping probabilities) [ 4].	[]
MIBDs were used for linkage analyses.	[]
Transcript distributions were normalized using an inverse normalization transformation of z - scores of individual transcripts regressed on the mean individual transcript level.	[]
We further adjusted for the effects of age, age2, sex, age x sex and age2 x sex interaction using predictive linear regression models in SAS 9. 1 ( Cary, NC).	[]
We generated these residuals as part of our processing of the transcripts for linkage analyses.	[]
Heritability estimation and linkage analysis	[]
Heritability was estimated using maximum likelihood variance decomposition methods in SOLAR [ 5, 6].	[]
Genome scans were performed using multipoint variance - components models that test for linkage between traits and genetic variants by partitioning the variance of the expression level into its additive genetic and environmental variance components [ 7].	[]
For transcripts with co - localized QTLs, we performed bivariate linkage analysis to identify shared genetic effects.	[]
The bivariate polygenic model estimates correlations caused by residual additive genetic effects ( rho G) and correlations caused by random environmental effects ( rho E) [ 8].	[]
To test for additive genetic correlation among pairs of traits, the log likelihood of a model in which rho G is constrained to 0 ( null hypothesis, no correlation) or rho G = 1 ( null hypothesis, complete shared genetic effect) is compared to that of a model in which rho G is estimated for the traits.	[]
Significant differences among the models ( rho G! = 0) suggest that some of the same genes influence both traits.	[]
We also performed linkage analysis using the factors obtained from the PCA in a sample of transcripts with co - localized QTLs.	[]
Principal - component analysis	[]
PCA was used to reduce the number of expression profiles into statistically meaningful groups while retaining the original total variance using all the expression profiles [ 9, 10].	[]
We selected two different chromosomal regions of a length of 10 to 12 MB in which the QTLs of at least 10 transcripts were co - localized.	[]
Only transcripts of genes that were not located in these selected chromosomal regions were included in the analyses ( trans - regulatory genes).	[]
Because of the small number of individuals in the study and concerns of overfitting the model, a maximum sample of 50 transcript values were considered at one time [ 11].	[]
The number of factors was determined using the eigenvalue - one requirement [ 11].	[]
Factors are interpreted by examining the varimax - rotated factor loadings, which are the correlations between each phenotype and the factor in question.	[]
Factor loadings greater than or equal to 0. 40 in absolute value were used to interpret factors and to characterize the factor structures; this criterion ensures that the individual factor variables share at least 15% of their variance with the given factor [ 9].	[]
The principle components were obtained by calculating the eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix, which represent the amount of variance contributed by each factor.	[]
Only factors with eigenvalues higher than 1 were considered for linkage analysis.	[]
Integrating data from linkage analysis for gene co - expression	[]
Linkage signals of individual transcript expressions were recorded and the location of QTLs was compared to the location of the transcript gene in order to identify trans - regulatory sites.	[]
In addition, the location and LOD scores of QTLs identified in single individual transcript analysis ( univariate analysis) were compared with the location of the QTLs identified using bivariate analysis or factors of the PCA.	[]
This allowed a determination of whether the bivariate analysis or PCA data reduction analysis improved our evidence for linkage, and if so, a more in - depth examination of the transcripts included in the principal components needs to be examined for biologic interactions on complex disorders.	[]
Results	[]
Among 194 individuals from 14 families, 17 individuals with missing information on age were excluded.	[]
Seventy - six percent ( n = 2688) of the transcripts had significant heritability ( p < 0. 05) and were considered for the linkage analysis.	[]
Of this, 1448 ( 54%) transcripts displayed suggestive evidence of linkage ( had a maximum LOD score > = 1. 8 [ 12]).	[]
The QTLs of 1661 transcripts ( 759 of which with LOD > = 1. 8) were localized in a different region than the gene transcript ( trans - regulatory sites).	[]
We used two different chromosomal regions with co - localized transcript QTLs, chromosomes 4q28. 2 - q31. 1 and 13q34, for more in - depth analyses.	[]
Chromosome 4q28. 2 - q31. 1 region	[]
Table 1 reports the results for the chromosome 4q28. 2 - q31. 1 region.	[]
Fifteen transcripts co - localized in this region in the univariate linkage analysis, and the LOD scores ranged from 1. 17 to 3. 72.	[]
The strongest linkage signals were observed for the transcripts of the MX2, NUCB2, and SNX4 genes.	[]
Using PCA, we obtained five factors from the 15 transcripts with eigenvalues greater than 1.	[]
Only one factor, with a high positive loading for the MX2 gene transcript, had a significant heritability and a LOD score > = 1. 8.	[]
The linkage analysis using this factor identified the chromosome region for the MX2 gene, but the LOD score was lower than the one obtained by single linkage analysis of the MX2 transcript.	[]
We then performed bivariate analysis of all pairwise co - localized transcripts on 4q28. 2 - q31. 1 and found evidence for genetic correlation of co - localized genes, although without much increase in the magnitude of the LOD score ( Figure 1).	[]
This analysis identified two networks of gene expressions ( Figure 1).	[]
We obtained two factors using PCA of the first network ( Group 1, SNX4, YWHAQ, ASS, MX2, and ISGF3G gene transcripts).	[]
Both factors had significant heritability; however, only Factor 1, loading heavily on the MX2 gene, localized to the 4q28. 2 - q31. 1 region ( Table 1), and the magnitude of the LOD score was lower than that of the univariate MX2 gene transcript analysis ( LOD = 2. 28).	[]
The heritability of one factor obtained using PCA for Group 2 transcripts was not significant and further analysis was not performed.	[]
Chromosome 13q34 region	[]
We performed analysis in an additional chromosome region of co - localized transcripts, 13q34 region, and noted similar results.	[]
Using univariate analysis, 12 transcripts co - localized in this region; and bivariate analysis revealed an intricate network of correlated traits ( Table 2 and Figure 2).	[]
Using PCA, we obtained five factors, three of them with significant heritability.	[]
Similar to our previous findings on chomosome 4, PCA factors did not improve the magnitude of the LOD scores when compared to univariate analysis.	[]
Discussion	[]
In this study, we identified co - localized QTLs of individual transcripts and compared the univariate and bivariate linkage results using single transcripts to those using factors obtained from PCA.	[]
By using factors that accounted for the variance of multiple transcripts with co - localized QTLs, we attempted to reduce the number of linkage analyses performed as well as possibly identifying previously unknown patterns of associated gene expression profiles.	[]
The PCA did in fact reduce the number of linkage analyses performed, but it did not improve the magnitude of signals in the target QTLs as compared with univariate or bivariate analyses.	[]
In fact, in at least one case, PCA was unable to detect a linkage signal for the main gene transcript loading in the factor ( Table 1, Group 1, Factor 2).	[]
We also performed pairwise bivariate genetic analysis on those transcripts that co - localized to the same genomic region, presumably because this area of the genome harbored genes involved in the regulation of these transcripts [ 2].	[]
We detected significant genetic correlation of these co - localized transcripts, indicating potential gene networks operating in these regions.	[]
However, in most cases, bivariate linkage analysis did not improve the magnitude of the LOD score compared to univariate analysis.	[]
Most traits were highly correlated ( rho G > 0. 60), and therefore they may provide redundant information that may reduce the power for detection of the bivariate signal [ 8].	[]
In addition, because rho G is a test of the overall additive genetic correlation among two traits and not the QTL - specific pleiotropy, it is possible that the co - localized linkage signals are not in fact genetically correlated.	[]
Further analysis is required to address these issues.	[]
The chromosome regions selected for detailed analyses were arbitrarily chosen as we identified multiple other regions with co - localized linkage of gene expressions.	[]
The results from our univariate genome scan differ markedly from those reported by Morley et al.	[]
[ 2] because we included a smaller sample of individuals so that adjustment for covariate effects of age could be made.	[]
Our analysis strategy also adjusted for the effects of age and sex, which could also add to the observed differences [ 13].	[]
Finally, our definition of genome window size for co - localized gene expressions was twice larger than the one described in the study of Morley et al.	[]
Conclusion	[]
We identified several chromosomal regions of co - localized trans - regulatory genes with significant heritability.	[]
Some of these regulatory genes displayed strong additive genetic correlations, and may be part of genetic networks.	[]
However, when compared to univariate analysis, linkage analysis of bivariate phenotypes and factor scores obtained from PCA did not improve the ability to identify chromosomal regions of co - localized gene expressions.	[]

Potentiation of Nerve Growth Factor - Induced Neurite Outgrowth by Fluvoxamine: Role of Sigma - 1 Receptors, IP3 Receptors and Cellular Signaling Pathways	[]
Abstract	[]
Background	[]
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs) have been widely used and are a major therapeutic advance in psychopharmacology.	[]
However, their pharmacology is quite heterogeneous.	[]
The SSRI fluvoxamine, with sigma - 1 receptor agonism, is shown to potentiate nerve - growth factor ( NGF) - induced neurite outgrowth in PC 12 cells.	[]
However, the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying potentiation by fluvoxamine are not fully understood.	[]
In this study, we examined the roles of cellular signaling pathways in the potentiation of NGF - induced neurite outgrowth by fluvoxamine and sigma - 1 receptor agonists.	[]
Methods and Findings	[]
The effects of three SSRIs ( fluvoxamine, sertraline, paroxetine) and three sigma - 1 receptor agonists ( SA4503, 4 - phenyl - 1 - ( 4 - phenylbutyl) piperidine ( PPBP), and dehydroepiandrostero ( DHEA) - sulfate) on NGF - induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells were examined.	[]
Also examined were the effects of the sigma - 1 receptor antagonist NE - 100, inositol 1, 4, 5 - triphosphate ( IP3) receptor antagonist, and specific inhibitors of signaling pathways in the potentiation of NGF - induced neurite outgrowth by selective sigma - 1 receptor agonist SA4503.	[]
Fluvoxamine ( but not sertraline or paroxetine) and the sigma - 1 receptor agonists SA4503, PPBP, and DHEA - sulfate significantly potentiated NGF - induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells in a concentration - dependent manner.	[]
The potentiation by fluvoxamine and the three sigma - 1 receptor agonists was blocked by co - administration of the selective sigma - 1 receptor antagonist NE - 100, suggesting that sigma - 1 receptors play a role in blocking the enhancement of NGF - induced neurite outgrowth.	[]
Moreover, the potentiation by SA4503 was blocked by co - administration of the IP3 receptor antagonist xestospongin C.	[]
In addition, the specific inhibitors of phospholipase C ( PLC - gamma), phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K), p38MAPK, c - Jun N - terminal kinase ( JNK), and the Ras / Raf / mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK) signaling pathways blocked the potentiation of NGF - induced neurite outgrowth by SA4503.	[]
Conclusion	[]
These findings suggest that stimulation of sigma - 1 receptors and subsequent interaction with IP3 receptors, PLC - gamma, PI3K, p38MAPK, JNK, and the Ras / Raf / MAPK signaling pathways are involved in the mechanisms of action of sigma - 1 receptor agonists such as fluvoxamine and SA4503.	[]
Introduction	[]
Selective serotonin ( 5 - HT; 5 - hydroxytryptamine) reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs) have emerged as a major therapeutic advance in psychopharmacology.	[]
SSRIs are the treatment of choice for many indications, including major depressive disorder, dysthymia, panic disorder, obsessive - compulsive disorder, eating disorders, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder.	[]
In contrast, it is well known that their pharmacology is quite heterogeneous, although all of them block 5 - HT transporters, thus increasing 5 - HT levels throughout the central nervous system ( CNS) [ 1] - [ 9].	[]
Accumulating evidence suggests that sigma - 1 receptors, which are intracellular endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) proteins, are involved in both the neuroplasticity and pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric diseases such as major depressive disorder, anxiety, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer ' s disease [ 10] - [ 18].	[]
Previously, we reported that some SSRIs possess high to moderate affinities for sigma - 1 receptors in the rat brain.	"rat	60	63	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""rat"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The rank order of SSRIs affinities for sigma - 1 receptors is fluvoxamine ( Ki = 36 nM) > sertraline ( Ki = 57 nM) > > paroxetine ( Ki = 1893 nM) [ 19].	[]
Recently, we reported that fluvoxamine, but not paroxetine, significantly ameliorated cognitive deficits in mice after repeated phencyclidine administration, and that the effects of fluvoxamine were antagonized by co - administration of the selective sigma - 1 receptor antagonist NE - 100 [ 20], suggesting that sigma - 1 receptors are involved in the mechanism of action of fluvoxamine [ 9].	"mice	108	112	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that sigma - 1 receptor agonists including fluvoxamine could potentiate nerve growth factor ( NGF) - induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells, and that NE - 100 blocked the potentiation by sigma - 1 receptor agonists, suggesting sigma - 1 receptors are involved in neuroplasticity [ 21].	[]
However, the precise cellular mechanisms underlying the potentiation by sigma - 1 receptor agonists are not fully understood [ 13], [ 21].	[]
It is therefore of great interest to study the precise cellular mechanisms underlying the enhancement by fluvoxamine on NGF - induced neurite sprouting in PC12 cells.	[]
In the present study, we examined the effects of three SSRIs ( fluvoxamine, sertraline, paroxetine), as well as the effects of a sigma - 1 receptor agonist ( 4 - phenyl - 1 - ( 4 - phenylbutyl) piperidine ( PPBP), dehydroepiandrostero - sulphate ( DHEA) - sulfate) [ 9], [ 22] - [ 28] and the selective sigma - 1 receptor agonist SA4503 [ 29], [ 30], on NGF - induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells.	[]
Furthermore, it is also known that sigma - 1 receptors have been shown to interact with IP3 receptors ( 17, 18).	[]
Therefore, we examined the effects of NE - 100 and xestospongin C ( a selective inositol 1, 4, 5 - triphosphate ( IP3) receptor antagonist) [ 31] in order to investigate the roles of sigma - 1 receptors and IP3 receptors in the mechanisms underlying the enhancement of NGF - induced neurite outgrowth by SA4503.	[]
Moreover, we examined the effects of specific inhibitors of several cellular signaling targets on the enhancement of NGF - induced neurite outgrowth by SA4503, since several signal transduction molecules have been implicated in NGF - induced neurite outgrowth [ 32].	[]

The selective sigma - 1 receptor antagonists NE - 100 and 4 - phenyl - 1 - ( 4 - phenylbutyl) piperidine ( PPBP) were synthesized in our laboratory.	[]
Other drugs were purchased from commercial sources.	[]
Cell culture	[]
PC12 sells ( RIKEN Cell Bank, Tsukuba, Japan) were cultured at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 with Dulbecco ' s modified Eagle ' s medium ( DMEM) supplemented with 5% heat - inactivated fetal bovine serum ( FBS), 10% heat - inactivated horse serum, and 1% penicillin.	"bovine	182	188	Organism/Species"	"horse	226	231	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bovine"", ""start_span"": 182, ""end_span"": 188, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""horse"", ""start_span"": 226, ""end_span"": 231, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The medium was changed two or three times a week.	[]
PC12 cells were plated onto 24 - well tissue culture plates coated with poly - D - lysine / laminin.	[]
Cells were plated at relatively low density ( 0. 25 x 104 cells / cm2) in DMEM medium containing 0. 5% FBS, 1% penicillin streptomycin.	[]
Medium containing a minimal level of serum ( 0. 5% FBS) was used, since serum is known to contain steroid hormones that bind to sigma - 1 receptors [ 21].	[]
First, we examined the optimal concentration of NGF for NGF - induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells.	[]
NGF ( 2. 5, 5, 10, 20, 40 ng / ml) increased the number of cells with neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells in a concentration - dependent manner ( Figure 1).	[]
In the subsequent studies, 2. 5 ng / ml of NGF was used to study the potentiating effects of sigma - 1 receptor agonists on NGF - induced neurite outgrowth.	[]
Twenty - four hours after plating, the medium was replaced with DMEM medium containing 0. 5% FBS and 1% penicillin streptomycin with NGF ( 2. 5 ng / ml) with or without several drugs.	[]
Quantification of neurite sprouting	[]
Five days after incubation with NGF ( 2. 5 ng / ml) with or without the several drugs, morphometric analysis was performed on digitized images of live cells taken under phase - contrast illumination with an inverted microscope linked to a camera.	[]
Images of three fields per well were taken, with an average of 100 cells per field.	[]
Differentiated cells were counted by visual examination of the field; only cells that had at least one neurite with a length equal to the cell body diameter were counted, and were then expressed as a percentage of the total cells in the field.	[]
The counting was performed in a blinded manner.	[]
Immunocytochemistry	[]
Cells were fixed for 30 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde then permeabilized with 0. 2% Triton and blocked with 1. 5% normal goat serum, 0. 1% bovine serum albumin ( BSA) in 0. 1 M phosphate - buffer saline for 1 h to reduce nonspecific binding.

Cells were incubated overnight at 4 degrees C with anti - microtubule - associated protein 2 ( MAP - 2) antibodies ( 1: 1000 dilution in blocking solution, Chemicon International, Temecula, CA, USA).	[]
The immunolabeling was visualized with secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa - 488 ( 1: 1000; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).	[]
MAP - 2 immuncytochemistry was visualized with a fluorescence microscope ( Axiovert 200, Carl Zeiss, Oberkocken, Germany).	[]
Statistical analysis	[]
Data are expressed as means + / - S. E. M.	[]
Statistical analysis was performed by using one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA) and the post hoc Bonferroni / Dunn test.	[]
P values less than 0. 05 were considered statistically significant.	[]
Results	[]
Effects of SSRIs on NGF - induced neurite outgrowth	[]
Fluvoxamine ( 0. 1, 1. 0, or 10 micro M) significantly increased the number of cells with neurite outgrowth by NGF ( 2. 5 ng / ml) in PC12 cells, in a concentration - dependent manner ( Figure 2 and 4).	[]
In contrast, sertraline ( 0. 1, 1. 0, or 10 micro M) and paroxetine ( 0. 1, 1. 0, or 10 micro M) did not increase the number of cells with neurite outgrowth by NGF ( 2. 5 ng / ml).	[]
A higher concentration ( 10 micro M) of paroxetine and sertraline significantly decreased the number of cells with NGF - induced neurite outgrowth, suggesting the cellular toxicity of these drugs in PC12 cells ( Figure 2).	[]
Role of sigma - 1 receptors in the potentiation of NGF - induced neurite outgrowth by fluvoxamine and SA4503	[]
The selective and potent sigma - 1 receptor agonist SA4503 ( 0. 01, 0. 1, or 1. 0 micro M) significantly increased the number of cells with neurite outgrowth by NGF ( 2. 5 ng / ml) in PC12 cells, in a concentration - dependent manner ( Figure 3 and 4).	[]
In addition, other sigma - 1 receptor agonists - PPBP ( 0. 1, 1. 0, or 10 micro M) [ 22] - [ 26] and DHEA - sulphate ( 0. 1, 1. 0, or 10 micro M) [ 9], [ 27], [ 28] - significantly increased the number of such cells, also in a concentration - dependent manner ( Figure 3).	[]
In the absence of NGF, sigma - 1 receptor agonists did not produce neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells ( data not shown).	[]
To investigate the role of sigma - 1 receptors, we examined the effects of NE - 100 ( a selective sigma - 1 receptor antagonist) on the potentiation of NGF - induced neurite outgrowth by fluvoxamine, SA4503, PPBP, and DHEA - sulphate.	[]
Co - administration of NE - 100 ( 1. 0 micro M) significantly blocked such potentiation by fluvoxamine ( 10 micro M), SA4503 ( 1. 0 micro M), PPBP ( 10 micro M), or DHEA - sulphate ( 10 micro M) ( Figure 2 and 3).	[]
Furthermore, administration of NE - 100 ( 1. 0 micro M) alone did not alter NGF - induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells ( Figure 2).	[]
Role of IP3 receptors in the potentiation of NGF - induced neurite outgrowth by SA4503	[]
Sigma - 1 receptors have been shown to interact with IP3 receptors ( 17, 18, 33 - 35).	[]
To investigate the role of IP3 receptors in the effects of SA4503 on NGF - induced neurite outgrowth, we examined the effects of xestospongin C ( a selective, reversible, and membrane - permeable inhibitor of IP3 receptors) [ 31] on the effects of SA4503 on NGF - induced neurite outgrowth.	[]
Co - administration of xestospongin C ( 1. 0 micro M) significantly blocked the potentiation of NGF - induced neurite outgrowth by SA4503 ( 1. 0 micro M) ( Figure 5).	[]
Furthermore, administration of xestospongin C ( 1. 0 micro M) alone did not alter NGF - induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells ( Figure 5).	[]
Role of signaling molecules proximal to TrkA in the potentiation of NGF - induced neurite outgrowth by SA4503	[]
Next, we examined the effects of the specific inhibitors of PLC - gamma, PI3K, p38 MAPK, and c - Jun N - terminal kinase ( JNK), since these signaling molecules are activated upon the addition of NGF [ 36].	[]
The PLC - gamma inhibitor ( U73122; 1. 0 micro M), PI3K inhibitor ( LY294002; 1. 0 micro M), p38 MAPK inhibitor ( SB203580; 1. 0 micro M), and JNK inhibitor ( SP600125; 1. 0 micro M) significantly blocked the potentiation of NGF - induced neurite outgrowth by SA4503 ( 1. 0 micro M) ( Figure 6).	[]
In contrast, these inhibitors alone did not alter NGF - induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells ( Figure 6).	[]
Role of Raf / Ras / ERK / MAPK pathway in the potentiation of NGF - induced neurite outgrowth by SA4503	[]
The Raf / Ras / ERK / MAPK pathway is known to be involved in NGF - induced outgrowth [ 32].	[]
Therefore, we examined the effects of this pathway ' s specific inhibitors.	[]
The Ras inhibitor ( GW5074; 1. 0 micro M), Raf inhibitor ( lovastatin; 1. 0 micro M), MEK1 / 2 inhibitor ( SL327; 1. 0 micro M), and MAPK inhibitor ( PD98059; 1. 0 micro M) significantly blocked the potentiation of NGF - induced neurite outgrowth by SA4503 ( 1. 0 micro M) ( Figure 7).	[]
In contrast, these inhibitors alone did not alter NGF - induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells ( Figure 7).	[]
Discussion	[]
In the present study, we found that fluvoxamine ( but not sertraline or paroxetine) and the sigma - 1 receptor agonists ( SA4503, PPBP, DHEA - sulfate) could potentiate NGF - induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells, and that the effects of these drugs were blocked by co - incubation with the selective sigma - 1 receptor antagonist NE - 100.	[]
These findings suggest that agonism at sigma - 1 receptors for these drugs is involved in the mechanisms underlying the drugs ' potentiation of NGF - induced neurite outgrowth.	[]
As shown in Figure 1, NGF increased the number of cells with neurite outgrowth in PC12, in a concentration dependent manner.	[]
To examine whether or not the NGF levels are altered by incubation with sigma - 1 receptor agonists, we measured the levels of NGF in PC12 cells with or without sigma - 1 receptor agonist SA4503.	[]
No differences of NGF levels were shown in the between control group and SA4503 - treated group ( data not shown).	[]
It is, therefore, unlikely that the potentaition of NGF - induced neurite outgrowth by sigma - 1 receptor agonists might be due to increased levels of NGF.	[]
Unlike fluvoxamine, sertraline, which has a moderate affinity for sigma - 1 receptors, did not alter NGF - induced neurite outgrowth.	[]
The reasons underlying this discrepancy between these two SSRIs are currently unclear.	[]
One possibility may involve the difference in pharmacological actions ( agonist vs. antagonist) between these SSRIs at sigma - 1 receptors.	[]
Interestingly, we recently found that, in a novel object recognition test, phencyclidine - induced cognitive deficits could be significantly improved by subsequent subchronic ( 14 days) administration of fluvoxamine, but not of sertraline, suggesting that sigma - 1 receptor agonism is involved in fluvoxamine ' s mechanism of action [ 9], Ishima et al., submitted.	[]
Taken together, these findings suggest that fluvoxamine and sertraline may function as an agonist and an antagonist at sigma - 1 receptors, respectively, although further study is necessary.	[]
Another possibility may be that other pharmacological activities of sertraline mask the effects of sigma - 1 receptor agonism.	[]
In this study, we also found that high concentration ( 10 micro M) of paroxetine and sertraline, but not fluvoxamine, showed cytotoxicity in PC12 cells, suggesting that fluvoxamine may be a safe drug than paroxetine and sertraline.	[]
Sigma - 1 receptors have been shown to affect intracellular Ca2 + signaling, although the precise molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying this effect are unknown.	[]
Sigma - 1 receptors bind to IP3 receptors in ER, and sigma - 1 receptors regulate Ca2 + release from intracellular Ca2 + storage sites [ 12].	[]
Very recently, Hayashi and Su [ 17] reported that sigma - 1 receptors function as novel ligand - operated chaperones that specifically target mitochondrion - associated ER membrane.	[]
Furthermore, sigma - 1 receptors form Ca2 + - sensitive chaperone machinery with another chaperone, BiP, and prolong Ca2 + signaling from ER into mitochondria by stabilizing IP3 receptors at mitochondrion - associated ER membrane [ 17].	[]
In this study, we found that the IP3 receptor antagonist xestospongin C significantly blocked the potentiation of NGF - induced neurite outgrowth by SA4503, suggesting the role of IP3 receptors on sigma - 1 receptor - mediated potentiation of NGF - induced neurite outgrowth.	[]
Therefore, it is likely that stimulation at sigma - 1 receptors by sigma - 1 receptor agonists and subsequent interaction with IP3 receptors are involved in the mechanism underlying the potentiation of NGF - induced neurite outgrowth by sigma - 1 receptor agonists.	[]
NGF binds to the high - affinity tyrosine receptor TrkA, initiating several signaling pathways affecting both morphological and transcriptional targets [ 32], [ 36], [ 37].	[]
The signaling molecules, including PLC - gamma, PI3K, p38 MAPK, and JNK, are activated upon the addition of NGF [ 38].	[]
PLC - gamma catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol - 4, 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP2) to diacylglycerol ( DAG) and inositol triphosphate ( IP3).	[]
DAG activates protein kinase C, and IP3 promotes transient release of Ca2 + from the ER [ 39].	[]
The pathway via PLC - gamma is responsible for NGF - induced cell differentiation [ 40] and neurite outgrowth [ 41].	[]
Furthermore, stimulation of PI3K is reported to be involved in the promotion of neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells [ 42].	[]
In this study, we found that the PLC - gamma inhibitor U73122 and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 significantly blocked the potentiation of NGF - induced neurite outgrowth by SA4503.	[]
Moreover, we found that both the p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 and the JNK inhibitor SP600125 significantly blocked the potentiation of NGF - induced neurite outgrowth by SA4503.	[]
In addition, it is also interesting that neurite outgrowth induced by low concentration ( 2. 5 ng / ml) of NGF was not blocked by these inihibitors, consistent with a previous report [ 43], [ 44], suggesting the existence of novel pathway ( s) for NGF - induced neurite outgrowth.	[]
These findings suggest that the PLC - gamma, PI3K, p38MAPK, and JNK signaling pathways are involved in the potentiation of NGF - induced neurite outgrowth by sigma - 1 receptor agonists ( Figure 8).	[]
In addition, we found that the specific inhibitors for the Raf / Ras / MEK / MAPK pathways significantly blocked the potentiation of NGF - induced neurite outgrowth by SA4503, suggesting that these pathways are involved in the potentiation of NGF - induced neurite outgrowth by sigma - 1 receptor agonists ( Figure 8).	[]
Our recent positron emission tomography ( PET) study demonstrated that, after a single oral administration, fluvoxamine bound to sigma - 1 receptors in the living human brain [ 45].	"human	163	168	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 163, ""end_span"": 168, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This finding suggests that sigma - 1 receptors are involved in the mechanism of action of fluvoxamine in the human brain [ 45].	"human	109	114	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Taken together, the past and present findings suggest that, unlike paroxetine and sertraline, the SSRI fluvoxamine, with its sigma - 1 receptor agonistic activity, might be a unique therapeutic drug for neuropsychiatric diseases.	[]
In conclusion, the present results suggest that, as a sigma - 1 receptor agonist, fluvoxamine could potentiate the NGF - induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells.	[]
Furthermore, it is likely that interaction with IP3 receptors and several subsequent signaling molecules are involved in the mechanism underlying the pharmacological action of sigma - 1 receptor agonists.	[]
Therefore, it is likely that sigma - 1 receptor agonists such as fluvoxamine and DHEA - sulfate, which are available around the world, would be unique therapeutic drugs for neuropsychiatric diseases.	[]
A novel, non - invasive, online - monitoring, versatile and easy plant - based probe for measuring leaf water status	[]
Abstract	[]
A high - precision pressure probe is described which allows non - invasive online - monitoring of the water relations of intact leaves.	[]
Real - time recording of the leaf water status occurred by data transfer to an Internet server.	[]
The leaf patch clamp pressure probe measures the attenuated pressure, Pp, of a leaf patch in response to a constant clamp pressure, Pclamp.	[]
Pp is sensed by a miniaturized silicone pressure sensor integrated into the device.	[]
The magnitude of Pp is dictated by the transfer function of the leaf, Tf, which is a function of leaf patch volume and ultimately of cell turgor pressure, Pc, as shown theoretically.	[]
The power function Tf = f ( Pc) theoretically derived was experimentally confirmed by concomitant Pp and Pc measurements on intact leaflets of the liana Tetrastigma voinierianum under greenhouse conditions.	"Tetrastigma voinierianum	153	177	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Tetrastigma voinierianum"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 177, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Simultaneous Pp recordings on leaflets up to 10 m height above ground demonstrated that changes in Tf induced by Pc changes due to changes of microclimate and / or of the irrigation regime were sensitively reflected in corresponding changes of Pp.	[]
Analysis of the data show that transpirational water loss during the morning hours was associated with a transient rise in turgor pressure gradients within the leaflets.	[]
Subsequent recovery of turgescence during the afternoon was much faster than the preceding transpiration - induced water loss if the plants were well irrigated.	[]
Our data show the enormous potential of the leaf patch clamp pressure probe for leaf water studies including unravelling of the hydraulic communication between neighbouring leaves and over long distances within tall plants ( trees).	[]
Introduction	[]
Optimum water supply, particularly at peak needs of the plants, is an important issue for greenhouse and field vegetable production.	[]
In a greenhouse on a sunny day, evaporation and transpiration ( so - called evapotranspiration) can occur so rapidly that water loss can cause plant damage before wilting symptoms are visible.	[]
Even at lower temperatures the restricted rooting in greenhouses leads frequently to plant water deficiency.	[]
Thus, no matter how slight, drought stress will result in a significant reduction in growth and, in turn, of harvest yield.	[]
On the other hand, over - irrigation must be avoided and the appropriate method of watering must be selected because wet soils and permanent moisture on plant organs promote the incidence of root mould, grey mould ( Botrytis blight), formation of leaf oedema, and other plant diseases ( Sherf and MacNab, 1986).	[]
Conservation of water is another important issue in semi - arid and arid regions where water is scarce.	[]
The advent of ( subsurface) drip irrigation has considerably reduced water consumption of agricultural, horticultural, and greenhouse crops, but has also highlighted the need for sensors monitoring water deficiency of plants directly and online ( Jones, 2004).	[]
In plant physiology and agriculture the pressure bomb technique pioneered by Scholander et al.	[]
( 1965) is a widely accepted reference technique for measuring leaf water status.	[]
However, the method is massively invasive, slow, labour - intensive ( and therefore expensive), unsuitable for automation, and gives only spot measurements.	[]
Furthermore, interpretation of the data is still a matter of debate ( Zimmermann U et al., 2004; Zimmermann D et al., 2007).	[]
Leaf thickness is also sometimes used as an indicator for water stress ( Burquez, 1987; McBurney, 1992; Malone, 1993).	[]
Leaf thickness monitoring devices are commercially available.	[]
They are non - invasive and suitable for online measurements, but have the disadvantage that changes in water status are frequently not reflected sensitively in changes of leaf thickness.	[]
The pressure probe technique pioneered by Zimmermann, Tomos, and others ( Zimmermann et al., 1969, 2004; Tomos, 1988; Balling and Zimmermann, 1990), on the other hand, is a well established technology for measuring turgor and xylem pressure on the levels of individual cells and xylem vessels, respectively.	[]
This technique is not suitable for automation.	[]
Moreover, the probe technique requires rather sophisticated equipment and a high level of technical skill.	[]
These disadvantages are also shared by the ball tonometry, a method which allows non - invasive monitoring of cell turgor pressure by application of an external pressure ( Lintilhac et al., 2000; Geitmann, 2006).	[]
Other water stress monitoring devices are described in the literature, but all of them have various disadvantages which prevented their implementation for leaf water status measurements in greenhouses or in the field ( see, for example, the review article of Jones, 2004, and also Grant et al., 2007).	[]
In this communication a novel, non - invasive, online - monitoring plant - based probe is described that meets the demands of controlling horticultural and agricultural water applications.	[]
The probe is characterized by high precision, operating convenience, minimum costs, and by automation suitability.	[]
Data can be transferred wireless to a personal computer or to an Internet server via a mobile phone network for real - time evaluation and for the automatic regulation of irrigation.	[]
The technology includes a miniaturized silicone pressure sensor integrated into a spring clamp that is clamped to a patch of an intact plant leaf.	[]
The patch clamp pressure probe measures the attenuated pressure response of the leaf patch upon the application of a constant, clamped pressure.	[]
The attenuation of the applied pressure depends on the transfer function of the leaf.	[]
The magnitude of the transfer function depends on two terms, a turgor pressure - independent term ( related to the compression of the cuticle, cell walls, and other structural elements) and a turgor pressure - dependent term.	[]
Theory shows that the turgor pressure - dependent part of the transfer function Tf is a power function of the cell turgor pressure, Pc, and predicts that Tf assumes values close to zero if Pc is high and, vice versa, values close to unity if Pc is low.	[]
This could be verified by combined turgor pressure probe and leaf patch clamp pressure probe measurements on leaflets of the liana Tetrastigma voinierianum.	"Tetrastigma voinierianum	131	155	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Tetrastigma voinierianum"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 155, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The 10 - m tall liana growing in a tropical greenhouse was selected for the first studies because a comprehensive data set about diurnal changes in xylem and turgor pressure gradients under various environmental conditions existed for this greenhouse plant ( Benkert et al., 1995; Th u rmer et al., 1999; see also Zimmermann et al., 2004).	[]
Measurements of diurnal changes of the patch clamp pressure performed here yielded results which were consistent with the previous pressure probe work on the liana.	[]
The data also demonstrated that changes in the irrigation regime and in microclimate can be sensed by this novel probe very sensitively and that use of several probes allowed the study of the diurnal water transport at multiple scales from single leaves to the whole organism ( Meinzer et al., 2001).	[]
This can be done without knowledge of the turgor pressure because the transfer function is a direct measure of leaf water status.	[]
Materials and methods	[]
Plant material	[]
Experiments were performed on two specimens of the liana Tetrastigma voinierianum, growing in the c.	"Tetrastigma voinierianum	57	81	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Tetrastigma voinierianum"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
12 m tall tropical greenhouse of the University of Salzburg, Austria.	[]
The ground ascended by about 5 m towards the backstage of the greenhouse.	[]
The height of the plant in this area was about 4. 5 m, whereas the height of the plant in the front area reached 10 m.	[]
However, the stem and the branches of the two plants were considerably longer, because the plants had grown vertically upwards and then part of the way downwards.	[]
First measurements were performed during the last week of May, 2007.	[]
This week was very sunny and warm.	[]
Experiments were repeated during the last week of August and the first week of September, 2007.	[]
At this time of the year the weather conditions were quite poor.	[]
The weeks were rainy, sunshine occurred only occasionally.	[]
On average, the sky was very cloudy.	[]
Due to the variable weather conditions the ambient temperature, T, in the greenhouse usually varied between 19 degrees C and 27 degrees C.	[]
By contrast, during the hot week in May temperatures at the top of the plants could reach up to 44 degrees C.	[]
The greenhouse was illuminated between 07. 30 h and 19. 00 h ( CET = Central European Time).	[]
During the day - time, the artificial illumination was switched off automatically once the natural irradiance exceeded about 45 mu mol photons m - 2 s - 1 at ground level.	[]
At full sunshine, the light intensity was limited by automatically operating blinds.	[]
The relative humidity ( r. h.) of the air was regulated by overhead misters.	[]
Despite attempts to keep the r. h. above 60 - 70% large axial r. h. gradients along the stem of the liana were observed during sunny days ( see below).	[]
The ambient temperature and relative humidity at the measuring sites were determined by using thermistors ( Tinytag; RS Components GmbH, M o rfelden - Walldorf, Germany).	[]
Leaf patch clamp pressure probe and data acquisition	[]
The pressure sensor chip allows pressure measurements up to 100 kPa.	[]
The sensor consists of a miniature piezoresistive Wheatstone bridge.	[]
The sensors used in this work were purchased from the company ' Raumedic ' ( Helmbrechts, Germany) and from the company ' Keller ' ( AG, Druckmesstechnik; Winterthur, Switzerland).	[]
However, it has to be pointed out that any other miniaturized pressure or force sensor could be used.	[]
The sensor chip was integrated into one of the planar circular pads of a spring clamp shown schematically in Fig.	[]
1.	[]
The spring clamp consisted of two curved arms bridged by a spring in the middle ( Wolfcraft GmbH; microfix S ( B3630Fz60), Kempenich, Germany).	[]
The clamp pressure exerted by the spring on the leaf, Pclamp, could be varied by a stiff strap ( made of synthetic material) spanned between the arms of the spring clip at the handhold site ( Fig. 1).	[]
The length of the strap and thus the spring load acting on the leaflet between the two pads could be varied by regularly punched holes ( as in a belt).	[]
Calibration of the sensor chips was performed by pressurization in a pressure chamber equipped with an integrated manometer ( LEO 1, Keller AG, Winterthur, Switzerland).	[]
The readings of all sensors used in this study increased linearly with pressure in the range between 0 kPa and 100 kPa.	[]
The pressure sensitivity of the various sensors was found to be almost identical for all probes.	[]
Before use the probes were also tested for temperature - sensitivity in an accessible climate chamber because it is well - known that silicone - embedded sensors tend to become temperature - sensitive during storage.	[]
Probes were subject to temperature regimes ranging from 10 degrees C to 35 degrees C.	[]
Probes were not used if the temperature treatment induced a pressure change larger than 0. 5 kPa.	[]
The signals of the leaf patch clamp pressure probe were transmitted by a telemetry system ( teleBITcom gmbh, Teltow, Germany).	[]
The operating distance between the battery - powered wireless telemetric transmitter and the receiver base station was up to 400 m.	[]
Each transmitter read, amplified, and converted the analogue signals of the pressure sensor into digitalized signals.	[]
The data were sent together with the transmitter ID - code every 90 s via the ISM band of 433 MHz to the receiver base station which logged and transferred the data to a personal computer or to a GPRS modem linked to an Internet server ( NTBB Systemtechnik GmbH, Zeuthen, Germany) for analysis and archival storage.	[]
For sensor calibration and data recording the SENBIT software ( teleBITcom gmbh, Teltow, Germany) was used.	[]
The software allowed communication with up to 32 sensors at regular short intervals ( 90 s to 5 min).	[]
In this study, up to 10 sensor / transmitter units were installed at different heights on the two lianas.	[]
Data transfer to the Internet server operated without any problem during the entire experimental period.	[]
However, for safety reasons hard - wired conventional data acquisition was also performed using dataloggers ( Raumedic, Helmbrechts, Germany).	[]
The dataloggers were controlled by a computer program that provided functions for data storage and sensor calibration.	[]
Data were transferred regularly from the dataloggers to a personal computer.	[]
Cell turgor pressure probe	[]
Turgor pressure measurements were performed on leaflets of the 10 - m tall liana at c.	[]
0. 2 m height above the roots.	[]
The construction and function of the cell turgor pressure probe has been described elsewhere ( Zimmermann et al., 1969, 2004).	[]
Briefly, the microcapillary was filled with oil up to the very tip and was then inserted into the upper leaflet surface between the main vein and the leaflet edge.	[]
Insertion was made under a small overpressure ( about 20 kPa) achieved by appropriate displacement of the metal rod in the probe in order to avoid tip clogging.	[]
Penetration was stopped upon reaching the mesophyll cell layer and formation of a stable oil / sap meniscus within the tip region of the microcapillary of the probe.	[]
During the measurements it was regularly proved whether the tip was clogged or not by appropriate displacement of the metal rod.	[]
Theoretical background	[]
The input pressure, Pin, experienced by the cells in a leaf patch is equal to the clamp pressure, Pclamp, only if the pressure signal is transferred lossless to the cells in the leaves.	[]
However, losses usually occur due to the compressibility and the deformability of the silicone of the pressure sensor as well as of the compressibility of the cuticle and other structural elements of the leaf.	[]
Therefore, theory shows that only a fraction of Pclamp may arrive at the cells, i. e. that the attenuation factor, Fa = Pin / Pclamp, is smaller than unity.	[]
Fa depends on the individual leaf properties.	[]
Fa can be assumed to be constant ( and leaf thickness changes are negligible) if the structural elements are completely pre - compressed by application of an appropriate Pclamp.	[]
If Pclamp is kept constant during the following experimental period, Pin is constant and the output pressure, Pp, is only determined by the cell transfer function, Tf ( V), where V is the leaf patch volume.	[]
In other words, Tf ( V) determines the fraction of Pin sensed by the probe.	[]
It is dimensionless and assumes values between zero and unity: ( 1) Tf depends on the volume of the leaf patch, V, at constant ambient temperature, T: ( 2) delta V depends on changes in cell turgor pressure, delta Pc, as follows: ( 3) where op is the average volumetric elastic modulus of the clamped tissue ( Philip, 1958).

op is a very complex parameter and will be dictated by the turgor pressure in the turgescent state.	[]
For a first approximation it is assumed that op increases linearly with Pc ( support for this assumption is given by Zimmermann and Steudle, 1978; Zimmermann and H u sken, 1980; Wendler et al., 1983): ( 4) where a and b are constants for individual leaf properties.	[]
Because of the viscoelastic properties of the cell wall, the magnitude of the constants depends on the duration of the external pressure application ( Zimmermann and H u sken, 1980).	[]
The constants are relatively large if rapid turgor pressure changes are induced ( e. g. by using the cell turgor pressure probe), whereas slow turgor pressure changes ( e. g. under transpirational conditions) result in small values.	[]
Combining equations 2 - 4 leads to equation 5. ( 5)	[]
Equation 5 can be integrated by assuming for a first approximation that at Pc = 0 Tf = 1 and that the internal osmotic pressure of the cells remained constant.	[]
After appropriate re - arrangements equation 6 is obtained: ( 6) and, respectively, if the denominator is replaced by equation 4: ( 7)	[]
Introducing equation 6 into equation 1 yields the wanted relationship between the parameters Pp and Pin: ( 8)	[]
Equation 8 can be verified experimentally.	[]
Inspection of the equation shows that the patch clamp pressure, Pp, is a power function of the turgor pressure, Pc.	[]
The exponent of the function is equal to or smaller than unity.	[]
If a = 1 and b < < Pc, equation 8 turns into Pp = b / Pc, i. e. both parameters are directly reciprocally coupled with each other.	[]
Thus Tf assumes low values if Pc is high and, vice versa, a value close to unity if Pc is close to zero.	[]
Using appropriate values for a and b for a given leaf ( see below) it can be shown that below Pc = 100 kPa, Pp increases dramatically.	[]
This means that the transfer function responds very sensitively upon loss of complete turgor pressure.	[]
In the derivation of equation 8 it was assumed that op is temperature - independent.	[]
However, temperature effects on cell elasticity are well - known, although they are not very large in the temperature range investigated here ( see, for example, Petersen et al., 1982; Niklas, 1992; Hogan and Niklas, 2004; Edelmann et al., 2005).	[]
Temperature effects on op cannot be excluded if different values for the Pclamp, and, in turn, for the input pressure, Pin, are selected, as well as if significantly different values for the constants a and b are assumed for optimum fitting of the Pp = f ( Pc) curves.	[]
Therefore, in the case of large temperature gradients as observed here ( see Figs 2 and 3) only the relative, but not the absolute changes in Pp measured at the different heights can be compared with each other.	[]
However, Pp values measured at the same height are still comparable and give information about the turgescence, i. e. about the water status of the leaf cells.	[]
Results	[]
The leaf patch clamp pressure probe was clamped about 2 cm away from the edge of a leaflet of the compound leaves.	[]
Leaflets of similar size ( 176 + / - 58 cm2, n = 12) were used.	[]
Inspection of the leaf patches after removal of the probes under the microscope revealed no changes in leaflet appearance beneath the pads, even after several weeks.	[]
Lesions on the leaves were never found.	[]
Only occasionally were very slight impressions of the pads on the leaflet surface observed.	[]
Clamping of the leaves could be performed at any time of the day.	[]
Clamp pressures, Pclamp, applied to the leaves were of the order of 80 - 200 kPa.	[]
The optimum value for Pclamp of a given leaf has to be found empirically.	[]
Experience shows that Pclamp values could be considered as optimal if the output pressure Pp assumed values between 10 kPa and 25 kPa upon clamping in the early morning ( when turgor pressure was high) or between 50 kPa and 70 kPa upon clamping around noon or towards early afternoon ( when turgor pressure was usually low).	[]
The magnitude of Pp depended on the compressibility and deformability properties of the individual leaves which may vary considerably due to age, morphology, leaf thickness, abiotic factors etc.	[]
The magnitude of Pclamp had no effect on the diurnal profiles of Pp, in response to changes in microclimate and / or changes in the irrigation regime.	[]
Probes clamped on the same leaflet or nearby leaflets of leaves responded almost identically upon temporary changes in transpiration and / or water supply even if the Pclamp values were different due to different leaf thickness as well as local compressibility and deformability properties ( data not shown).	[]
This was found over the entire height of the plants.	[]
Screening experiments proved further that a high surface roughness prevented a uniform contact between the pads of the probe and the leaf.	[]
Non - uniform contact resulted in a reduced pressure response of the probe ( data not shown).	[]
Thus, in order to obtain maximum resolution of microclimate - induced and / or plant - based effects on the Pp values, it was crucial that the probe was placed on relatively smooth areas, i. e. preferentially between the veins rather than on the veins in order to guarantee a uniform pressure transmission.	[]
It also turned out that areas with lesions or covered with dust should be avoided.	[]
Probably due to the absence of dust, high resolution results were obtained when the sensor - containing pad faced the abaxial side, but not the adaxial side of the leaf.	[]
Diurnal changes in the patch clamp pressure	[]
Figure 2A represents Pp recordings conducted on the 10 m tall liana on 24 May and 25 May, 2007.	[]
The plant was well - watered before the beginning of the measurements ( 22 May) and was also watered regularly during the experimental period.	[]
The sufficient supply of the leaves with water was indicated by high turgor pressure values of c.	[]
500 kPa at predawn and guttation up to a height of 6 m around sunrise ( see also Th u rmer et al., 1999).	[]
Diurnal changes of the Pp values were recorded simultaneously at 0. 2 m, 6 m, and 10 m height.	[]
The corresponding diurnal changes in the ambient temperature, T, and relative humidity, r. h., measured close to the sites of the patch clamp pressure probes, are given in Fig.	[]
2B and C.	[]
It was very sunny on 24 May resulting in a rapid heating - up of the greenhouse, particularly in the upper part.	[]
This led to the development of large vertical gradients in T and r. h. along the stem of the liana ( Fig. 2B, C).	[]
Because sunlight was dimmed by operation of the automatic blinds at noon ( see Materials and methods) the gradients did not reach maximum values before the afternoon.	[]
Between 15. 30 h and 16. 30 h an ambient temperature of 44 degrees C and a relative humidity of 20% were recorded at the top of the liana, whereas at 0. 2 m height T and r. h. were 27 degrees C and 70%, respectively.	[]
The gradients in T and r. h. disappeared at c.	[]
22. 00 h.	[]
Due to the dense foliage of the plant above c.	[]
7 m and due to light dimming by the blinds, leaves closer to the ground only became exposed to direct sunshine towards the early afternoon.	[]
In contrast to 24 May, the following day was cloudy until noon.	[]
Thus, leaves in the upper part of the liana became fully exposed to bright sunshine first around 14. 00 h as indicated by the rapid increase in T and the corresponding decrease of r. h. above a height of 6 m ( Fig. 2B, C).	[]
Despite the strongly delayed exposure of the leaves to sunshine, comparable maximum values for T and r. h. at the three measuring sites, as well as vertical gradients in T and r. h. of comparable size, were measured between 15. 30 h and 16. 30 h as on the day before.	[]
Inspection of Fig.	[]
2 shows that the diurnal changes of T and r. h. at the three measuring sites are reflected in corresponding changes of Pp.	[]
During the nights the Pp values were low.	[]
After sunrise at 04. 24 h the Pp values remained low for further 4 - 5 h, except at 6 m height where a slight and continuous increase in the Pp values was very often recorded.	[]
After about 09. 00 h the Pp values increased over the entire height of the liana.	[]
Peaking of the Pp values occurred between 15. 30 h and 16. 30 h at all heights when the T and r. h. gradients reached maximum values.	[]
Towards the evening the Pp values decreased again in order to reach the original low values at c.	[]
22. 00 h.	[]
Until peaking in the afternoon, more or less pronounced fluctuations of the Pp values were seen.	[]
A part of these fluctuations seemed to be correlated with changes in the local ambient temperature, relative humidity and / or with a temporary exposure of the clamped leaflet to sunshine ( compare Fig. 2A with Fig. 2B, C).	[]
However, there was also a considerable number of fluctuations which could not be traced back to changes in the microclimate.	[]
An example can be found in Fig.	[]
2A ( arrow).	[]
The peaking of the Pp value measured at a height of 0. 2 m around 14. 00 h is obviously not induced by changes in the local temperature and relative humidity or by exposure to sunshine.	[]
Similar diurnal changes in Pp, T, and r. h. were also found for the 4. 5 m tall liana in the backstage of the greenhouse ( data not shown).	[]
Figure 3 shows long - term Pp, T, and r. h. measurements performed at 0. 2 m, 6 m, and 10 m height in late summer 2007.	[]
In contrast to the experimental conditions in late spring ( Fig. 2) the liana had been watered only sporadically during the weeks before the measurements.	[]
The soil was extremely dry and no guttation was observed at predawn, even at 0. 2 m height.	[]
Turgor pressure measurements performed at 0. 2 m height yielded values below 250 kPa at predawn.	[]
Continuous irrigation was started at 10. 00 h on 28 August ( c. 400 l d - 1).	[]
Guttation occurred at 0. 2 m height, but not at 6 m height on 1 September.	[]
At sunrise ( 05. 25 h), turgor pressures of c.	[]
500 kPa were recorded at the base of the liana.	[]
Guttation at 6 m height was still not observed on 3 September indicating that the hydration state of the plant was still less than in the last week of May.	[]
The T and r. h. profiles during the end of summer were also different to those in late spring ( compare Fig. 2B, C with Fig. 3B, C).	[]
On 28 August when irrigation started it was sunny.	[]
Similarly to May, peak values of T and r. h. were reached at c.	[]
15. 30 h.	[]
However, temperatures at the top of the plant did not exceed 35 degrees C and r. h. did not drop below 40%.	[]
Accordingly, the vertical T and r. h. gradients were smaller than those measured at the end of May.	[]
On 29 August, when it became very rainy and light irradiance dropped dramatically, gradients in T and r. h. of slightly decreased size were still recorded.	[]
Peaking of T and r. h. occurred at c.	[]
14. 30 h.	[]
T and r. h. gradients did not develop in the following three days which were very cloudy and rainy.	[]
An almost constant temperature of c.	[]
25 degrees C and a relative humidity of 80% were measured on the ground and at the top of the greenhouse throughout the day; light irradiance did not exceed 40 mu mol photons m - 2 s - 1.	[]
Only on 31 August, did the rain stop and the upper part of the liana was exposed to sunshine for 1 - 2 h and thus small T and r. h. gradients developed.	[]
The following days of 2 and 3 September were partly cloudy and sunny and the peaking of T and r. h. occurred at c.	[]
13. 00 h.	[]
The upper, but not the lower part of the liana was exposed to sunshine for several hours.	[]
This resulted in the formation of T and r. h. gradients.	[]
The size of the gradients was similar to that measured on 29 August.	[]
Inspection of Fig.	[]
3A indicates that peaking of the Pp values coincided with peaking of r. h. and T in Fig.	[]
3B and C.	[]
Figure 3A shows further that the peak amplitude of the Pp values recorded at the three measuring sites decreased continuously from 28 August whereas the low Pp values at the nights remained unaltered.	[]
The peak amplitude measured on 29 August was only slightly lower than that measured on the day before, the peak amplitude was rather low on 30 August.	[]
It remained at this low level until 2 September, except that on 31 August the peak amplitude at the three measuring sites increased slightly, presumably because of the short - time exposure of the upper leaves to sun ( see above).	[]
Comparison of the diurnal changes in the Pp values with the corresponding T and r. h. changes in Fig.	[]
3B and C indicates that part of the changes in the peak amplitude of the Pp values were induced by changes in the environmental parameters.	[]
However, part of the changes must obviously be attributed to irrigation.	[]
This conclusion can be drawn if, for example, the peaking of Pp on 2 and 3 September is compared with the peaking of Pp on 29 August.	[]
Despite the comparable size of the T and r. h. gradients, the peak Pp values were much smaller, particularly at 0. 2 m height, on 2 and 3 September compared with 29 August.	[]
Plots of the Pp values measured at 6 m and 10 m height on 24 May, 28 August, and 2 September against r. h.	[]
( or against T since both parameters were usually closely related) also support the view that the local microclimate is not the only factor which determined the magnitude of the Pp values at the three measuring sites.	[]
Figure 4 shows that the Pp values recorded at 6 m and 10 m height increased with decreasing r. h. from c.	[]
09. 00 h until r. h. reached the minimum value ( and T the maximum value, respectively), when with the progression of the day r. h. increased and T decreased, Pp decreased again.	[]
This decrease was much faster than expected in the light of the preceding r. h. - induced increase of Pp if the plant was well - watered ( 24 May; Fig. 4A, B).	[]
Refilling of the leaf cells was apparently enhanced by the high hydration state of the plant.	[]
By contrast, when the liana had not been irrigated well ( 28 August, Fig. 4C, D) both kinetics of the changes of Pp with r. h. were comparable.	[]
The low hydration state of the plant apparently delayed cell refilling.	[]
After 4 d irrigation ( 2 September), the low value of Pp recovered at relatively low r. h. as in May at 10 m height ( Fig. 4F), but not at 6 m height ( Fig. 4E).	[]
Recovery of the low Pp values at this height occurred, however, at significantly lower r. h. than on 28 August, indicating that rehydration of the leaves at this height had not been completed.	[]
Evaluation of other data sets yielded similar results ( not shown).	[]
Patch clamp pressure versus cell turgor pressure measurements	[]
The leaf patch clamp pressure probe measures the pressure transfer function of a defined leaflet area.	[]
The above theoretical considerations have shown that the transfer function is mainly determined by turgor pressure provided that the structural elements do not contribute or constantly contribute to the pressure signal transfer.	[]
In order to prove the theory parallel measurements of leaf patch clamp pressure ( Pp) and cell turgor pressure ( Pc) were performed on a leaflet at 0. 2 m height ( Fig. 5A).	[]
Simultaneously, the Pp values were recorded at 6 m and 10 m height ( Fig. 5B, C).	[]
Measurements were performed after several days of irrigation.	[]
In these experiments, the microcapillary of the turgor pressure probe was inserted into parenchymal cells located close to the main vein on the abaxial side of a leaflet, i. e. c.	[]
10 cm away from the leaf patch clamp pressure probe near the leaflet periphery.	[]
Turgor pressure measurements on leaf cells of T. voinierianum were difficult to perform because of the presence of mucilage.	[]
Mucilage resulted in clogging of the tip of the microcapillary of the cell turgor pressure probe.	[]
For this reason, measurements with the Scholander pressure chamber were not very reliable.	[]
It was extremely difficult to determine exactly the balancing pressure at which water appears at the cut end of the petiole of the leaf.	[]
In Fig.	[]
5A the average turgor pressure values are plotted which were calculated from 3 - 8 min long measurements.	[]
Inspection of Fig.	[]
5A - C shows that Pc exhibited similar diurnal changes as the Pp values at 0. 2 m, 6 m, and 10 m height.	[]
Changes in Pc after sunrise preceded changes in Pp, most likely due to the different measuring sites on the leaflets.	[]
After the onset of transpiration the loss of turgor pressure of cells located at the periphery of the leaflets ( where Pp is recorded) is apparently immediately compensated by water shifting from the xylem and the cells located close to the main vein ( where Pc is measured).	[]
Consistent with this explanation, towards the afternoon when all cells throughout the leaflets exhibit low turgor pressure, the increase in Pc and the decrease in Pp occurred nearly concomitantly.	[]
Interestingly, the delay between the response of Pc and Pp upon changes in T and r. h. in the early morning hours decreased from about 2. 5 h at 0. 2 m height to 1. 5 h at 6 m height, and to 1 h at 10 m height.	[]
In Fig.	[]
5D the Pp values measured at the three heights are plotted against the corresponding Pc values ( i. e. neglecting the delayed response of Pp).	[]
The curves could be fitted quite well by equation 8.	[]
Fitting of the curves required the assumption of different values for the constants a and b in equation 4 ( see legend to Fig. 5) indicating that the elastic properties of the leaves were different, presumably due to changes of the ambient temperature with height ( see above).	[]
Turgor pressure measurements at 5 m height failed because of abundant mucilage in the leaflet tissue at this time of the year.	[]
Mucilage in the cells and xylem vessels was less abundant when turgor pressure measurements were performed during the summer of 1999.	[]
Plot of the Pc data measured by Th u rmer et al.	[]
( 1999) at 5 m height against online recordings of Pp in May 2007 revealed very good agreement between both parameters, even though the microcapillary was inserted into cells located on the upper leaflet surface between the main vein and the leaflet edge ( Fig. 6).	[]
On both measuring days in 1999 and 2007, similar environmental conditions existed.	[]
Inspection of Fig.	[]
6 shows that Pp measured at 6 m height was delayed by c.	[]
1. 5 h.	[]
A plot of the Pp values against the Pc values according to Fig.	[]
5D could also be fitted very well by equation 8 ( see inset of Fig. 6) indicating the validity of equation 8 to describe properly the relationship between Pp and Pc.	[]
Discussion	[]
The results presented here demonstrate that the novel patch clamp pressure probe is a very sensitive, versatile, and easy - to - handle plant - based tool for online monitoring of the effects of evapotranspiration and / or of irrigation regimes on the water relations of leaves ( Figs 2, 3).	[]
The probe measures the output signal upon application of a constantly clamped pressure, i. e. the pressure transfer function of leaf patches.	[]
Since the application of the probe is not restricted to special leaves, patch clamp pressure measurements will readily show which crop varieties can be grown with the least water for the most yield.	[]
It has also been demonstated here that the plant - based data can be sent by small telemetric units connected to the patch clamp pressure probes to a receiver base station which logs and stores the data pending transfer to a GPRS modem linked to an Internet server.	[]
The telemetric systems operated faultlessly.	[]
This is a very important result because there is agreement between scientists and growers ( Jones, 2004) that control of irrigation must be tied to remote sensing devices in order to reduce manpower and to conserve water.	[]
The patch clamp pressure probe technique introduced here meets these demands.	[]
A further advantage is that the probe is cheap and easy to handle.	[]
Some care is required only when clamping the leaf.	[]
Leaves must be clean and any rough surface topography must be avoided.	[]
This implies that the dimensions of the pads of the spring clamp must be adjusted to the size of the intercostal area since non - uniform contact between leaf surface and pads lowered the output pressure signal.	[]
Experience collected with patch clamp pressure measurements on T. voinierianum and on preliminary results of other plants ( e. g. grapevines, bananas, Eucalyptus, and Arabidopsis) showed that a smooth intercostal leaf area for clamping can readily be found.	"bananas	142	149	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bananas"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Equally, optimum values for the clamp pressure can also be relatively quickly selected empirically if the guidelines mentioned above are followed.	[]
For many purposes calibration of the leaf patch clamp pressure probe against the cell turgor pressure probe is not stringent.	[]
It may be sufficient to know that the transfer function assumes small values at full turgescence and is nearly unity at low turgescence.	[]
However, for scientific reasons and for the application of the probe in basic research, the dependency of the transfer function on cell turgor pressure might be of great interest.	[]
The theoretical considerations have demonstrated that the relationship between the transfer function and the turgor pressure can obviously be described by equation 8, i. e. by a power function.	[]
Concomitant measurements of turgor pressure and patch clamp pressure have confirmed the theoretical considerations ( Fig. 5).	[]
Analogous recordings of turgor pressure and patch clamp pressure on grapevines, bananas, and Eucalyptus trees also yielded results ( D Zimmermann, unpublished results) which were consistent with the predictions of equation 8.	"bananas	80	87	Organism/Species"	"Eucalyptus	93	103	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bananas"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Eucalyptus"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Patch clamp pressure measurements allow, therefore, calculation of turgor pressures if the constants a and b defined by equation 4 are known.	[]
These parameters can be obtained by numerical fitting of Pp versus Pc curves.	[]
Online patch clamp pressure measurements open up new possibilities to unravel the hydraulic communication among leaves, including tall trees.	[]
It is shown here that the patch clamp pressure can simultaneously be monitored in shaded or sun - exposed leaflets at different heights under greenhouse conditions by using several probes.	[]
It was even possible to measure the turgor pressure at different sites on the leaf.	[]
Therefore, water shifting between leaf cells via the apoplastic and symplastic pathways can be studied.	[]
Physically sound theories are available ( Molz and Ikenberry, 1974; Molz et al., 1979), but experimental facts are not available or are mainly based on speculations ( Steudle and French, 1996).	[]
The first evidence for the dynamics of the hydraulic communication between leaflets at different height and within leaflets is given here.	[]
Th u rmer et al.	[]
( 1999) have shown by using the xylem and turgor pressure probe that the decrease in local xylem pressure after daybreak from positive, sub - atmospheric or slightly above - atmospheric values to negative values was associated with an almost 1: 1 decrease in turgor pressure of the cells located close to the main vein of the leaflets ( see also Zimmermann et al., 2004).	[]
Similarly, in the afternoon, the increase of xylem pressure in non - cavitated vessels towards more positive values correlated with a 1: 1 increase in cell turgor pressure.	[]
Obviously, changes in transpiration resulted in a very rapid establishment of a new local water equilibrium state between the xylem and the turgor pressure of the adjacent cells.	[]
The turgor pressure measurements of Th u rmer et al.	[]
( 1999) were performed at 1 m and 5 m height.	[]
No significant differences in the turgor pressure values were found over the day.	[]
The turgor pressure measurements at 0. 2 m height reported here confirmed the finding of Th u rmer et al.	[]
( 1999) that the turgor pressure in the cells located near the main vein dropped immediately upon daybreak.	[]
However, our patch clamp pressure measurements at the periphery of the leaflets imply that the turgor pressure of these cells apparently had a significantly delayed response upon the onset of transpiration.	[]
This finding can be taken as evidence that turgor pressure gradients are temporarily generated within the leaf during the early morning hours.	[]
This delay in the response of patch clamp pressure after daybreak was c.	[]
1 h for leaves at the top, but c.	[]
2. 5 h for leaves at the base.	[]
The data suggest that with progression of the day the gradients collapsed first at the top of the liana, where transpiration was high, before it occurred in leaves further down.	[]
During the afternoon hours the increase in the turgor pressure values measured close to the main vein coincided with the values measured by the patch clamp pressure probe ( Fig. 5).	[]
The unbalanced osmotic pressure throughout the leaflets obviously favoured simultaneous turgor pressure regeneration in all leaflet cells.	[]
The process seemed to be very similar to the refilling of the cells of the resurrection plant Myrothamnus flabellifolia with water after desiccation ( Wagner et al., 2000).	"Myrothamnus flabellifolia	94	119	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Myrothamnus flabellifolia"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Uniform radial refilling of cells with water in this species is also driven by the unbalanced osmotic pressure throughout the tissue.	[]
As indicated by Fig.	[]
4A and B, restoration of full turgescence in T. voinierianum was faster than the preceding turgor pressure loss if the lianas were well - watered.	[]
By contrast, limitations in water supply resulted in the coincidence of the phases of turgor pressure loss and regeneration.	[]
Interestingly, watering of the lianas after non - irrigation seemed to lead preferentially to water shifting to the top of the plant, because, after 3 d of irrigation, turgor pressure regeneration during the afternoon was very fast again at 10 m height ( Fig. 4F), but not at 5 m height ( Fig. 4E).	[]
Rapid water movement to the top is expected if hydrostatic pressure, osmotic pressure, and / or gel - based gradients throughout the vessels exist or are generated rapidly in the afternoon when cavitation has occurred.	[]
This was demonstrated by Benkert et al.	[]
( 1995) and Th u rmer et al.	[]
( 1999) by using the xylem pressure probe.	[]
Continuous xylem pressure gradients during the morning hours can also explain why changes in Pp at lower heights were frequently found which could not be correlated with changes in local temperature or relative humidity.	[]
Water loss at the top of the plant induces a drop in xylem pressure which is transferred rapidly to the basal leaves where it induces a temporary turgor pressure loss that is soon compensated by water uptake from the roots ( arrow in Fig. 2).	[]
Even though more work is required, the present study shows that the leaf patch clamp pressure probe is a promising tool to elucidate short - and long - distance water transport in T. voinierianum and other plants.	[]
CHEK2 Mutations Affecting Kinase Activity Together With Mutations in TP53 Indicate a Functional Pathway Associated with Resistance to Epirubicin in Primary Breast Cancer	[]
Abstract	[]
Background	[]
Chemoresistance is the main obstacle to cure in most malignant diseases.	[]
Anthracyclines are among the main drugs used for breast cancer therapy and in many other malignant conditions.	[]
Single parameter analysis or global gene expression profiles have failed to identify mechanisms causing in vivo resistance to anthracyclines.	[]
While we previously found TP53 mutations in the L2 / L3 domains to be associated with drug resistance, some tumors harboring wild - type TP53 were also therapy resistant.	[]
The aim of this study was; 1) To explore alterations in the TP53 gene with respect to resistance to a regular dose epirubicin regimen ( 90 mg / m2 every 3 week) in patients with primary, locally advanced breast cancer; 2) Identify critical mechanisms activating p53 in response to DNA damage in breast cancer; 3) Evaluate in vitro function of Chk2 and p14 proteins corresponding to identified mutations in the CHEK2 and p14 ( ARF) genes; and 4) Explore potential CHEK2 or p14 ( ARF) germline mutations with respect to family cancer incidence.

Methods and Findings	[]
Snap - frozen biopsies from 109 patients collected prior to epirubicin ( as preoperative therapy were investigated for TP53, CHEK2 and p14 ( ARF) mutations by sequencing the coding region and p14 ( ARF) promoter methylations.	"patients	32	40	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
TP53 mutastions were associated with chemoresistance, defined as progressive disease on therapy ( p = 0. 0358; p = 0. 0136 for mutations affecting p53 loop domains L2 / L3).	[]
Germline CHEK2 mutations ( n = 3) were associated with therapy resistance ( p = 0. 0226).	[]
Combined, mutations affecting either CHEK2 or TP53 strongly predicted therapy resistance ( p = 0. 0101; TP53 mutations restricted to the L2 / L3 domains: p = 0. 0032).	[]
Two patients progressing on therapy harbored the CHEK2 mutation, Arg95Ter, completely abrogating Chk2 protein dimerization and kinase activity.	"patients	4	12	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

No mutation or promoter hypermethylation in p14 ( ARF) were detected.	[]
Conclusion	[]
This study is the first reporting an association between CHEK2 mutations and therapy resistance in human cancers and to document mutations in two genes acting direct up / down - stream to each other to cause therapy failure, emphasizing the need to investigate functional cascades in future studies.

Introduction	[]
Chemoresistance is the main obstacle to cure in most malignancies, including breast cancer.	[]
While adjuvant chemotherapy may reduce the hazard rate of relapse by about one third in breast cancer patients [ 1], the majority among patients harboring micro - metastases are not cured by today ' s standards.

Considering patients harboring distant metastases, resistance and therapy failure inevitably occurs, in general over a time period of less than one year for each individual regimen [ 2].	"patients	12	20	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Despite extensive experimental research [ 3], little data are available considering chemoresistance in vivo.	[]
For anthracycline therapy in breast cancer, topoisomerase - II amplifications have been associated with a dose - responsiveness different from what is observed in non - amplified tumors 4, 5.	[]
"Several studies have tried to generate "" prediction profiles "" based on gene expression microarrays [ 6], [ 7], [ 8], however, none of the different profiles generated expressed a sensitivity suitable for clinical applications, or have been successfully reproduced by others ( see references to original works in [ 9] and [ 10])."	[]
p53 ( the protein encoded by the TP53 gene) plays a key role in executing DNA - damage induced apoptosis and growth arrest [ 11].	[]
Previously, our group reported mutations in the zink - binding domains L2 ( codons 163 - 195) and L3 ( codons 236 - 251) of p53 critical to DNA binding [ 12] to be associated with but not fully predictive for resistance to chemotherapy with a low - dose weekly anthracycline [ 13] or a mitomycin plus 5 - fluoro - uracil containing [ 14] regimen.	[]
Similar findings were reported by another group [ 15].	[]
In contrast, others reported TP53 mutations to predict sensitivity to a dose - dense epirubicin - cyclophosphamide regimen [ 16].	[]
The finding that some tumors harboring wild - type TP53 may be resistant to anthracycline therapy lead us to postulate that other genes involved in the p53 pathway could be mutated in these tumors [ 3].	[]
p53 is activated by post - translational modifications, and the protein is phosphorylated at multiple amino acids [ 17].	[]
Phosphorylation at Ser 20 ( Ser 23 in mice) by the Chk2 protein ( coded by the CHEK2 gene) in response to DNA damage activates p53 by inhibiting binding to, and deactivation by, the MDM2 ( Mouse Minute 2 homolog; HDM2) protein [ 18], [ 19], [ 20].	"mice	38	42	Organism/Species"	"Mouse	189	194	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Mouse"", ""start_span"": 189, ""end_span"": 194, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
While experimental studies have suggested a critical role of Chk2 in activating p53 apoptotic response to genotoxic stress [ 21], [ 22], others claim Chk2 to be dispensable for p53 activation with respect to apoptosis as well as growth arrest [ 23].	[]
Following an initial report of a CHEK2 germline mutation in a family filling the characteristics of a Li - Fraumeni syndrome ( LFS) [ 24], recent papers have suggested germline mutations in CHEK2 to be associated with a moderately increased risk of breast and colon cancers ( see references in [ 25]).	[]
Recently, we discovered a somatic, nonsense CHEK2 mutation in a single patient expressing resistance to doxorubicin low dose therapy [ 26].	"patient	71	78	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
A second mechanism of p53 activation is through p14 ( ARF) ( p19 in mice) function.	"mice	68	72	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
p14 ( ARF) does not phosphorylate p53, but inhibits MDM2 dependent p53 degradation through direct MDM2 binding.	[]
While p14 ( ARF) - mediated p53 activation has been linked to oncogene - induced p53 activation and, in general, considered not involved in response to DNA damage ( see references in [ 27]), p14 ( ARF) may be activated through the E2F1 / retinoblastoma pathway [ 28].	[]
Importantly, two recent studies revealed lack of p19 ( mouse homologue of human p14 ( ARF)) function in mice to inhibit p53 tumor suppressor function in response to ionizing radiation as well as DNA damaging agents [ 29], [ 30].	"mouse	55	60	Organism/Species"	"human	74	79	Organism/Species"	"mice	104	108	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The aim of this study was 1) to explore alterations in the TP53 gene with respect to resistance to a regular dose epirubicin regimen ( 90 mg / m2 body surface every 3 week) in patient with primary, locally advanced, breast cancer; 2) To explore defects in potential mechanisms activating p53 in response to DNA damage in breast cancer as a cause of drug resistance in wild - type tumors.	"patient	176	183	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 176, ""end_span"": 183, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
To do so, we sequenced the complete coding regions for the CHEK2 and p14 ( ARF) genes and analyzed for p14 ( ARF) promoter hypermetylations; 3) Evaluate in vitro function of potential Chk2 and p14 ( ARF) protein translates corresponding to identified mutations in the CHEK2 and p14 ( ARF) genes; 4) Identify potential TP53, CHEK2 and p14 ( ARF) mutations to be germline, explore the incidence of different cancers among affected relatives with respect to specific mutations.	[]
By comparing in vitro characteristics of specific mutations to drug sensitivity and family cancer risk syndromes, this may add to our understanding of the importance of these gene cascades executing response to DNA damage versus tumor suppression activity.	[]
Analyzing tumor samples from a total of 109 primary locally advanced breast cancer patients treated with epirubicin 90mg / 3 weekly, we found TP53 mutations affecting the L2 / L3 domains or protein dimerization, as well as non - functional CHEK2 mutations abrogating dimerization and phosphorylation, to be associated with therapy resistance; no mutation or promoter hypermethylations of the p14 ( ARF) gene was discovered.	"patients	83	91	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Our findings suggest a critical role for Chk2 with respect to DNA - damage - dependent p53 activation and resistance to anthracycline therapy in human breast cancer.	"human	145	150	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

A total of 223 patients with locally advanced non - inflammatory breast cancer ( T3 - 4 and / or N2) were randomly allocated to primary treatment either with epirubicin 90 mg / m2 or paclitaxel 200 mg / m2.	"patients	15	23	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The primary aim of the study was identification of markers predicting drug resistance to the regimens.	[]
Thus, the reason for randomizing patients was not for effect comparison, but to achieve similar patient cohorts in the two arms.	"patients	33	41	Organism/Species"	"patient	33	40	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Based on the findings of a clinical lack of cross - resistance between anthracyclines and taxane therapies in breast cancer [ 31], we hypothesized the mechanisms of resistance to be different between the two compounds.	[]
While the analysis of tumor samples from the paclitaxel is ongoing, we here report our findings from the patients allocated to the epirubicin arm.	"patients	105	113	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

Two patients were analyzed for gene mutations but omitted from statistical analysis as protocol violators; histopathological examination revealed one patient ( Epi089) to harbor a sarcomatoid tumor, while one patient Epi232 was erroneously enrolled with stage II disease.

The study protocol was approved by the Regional Ethical Committee ( Norwegian Health Region III), including formal Biobank registration in accordance to Norwegian law.	[]
The study and protocol is registered under the Norwegian Social Science Data services ( ( www. nsd / uib / personvern / database /), University of Bergen project no 16297 and Helse Bergen project no 13025).	[]
Each patient gave written informed consent.	"patient	5	12	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Tissue Sampling	[]
Before commencing chemotherapy, each patient had an incisional tumor biopsy as described previously [ 14].	"patient	37	44	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
All tissue samples were snap - frozen immediately on removal in the theatre.	[]
Treatment Regime and Staging	[]
Primary treatment consisted of epirubicin ( 90 mg / m2) administered as a 3 - weekly schedule.	[]
Treatment was scheduled for four cycles unless progression occurred at an earlier stage.	[]
Clinical response was assessed before each treatment cycle, and the final response evaluated 3 weeks after the 4th cycle for overall response classification.	[]
"Because the protocol was implemented by October 1997 with patients enrolled between November 1997 and December 2003, responses were consistently graded by the UICC system [ 32] and not the more recently implemented "" RECIST "" criteria [ 33]."	"patients	58	66	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Thus, responses were classified as CR ( Complete Response, complete disappearance of all tumor lesions), PR ( Partial Response, reduction > = 50% in the sum of all tumor lesions, calculated for each as the product of the largest diameter and the one perpendicular to it), PD ( Progressive Disease, increase in the diameter product of any individual tumor lesion by > = 25%), and SD ( Stable Disease, anything between PR and PD).	[]
To analyze for the predictive value of the different parameters, similar to our previous studies [ 13], [ 14] we compared PD tumors ( non responders) with the combined group of tumors classified as SD / PR / CR ( responders); the reason for this approach is discussed in detail elsewhere [ 34].	[]
Median follow - up time was defined from patient inclusion in the study up to October 31, 2006.	"patient	41	48	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Deaths attributable to causes other than breast cancer were treated as censored observations.	[]
All patient records were subject to central audit for response classification ( by E. L., B. O. and P. E. L.).	"patient	4	11	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Response classifications were completed and approved without any knowledge about result from laboratory analysis.	[]
RNA Purification	[]
Total RNA was purified by Trizol ( Life Technologies, Inc.) extraction from snap - frozen tissue samples according to manufacturer ' s instructions.	[]
After extraction, the RNA was dissolved in 100 micro l of DEPC treated ddH2O.	[]
cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using Transcriptor reverse transcriptase ( Roche), according to the manufacturer ' s protocol.	[]
DNA Purification	[]
Genomic DNA from tumor biopsies and blood lymphocytes was isolated using QIAamp DNA Mini kit ( Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturer ' s protocol.	[]
Mutation Analysis	[]
All mutational analysis was performed blinded to clinical data.	[]
Mutations in TP53, CHEK2 and p14 ( ARF) genes were analyzed by PCR ( or nested PCR) amplification and sequencing of PCR product, or by cloning of PCR products and sequencing of the resulting plasmids ( all primers described in Table 1).	[]
Cloning was performed using the TOPO TA Cloning kit ( Invitrogen).	[]
Sequencing of clones was performed until at least 10 different sequences covered all parts of the CHEK2 coding sequence.	[]
DNA sequencing was carried out directly on 1 micro l PCR product or plasmid using Big Dye terminator mix ( Applied Biosystems).	[]
Capillary gel electrophoresis, data collection, and sequence analysis were done on an automated DNA sequencer ( ABI 3700).	[]
When a mutation was detected, the relevant exon was amplified by PCR from genomic tumor DNA and DNA from blood lymphocytes and sequenced for verification and germline detection.	[]
( Primers described in Table 1).	[]
Loss of Heterozygosity ( LOH)	[]
Loss of heterozygosity ( LOH) in tumors with mutations in CHEK2 was assessed using the microsatellite marker, D22S275, which maps to intron 4 of CHEK2.	[]
LOH in tumors with mutation in TP53 was assessed using two markers, one variable number tandem repeat in intron 1 [ 35] and a CA repeat close to the TP53 gene [ 36].	[]
Fluorescently end - labeled primers were used in the PCR, and the PCR products were analyzed on an ABI 3700.	[]
LOH was evaluated by comparing the allele peak - height ratios from blood DNA and tumor DNA.	[]
A sample was scored as having AI ( Allelic Imbalance) when a reduction in peak height of one allele in tumor sample was at least 18% compared with that of blood DNA from the same patient [ 37].

Analysis of p14 ( ARF) promoter methylation	[]
Genomic DNA was subjected to bisulphate conversion using the CpGenome DNA Modification Kit ( Intergen) according to the manufacturer ' s protocol.	[]
Both the unmethylated - and methylated - specific PCRs were performed in 50 micro l reaction mixes containing 2. 5 U AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase ( Applied Biosystems), 1 x PCR buffer, 1. 5 mM MgCl2, 0. 1 mM of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 0. 2 micro M of each primer ( Table 1) and 2 micro l of modified genomic DNA.	[]
Thermocycling conditions for both the unmethylated - and methylated - specific PCRs were an initial step of 5 minutes at 95 degrees C followed by 35 cycles of 30 sec. at 94 degrees C, 30 sec. at 60. 5 degrees C and 60 sec. at 72 degrees C before a final elongation step at 72 degrees C for 7 min.	[]
Chk2 Dimerisation	[]
Chk2 mutant ' s ability to form dimers with the wild - type protein was investigated by immunoprecipitation.	[]
U - 2 - OS cells were co - transfected with expression vectors expressing wild - type Chk2 with N - terminal Xpr - tag ( pcDNA4 / HisMax, Invitrogen) and mutated Chk2 forms with C - terminal V5 - tag ( pcDNA3. 1 / V5 - His, Invitrogen).	[]
Transfection was performed using FuGene 6. 0 transfection reagent ( Roche) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions.	[]
Cells were harvested in lysisbuffer ( 50 mM TrisHCl pH 8. 0, 150 mM NaCl, 0. 5% NP40, 5 mM EDTA pH 8. 0) 48 hours after transfection.	[]
An aliquote of the cell lysate was harvested for subsequent Chk2 - mutant - V5 transfection verification.	[]
Samples were further incubated with A / G Pluss Agarose beads ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 degrees C for 25 minutes before the beads were removed by centrifugation at 5000g for 4 minutes and the samples were incubated with 1. 5 micro g anti - V5 ( Invitrogen) at 4 degrees C for 90 minutes.	[]
Fresh A / G Pluss Agarose beads were added and the samples were incubated for another 90 minutes at 4 degrees C.	[]
The beads were washed three times with 1 x PBS, before being separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and blotted on to a nitrocellulose membrane.	[]
Chk2 - wild - type - Xpr co - precipitated with Chk2 - mutant - V5 was detected through incubations with anti - Xpr antibody ( Invitrogen), HRP - conjugated secondary antibody and ECL detection reagent ( GE Healthcare).	[]
Kinase Activity	[]
Chk2 mutant ' s ability to function as kinases was investigated through an in vitro kinase assay.	[]
The V5 expression vectors used for the dimerisation study were also used to express Chk2 mutants in the kinase assay.	[]
U - 2 - OS cells were transfected using the FuGene 6. 0 transfection reagent ( Roche) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions.	[]
Cells were then incubated at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 and humidified atmosphere.	[]
After 24 hours doxorubicin ( Nycomed Pharma) was added to the media to a final concentration of 50ng / ml and the cells were further incubated for 24 hours before harvest.	[]
75 cm2 of 90% confluent cells were harvested in 500 micro l lysis buffer ( 50 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0. 5% Triton X - 100, 2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EDTA), and the cytosol was incubated for 90 minutes at 4 degrees C with 50 micro l 50% Glutathione Sepharose beads ( Amersham Biosciences) linked to anti - V5 antibody ( Invitrogen).	[]
The beads were then washed twice with lysisbuffer containing 500 mM NaCl and twice with kinase assay buffer ( 50 mM HEPES, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM MnCl2, 2. 5 mM EGTA).	[]
The beads received 30 micro l kinase assay buffer with 7. 5 micro M cold ATP, 10 micro Ci 32P - gamma - ATP ( GE Healthcare) and 2 micro g isolated Cdc25C peptide, and was incubated at 30 degrees C for 30 minutes.	[]
Samples were separated on a 12. 5% polyacrylamide gel and blotted on to a nitrocellulose membrane.	[]
A radiosensitive imaging plate was exposed to the membrane and the plate was read in a FLA200 imager ( Fuji).	[]
The kinase assay described above was also used to determine the Chk2 mutants ' kinase activity after co - transfection of each Chk2 mutant and wild - type Chk2 in equal amounts.	[]
Statistical Analysis	[]
Statistical analysis was performed using the Primer of Biostatistics system, version 5. 0 [ 38].	[]
The differences in the distribution of TP53 and CHEK2 mutations among patients revealing a PD and the responders were analyzed with use of Fisher ' s exact test.	"patients	70	78	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
P - values are reported as accumulated two - sided.	[]
Because of the limited time of the follow - up, no formal statistical assessment of overall survival was performed.	[]
Relapse - free survival was analyzed by the log - rank test.	[]
Details regarding outcome in individual patients with mutations are shown in Table 2 and 3 to make them available to the reader.	"patients	40	48	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Results	[]
TP53 Mutations and Response to Therapy	[]
The TP53 mutations identified in the tumors of the patients treated with epirubicin together with the clinical response to therapy and follow - up data are presented in Table 2.	"patients	51	59	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Somatic TP53 mutations were identified in 23 ( 21. 5%) of the patients.	"patients	62	70	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Normal tissue ( WBC) was available from 18 of these for germline characterization, revealing none of the mutations identified to be germline alterations.	[]
Of the 23 mutations detected, 20 were missense and 3 were nonsense.	[]
One mutation ( del483CAT) has not been reported previously either in breast cancer or in any other tumor type ( IARC database: http: / / www. iarc. fr / p53 /).	[]
Twelve of the mutations directly or indirectly affected the L2 / L3 domains of the p53 protein ( Table 2) previous found to predict a poor prognosis [ 39] and drug resistance [ 14], [ 40].	[]
For statistical comparison, mutation Gly325Ter ( patient Epi215) located to the tetramerization domain is grouped together with the mutations affecting the L2 / L3 domain, since this mutation leads to truncation of the protein and with loss of tetramerization and functional defects similar to L2 / L3 mutations [ 41].	"patient	49	56	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
There was a statistical significant correlation between TP53 mutation status and lack of treatment response ( PD) ( Table 4; p = 0. 0358; Fisher exact test).	[]
When tumors harboring TP53 mutations affecting the p53 L2 / L3 DNA - binding domains were compared to those with wild - type TP53 or TP53 mutations outside the L2 / L3 domains, this correlation was further strengthened ( p = 0. 0136).	[]
The previously described TP53 polymorphism, Arg72Pro [ 42] was detected in 31 ( 29%) of our patients.	"patients	92	100	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
No correlation was found between this polymorphism and lack of treatment response ( p = 0. 2750; Fisher exact test) or TP53 mutational status ( p = 0. 2024).	[]
CHEK2 Mutations and Response to Therapy	[]
Table 3 presents the patients with detected CHEK2 mutations together with a description of the clinical response and follow up - data.	"patients	21	29	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
CHEK2 mutations were identified in three out of the 109 patients ( 2. 8%).	"patients	56	64	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Notably, each of the CHEK2 mutations identified was also present in patient lymphocyte DNA, confirming a germline origin.	"patient	68	75	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The Arg95Ter ( C283T) mutation is novel.	[]
This mutation was present in two patients ( Epi132 and Epi203) living in different parts of Norway with no known family relationship.	"patients	33	41	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
However, linkage analysis using microsatellite markers ( D22S275, D22S272, D22S1172 and D22S423) suggested a common founder mutation ( data not shown).	[]
The C283T transition generates a novel stop codon in exon 1 of CHEK2, leading to truncation of the Chk2 protein.	[]
LOH analysis indicated loss of the wild - type CHEK2 allele in the both tumors from the two patients harboring this mutation ( Epi132 and Epi203).	"patients	92	100	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Both these tumors were non - responsive to epirubicin therapy ( PD).	[]
In contrast, the third patient with a germline CHEK2 mutation ( patient Epi151; point mutation at T1091C, Ile364Thr) had a partial response to epirubicin therapy.	"patient	23	30	Organism/Species"	"patient	23	30	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This tumor was non - informative with respect to LOH.	[]
Taking all CHEK2 mutations together, they predicted resistance to epirubicin ( p = 0. 0226).	[]
The previously described silent Glu84Glu ( A252G) polymorphism [ 24], [ 43] in exon 1 was detected in two ( 1. 9%) patients.	"patients	115	123	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
No association between this polymorphism and treatment response was recorded.	[]
One of the tumors ( Epi203) harboring the C283T substitution ( Arg95Ter) also harbored a somatic TP53 mutation in codon 175, Arg175His, located in the L2 domain of p53 ( Table 2).	[]
This mutation was detected in another four of our patients treated with epirubicin ( Table 2).	"patients	50	58	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In addition, TP53 Arg175His mutation was recorded in one patient of our previous study evaluating response to doxorubicin [ 13].	"patient	57	64	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The fact that none of the Arg175His patients presented here or in our previous study revealed resistance to therapy ( PD) suggests this mutation may not cause resistance to anthracyclines in breast cancers in vivo.	"patients	36	44	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Omitting the tumor harboring both a CHEK2 and a TP53 mutation ( patient Epi203) from statistical analysis, Chk2 mutations ( n = 2) were non - significantly associated with therapy resistance ( p = 0. 1633).	"patient	64	71	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In a previous study [ 26], however, we analyzed for CHEK2 mutation status in relation to therapy outcome in a cohort of patients from doxorubicin study [ 13].	"patients	120	128	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In that study [ 26], we detected the previously identified mutation Ile157Thr.	[]
In addition, we detected a novel nonsense somatic mutation ( 1368InsA).	[]
This mutation was associated with lack of function in vitro; moreover, it was associated with drug resistance in vivo.	[]
Analyzing our material and this cohort [ 26] together, ( n = 160), CHEK2 mutations ( n = 5 in total) predicted for resistance to doxorubicin and epirubicin therapy ( p = 0. 0123).	[]
Even though, excluding patient Epi203 ( harboring TP53 Arg175His and Arg95Ter CHEK2 mutation) as well as other patients harboring TP53 L2 / L3 mutations ( n = 129), CHEK2 mutations ( n = 4 in total) predicted for resistance to doxorubicin and epirubicin therapy ( p = 0. 030).

TP53 and CHEK2 Mutations Combined and Response to Therapy	[]
Assuming that TP53 and CHEK2 mutations may substitute for each other, we analyzed for the predictive effect of mutations in both genes.	[]
The occurrence of a mutation affecting either CHEK2 or TP53 strongly predicted therapy resistance ( p = 0. 0101; Fisher exact test).	[]
When tumors harboring TP53 - L2 / L3 mutations and CHEK2 mutations were compared with those wild - type or TP53 mutations outside the L2 / L3 domain, the correlation was further strengthened ( p = 0. 0032; Fisher exact test).	[]
The significance was preserved when comparing patients with a PD to objective responders ( CR and PR) excluding patients with stable disease ( SD) from the statistical analysis ( Table 4).

p14 ( ARF) Mutations and Promoter Methylations	[]
Neither mutations nor polymorphisms in the coding region of p14 ( ARF) were observed among the 107 patients analyzed.	"patients	99	107	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Likewise, no promoter methylations were detected.	[]
Influence of CHEK2 and TP53 Mutation Status on Relapse - Free Survival	[]
Because of the limited time of the follow - up, no formal statistical assessment of overall survival was performed.	[]
Details regarding outcome for individual patients with mutations are described in Table 2 and 3 to make these data available to the reader.	"patients	41	49	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Relapse - free survival is depicted in ( Figure 1).	[]
Figure 1A shows relapse - free survival for the patients with TP53 and CHEK2 mutations ( all mutations found) compared to patients without any TP53 or CHEK2 mutations, no difference in relapse - free survival was observed.	"patients	48	56	Organism/Species"	"patients	48	56	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Similar, no difference was seen when grouping TP53 mutations outside L2 / L3 and CHEK2 mutation not affecting kinase function ( Ile364Thr) as wild - type ( Figure 1B).	[]
Grouping tumors harboring a mutation in L2 / L3 together with CHEK2 mutations affecting kinase domain ( Arg95Ter) in one group, mutations outside TP53 L2 / L3 and Ile364Thr as one group and tumors without any found mutations in TP53 and CHEK2 separately, again no noticeably difference in relapse - free survival were seen ( Figure 1C).	[]
Notably, in addition to a short median follow - up time, a total of 35 patients with a sub - optimal response to epirubicin received subsequent treatment with paclitaxel, which may have influenced the outcome.

CHEK2 Mutant ' s Capability to Form Dimers	[]
To investigate whether the identified CHEK2 mutations affect the ability of the Chk2 protein to form dimers, co - transfection and immunopresipitation of V5 - tagged mutants and Xpress - tagged wild - type Chk2 were performed using CHEK2 low - expressing U - 2 - OS cells.	[]
As we identified the previously characterized CHEK2 germline mutants variants Arg117His ( n = 2 and Ile157Thr ( n = 1) among patients allocated to primary treatment with paclitaxel in our ongoing study, these mutants were evaluated together with Arg95Ter and Ile364Thr.	"patients	125	133	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The results presented in Figure 2 show that all Chk2 variants carrying a point mutation were able to form dimers with wild - type Chk2, whereas the Arg95Ter variant was not.	[]
Kinase Activity of CHEK2 Mutants	[]
To investigate whether the identified CHEK2 mutants retained the wild - type kinase activity, an in vitro Chk2 kinase assay with respect to Chk2 autophosphorylation and Cdc25 substrate phosphorylation was performed.	[]
The U - 2 - OS cells were preferred for this assay because they were previously found to express only low levels of endogenous Chk2 [ 44].	[]
This was confirmed by us using an antibody recognizing endogenous protein ( data not shown).	[]
These cells have previously been used by other investigators to study Chk2 kinase activity [ 44], [ 45], [ 46].	[]
The two mutants Arg117Gly and Ile157Thr were previously tested for in vitro kinase activity [ 47], but were both included here, together with wild - type CHEK2 as controls.	[]
Compared to wild - type Chk2, the Ile157Thr mutant retained wild - type kinase activity.	[]
The mutant Ile364Thr showed partially reduced kinase activity both in term of Cdc25 - phosphorylation and autophosphorylation ( Figure 3).	[]
In contrast, the mutant Arg117Gly showed strongly reduced kinase activity while the Arg95Ter mutant was totally devoid of any Chk2 kinase activity.	[]
The activity recorded for Ile157Thr and Arg117Gly was consistent with previously reported results for these two mutants [ 47].	[]
Notably, there was an internal consistency with respect to percentage activity reduction comparing individual mutants with respect to autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of Cdc25 ( Figure 3).	[]
Since enzymatically active Chk2 exists as dimers, it was important to determine the effect of Chk2 mutants on wild - type / mutant heterodimer kinase activity.	[]
The effect on Chk2 kinase activities ( Chk2 autophosphorylation and Cdc25 substrate phosphorylation) of the individual mutants were therefore determined after co - transfection with wild - type Chk2 as described in Materials and Methods.	[]
The results from this co - transfection - kinase assay ( Figure 4) were similar to those of the single - transfection assay ( Figure 3) except in the case of the Arg117Gly mutant, which expressed a substantial kinase activity when complexed with wild - type Chk2.	[]
This is consistent with previous data indicating that the Arg117Gly mutant has neglectable kinase activity itself but dimerizes efficiently to Chk2 wild - type without strongly affecting the wild - type Chk2 activity.	[]
Hence, the activity detected is probably caused by the co - transfected and co - precipitated wild - type protein.	[]
To rule out the possibility that endogenously expressed wild - type Chk2 contributed to observed Arg117Gly kinase activity shown in Figure 4, we compared the Arg117Gly variant activity in the presence or absence of co - transfected wild - type Chk2 to the activities of Arg95Ter under the same conditions.	[]
The Arg95Ter variant does not form dimers with wild - type Chk2.	[]
As seen in Figure 5, Arg117Gly, which forms dimers with Chk2 wild - type, allows increased activity when co - transfected with wild - type as compared to the corresponding activity for the Arg95Ter mutant.	[]
The fact that Arg117Gly, when transfected alone, displays very similar activity as Arg95Ter or negative control ( background levels), strongly indicates that the contribution of endogenous Chk2, which, similarly to exogenously expressed wild - type Chk2 co - precipitate with Arg117Gly is non - significant.	[]
Family Cancer Incidence in Relation to CHEK2 Germline Mutations	[]
Following an initial report of a family with a CHEK2 germline mutation expressing an increased cancer incidence resembling the Li - Fraumeni syndrome [ 24], recent studies have revealed the more common CHEK2 mutations to be associated with a moderately increased risk of breast and colorectal cancers.	[]
We hypothesized that CHEK2 mutations having a detrimental effect on drug sensitivity could be associated with a more aggressive, Li - Fraumeni or a Li - Fraumeni - like ( LFL) cancer syndrome [ 48].	[]
Except from the patient harboring the Ile364Thr mutation who did not have any known congestion of cancer disease in the family, a detailed assessment of family cancer history was performed for each patient harboring a germline CHEK2 mutation.	"patient	16	23	Organism/Species"	"patient	16	23	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The family cancer pedigrees are depicted in Figure 6.	[]
While patients harboring CHEK2 germline mutations revealed different types of cancers ( mainly breast and tumors of the gastrointestinal area) in their family, surprisingly, no distinct pattern discriminating families harboring the Arg95Ter mutation from the other CHEK2 mutated families could be identified.	"patients	6	14	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
One of them ( Epi203), who inherited the mutation from her father ' s side of the family, had no accumulation of either breast or colorectal cancer on that side.	[]
It should be noted, however, that two brothers of her fathers mother had prostate cancer, and two siblings of his father having hepatocellular carcinoma and bladder cancer, respectively), while the other expressed a disease pattern resembling what has been seen with the more common CHEK2 mutations, like del1100C [ 25].	[]
Discussion	[]
TP53 plays a key role as a tumor suppressor gene.	[]
Its protein product activates processes such as growth arrest, DNA repair, apoptosis and / or senescence in response to genotoxic damage as well as oncogene activity [ 49], [ 50].	[]
Despite being extensively studied, critical issues regarding regulation of the p53 protein remain poorly understood, and conflicting evidence obtained in different experimental systems make the clinical relevance of experimental data questionable.	[]
Chemoresistance is the main obstacle to cancer cure in most malignancies, including breast cancer.	[]
Previously, we found TP53 mutations affecting the L2 / L3 DNA binding domain to be associated with lack of responsiveness to doxorubicin monotherapy [ 13] as well as mitomycin and 5 - fluoro - uracil in concert [ 14].	[]
However, some tumors revealed therapy resistance despite harboring wild - type TP53.	[]
Postulating that these tumors may harbor genetic disturbances in genes playing a key role in the p53 pathway, we here sequenced TP53 along with CHEK2 and p14 ( ARF), the latter two known to play a critical role as p53 activators, in tumors from 109 patients treated with epirubicin monotherapy.	"patients	249	257	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 249, ""end_span"": 257, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Our results confirm TP53 mutations, in particular those affecting the L2 / L3 domains, to be associated with drug resistance.	[]
Most importantly, we also found CHEK2 mutations generating a non - functional protein in our in vitro assays to be associated with drug resistance.	[]
In contrast, none of our tumors harbored either mutations or expressed promoter hypermethylations affecting the p14.	[]
Based on in vitro assays, we were able to classify the different Chk2 mutants with respect to dimerization capability as well as kinase activity ( Chk2 autophosphorylation and Cdc25 substrate phosphorylation).	[]
In addition, the kinase activities of the Chk2 wild - type / mutant complexes were monitored in co - transfection experiments.	[]
Notably, each point mutation ( except for Arg117Gly) revealed similar relative kinase efficacy whether co - transfected with wild - type Chk2 or not ( Figure 3 and 4).	[]
Cells co - transfected with Arg117Gly and wild - type Chk2 revealed kinase activity, probably due to the contribution of the wild type protein in Chk2 mutant - wild - type heterodimers.	[]
In contrast, cells transfected with Arg95Ter revealed no kinase activity whether co - transfected with wild - type Chk2 or not, clearly distinguishing this mutation from the others ( Figure 3 and 5).	[]
All in vitro assays were based on transfection of the U - 2 - OS cell line, a cell line known to express wild - type Chk2 at low levels, and previously used by other investigators to study Chk2 activity [ 44], [ 45], [ 46].	[]
Since we were not able to obtain satisfactory technical quality of the kinase assay in cell lines negative for Chk2 ( HCT 15 and HCT 116), we assessed potential background kinase activity due to endogenous Chk2 by performing western blot analysis revealing the endogenous levels of Chk2 in U - 2 - OS cells to be non - significant compared to the exogenously expressed Chk2 levels ( data not shown).	[]
We also performed a separate kinase assay, directly comparing the effect of binding partners for the dimerizing Arg117Gly and the non - dimerizing Arg95Ter.	[]
This assay also revealed the contribution of endogenous Chk2 to be non - significant ( Figure 5).	[]
Taking our in vitro findings together with in vivo observations, our present data confirm that the functionally defective CHEK2 Arg95Ter mutation, together with LOH, is associated with resistance to anthracycline therapy.	[]
In contrast, the patient harboring the Ile364Thr mutation, moderately reducing phosphorylation activity, responded well to therapy.	"patient	17	24	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The other missense mutations; Arg117Gly and Ile157Thr were observed among patients receiving paclitaxel therapy only; thus, their influence on anthracycline sensitivity in vivo could not be addressed.	"patients	74	82	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Yet, based on the finding that the Arg117Gly mutant expressed no intrinsic activity, but readily dimerized to the wild - type protein without abolishing its activity, we hypothesize that this mutation and, probably, other yet unidentified CHEK2 mutations with a similar lack of intrinsic kinase activity, may cause resistance to anthracycline therapy if combined with LOH in breast cancer.	[]
Our present findings have two major implications.	[]
First, we confirm that mutations in genes encoding proteins located within the same functional pathway may substitute for each other with respect to drug sensitivity, revealing for the first time a functional pathway critical to chemotherapy response in vivo.	[]
Second, the identification of mutations in the CHEK2 but not in the p14 ( ARF) gene in resistant tumors suggests that Chk2 mediated phosphorylation of p53 is a critical event in executing anti - tumor effect as a response to DNA damaging agents in breast cancer.	[]
This adds to our understanding not only of the function of p53 but Chk2 as well.	[]
p53 undergoes phosphorylation at multiple sites by different kinases, including Chk2 [ 51].	[]
While activation of the ATM leading to direct ( Ser 15) and Chk2 - mediated ( Ser 20) phosphorylation of p53 is considered an important mechanism for triggering p53 activation in response to DNA damage [ 52], some reports suggest ATM [ 53] and even Chk2 [ 23] to be redundant to this function.	[]
Importantly, Chk2 has been shown capable of inducing ATM - independent apoptosis in vitro [ 21].	[]
While Chk2 phosphorylates p53 at Ser 20, thereby stabilizing p53 by preventing MDM2 binding [ 19], Chk2 also phosphorylates p53 at six additional sites, including Ser 313 and Ser 314 located in the nuclear localization signal domain of p53 [ 51].	[]
In addition, Chk2 phosphorylates other important targets like BRCA1, Cdc25A and Cdc25C involved in DNA repair, G1 and G2 arrest, respectively [ 54].	[]
Despite the wide range of known Chk2 substrates relevant for DNA repair and cell cycle control, our present findings that CHEK2 mutations leading to non - functional Chk2 protein may substitute for p53 mutations strongly advocate a role for Chk2 with respect to drug sensitivity executed through p53 activation.	[]
Notably, one of the tumors ( Epi203) with the Arg95Ter CHEK2 mutation in addition harbored a somatic TP53 mutation, Arg175His, with allelic imbalance for the TP53 gene ( Table 2).	[]
Importantly, among another four patients in this study ( Epi063, Epi071, Epi087, Epi153) and one patient from our previous doxorubicin protocol [ 13] harboring the Arg175His mutation together with allelic imbalance for TP53, all five of these patients responded to anthracycline therapy either with a partial response or stable disease.	"patients	32	40	Organism/Species"	"patient	32	39	Organism/Species"	"patients	32	40	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In contrast, Epi132 and the only patient for whom we previously identified a non - functional CHEK2 mutation ( 1368InsA; coding for a non - functional protein translate with cytoplasmic location [ 26]) expressed resistance to epirubicin and doxorubicin, respectively.	"patient	33	40	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
"Arg175His is a p53 "" hot - spot "" structural mutation reported to have defects with respect to transcriptional activation and also to negatively interact with wild - type p53 [ 55]."	[]
While this mutation has been shown to enhance chemoresistance upon transfection into p53 null Saos - 2 cells [ 56], these osteosarcoma - derived cells may not necessarily be representative for breast cancers in vivo.	[]
Recent evidence strongly support p53 to be involved also in non - transcriptional mediated apoptosis by interacting with the Bcl - 2 / Bax system [ 57], and transcription - defect structural p53 mutants have been shown to execute non - transcriptional apoptosis in experimental systems [ 58].	[]
"Concomitant inactivation of Chk2 and p53 in breast cancer has been recorded by others [ 59], and the finding that a somatic mutation may generate a "" growth advantage "" in tumor cells already harboring a germline CHEK2 mutation may not implicate an effect on drug sensitivity in tumors not yet exposed to cytotoxic compounds."	[]
Rather, it may indicate a growth advantage, probably related to loss of p21 function.	[]
Notably, in a previous study we found the p21 polymorphism G251A to be associated with an increased risk of developing large breast cancers but to have no effect on drug sensitivity [ 60], indicating that growth rate and drug resistance may be regulated independently.	[]
Taken together, we believe our findings advocate a role for Chk2 in executing cellular response to anthracycline - induced DNA damage.	[]
As mentioned above, removing TP53 mutated tumors including the double - mutated Epi203 from statistical analysis, CHEK2 mutation status still predicted for resistance to anthracycline therapy.	[]
"In addition, removing the tumors harboring the Arg175His mutation from the p53 "" L2 / L3 "" group strengthened the correlation to lack of treatment response to epirubicin ( p = 0. 0005)."	[]
Comparing the effects of mutations in the CHEK2 gene to TP53 mutations indirectly underlines the importance of the role of Chk2 to chemoresistance.	[]
Our present findings as well as results from our previous studies [ 13], [ 14] revealed that about 50% of the patients with tumors harboring TP53 L2 / L3 mutations to be non - responders to primary therapy.	"patients	110	118	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In contrast, all our three patients harboring a non - functional CHEK2 mutation ( the two Arg95Ter mutated patients here and our previous patient harboring the 1368InsA) expressed primary resistance to therapy.	"patients	27	35	Organism/Species"	"patients	27	35	Organism/Species"	"patient	27	34	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We previously hypothesized that therapy response in tumors harboring TP53 L2 / L3 mutations could be due to redundant pathways acting in concert [ 3].	[]
Although no definite conclusion should be drawn from a limited number of observation, the fact that Chk2 not only phosphorylates p53 but also phosphorylates other substrates such as Cdc25A and Cdc25C [ 54] and E2F1 in response to etoposide - induced DNA damage [ 61] may indicate that inactivation of redundant pathways could take place in parallel.	[]
The literature remains inconsistent with respect to whether the border amino acids 163, 195, 236 and 251 should be included in the p53 L2 and L3 domains [ 12].	[]
Taking a conservative approach, we classified patient Epi56, harboring a mutation in codon 163, as a L2 / L3 mutant.	"patient	46	53	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The patient harboring this mutation responded to therapy ( PR).	"patient	4	11	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
If this mutation was classified as outside the L2 domain, our p - value had been strengthened from p = 0. 0136 to p = 0. 0096.	[]
Germline mutations in TP53 cause the Li - Fraumeni and Li - Fraumeni - like cancer disposition syndromes.	[]
However, while the germline and somatic mutations associated with these syndromes reveal a preference for the same codons [ 48], TP53 mutations affecting the DNA - binding domains seem associated with a poor prognosis [ 62], [ 63], [ 64] and, in particular, drug resistance [ 14], [ 40] in breast cancer.	[]
Thus, tumor suppression and tumor cell response to chemotherapeutics may involve different parts of p53 protein function.	[]
Following an initial report identifying a CHEK2 mutation in a family expressing characteristics of the Li - Fraumeni syndrome [ 65], recent evidence has linked CHEK2 founder mutations to a moderately increased risk of breast - and colorectal cancers with some additional disposition for other malignancies as well [ 66].	[]
However, cancer incidence and phenotypes did not reveal an aggressive Li - Fraumeni or Li - Fraumeni - like tumor pattern.	[]
Similar to the two patients in our paclitaxel treatment arm harboring the rare but previously characterized mutation Arg117Gly and the patient with the Ile157Thr mutation, they expressed a moderately increased risk of breast and gastrointestinal cancers ( Fig. 6).	"patients	19	27	Organism/Species"	"patient	19	26	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Thus, CHEK2 resembles TP53 in as much as there seems to be no direct correlation between effects of individual mutations with respect to tumor suppression and drug resistance.	[]
Our finding that TP53 mutations located to the DNA - binding domains predicts drug resistance may indicate transcriptional mechanisms to be involved in drug - induced cell death.	[]
p53 induced apoptosis has been associated with transcriptional induction of genes including Puma and Noxa as well as Bax in experimental systems [ 55], [ 67], [ 68].	[]
Yet, recent evidence has revealed p53 to induce apoptosis through non - transcriptional mechanisms by direct protein interactions with members of the Bcl - 2 / Bax system and mitochondrial release of cytochrom c [ 57], [ 69].	[]
In deed, there is evidence that the DNA - binding domains, in particular the L3 part of the protein, may be critical also to transcriptional - independent apoptosis [ 70].	[]
Of particular note is the finding that Chk2 may regulate transcriptional - independent p53 - mediated apoptosis in response to DNA - damage created through ionizing irradiation [ 71].	[]
Interestingly, Krajewski et al [ 72] reported low expression of Bax assessed by immunostaining to be associated with a low response to chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer.	[]
Although no conclusion should be drawn at this stage, together these findings are consistent with the challenging hypothesis that transcription - independent activation of Bax following Chk2 - phosphorylation may represent a key pathway in p53 dependent cell death in breast cancer in vivo.	[]
p14 acts by releasing p53 from MDM2 binding, and has been related to oncogene - induced p53 activation [ 73].	[]
Recently, p14 was shown to affect p53 by additional mechanisms, including acetylations [ 74], response to ionizing radiation in human fibroblasts [ 75], and tumor - suppression following ionizing radiation in mice [ 76], [ 77].	"human	128	133	Organism/Species"	"mice	209	213	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 209, ""end_span"": 213, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
These findings further links the retinoblastoma and p53 pathways [ 28].	[]
As such, we believe the negative finding with respect to its role in chemoresistance adds important information.	[]
Contrasting earlier findings by us and others [ 15], a recent study revealed TP53 mutations to be associated with increased likelihood of having a complete response to chemotherapy [ 16].	[]
These results may not necessarily be at conflict.	[]
"In the latter study, patients received treatment with a "" dose - dense "" chemotherapy regimen; if confirmed, the combined data may outline a therapeutic indication for aggressive dose - dense therapy based on tumor TP53 / CHEK2 status."	"patients	21	29	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
So far attempts to identify single markers and, more recently, gene expression arrays predicting chemoresistance have not proved successful ( see refs in [ 9], [ 10]).	[]
The findings presented here reveal for the first time defects in a functional gene cascade to be associated with drug resistance in a human cancer in vivo.	"human	134	139	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Moreover, the findings are made in breast cancer, the most frequent malignant disease among women in the industrialized world, and relate to resistance to anthracyclines, the type of cytotoxic compounds most frequently employed for this malignancy.	[]
While the only study we are aware of comparing TP53 mutation status in primaries and their distant metastases suggested an increasing fraction of tumors to express mutated TP53 during progression [ 78], we do not know the potential contribution of either TP53 or CHEK2 mutations to drug resistance in micrometastases or in metastatic disease.	[]
Yet the finding that one of our non - functional CHEK2 mutations associated with chemoresistance ( 1368InsA) occurred as a somatic, not germline mutation, suggest such mutations may be selected for during tumor progression.	[]
We propose the findings presented here provide important beacons identifying a functional pathway [ 3] likely to be disturbed through different mechanisms in relation to therapy resistance in advanced disease.	[]
In conclusion, we believe our findings here that mutations in the TP53 and CHEK2 genes each may cause resistance to anthracycline therapy in primary tumors to have wide implications to future research in this area.	[]
While results from experimental systems are mandatory generating hypotheses, conflicting data from in vitro studies underlines the pivotal role of identifying defects associated with therapy resistance in vivo.	[]
Either through mutations of the genes themselves, or inactivation of this functional cascade through co - factors, we believe identification of the Chk2 - p53 axis as critical to anthracycline therapy response provides a functional clue for further investigations in this area.	[]
Host immunity in the protective response to vaccination with heat - killed Burkholderia mallei	"Burkholderia mallei	75	94	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Burkholderia mallei"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Abstract	[]
Background	[]
We performed initial cell, cytokine and complement depletion studies to investigate the possible role of these effectors in response to vaccination with heat - killed Burkholderia mallei in a susceptible BALB / c mouse model of infection.	"Burkholderia mallei	167	186	Organism/Species"	"mouse	213	218	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Burkholderia mallei"", ""start_span"": 167, ""end_span"": 186, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 213, ""end_span"": 218, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Results	[]
While protection with heat - killed bacilli did not result in sterilizing immunity, limited protection was afforded against an otherwise lethal infection and provided insight into potential host protective mechanisms.	[]
Our results demonstrated that mice depleted of either B cells, TNF - alpha or IFN - gamma exhibited decreased survival rates, indicating a role for these effectors in obtaining partial protection from a lethal challenge by the intraperitoneal route.	"mice	30	34	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Additionally, complement depletion had no effect on immunoglobulin production when compared to non - complement depleted controls infected intranasally.	[]

Background	[]
Burkholderia mallei, the etiologic agent of glanders, is a gram - negative, capsulated, non - motile, facultative intracelluar bacterium.	"Burkholderia mallei	0	19	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Burkholderia mallei"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Most known members of the Burkholderiaceae are resident in the soil; however, B. mallei is thought to be an obligate mammalian pathogen.	[]
Horses are highly susceptible to infection and considered the natural reservoir for infection, although mules and donkeys are also susceptible [ 1].	"Horses	0	6	Organism/Species"	"mules	104	109	Organism/Species"	"donkeys	114	121	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Horses"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 6, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""mules"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""donkeys"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Clinically, glanders in solipeds can present as either a chronic ( horses) or acute ( mules and donkeys) form.	"horses	67	73	Organism/Species"	"mules	86	91	Organism/Species"	"donkeys	96	103	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""horses"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""mules"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""donkeys"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Naturally acquired human infection with B. mallei, although not seen in the United States since 1945, has occurred rarely and sporadically among laboratory workers and those in direct contact with infected animals [ 2].	"human	19	24	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
However, glanders is endemic among domestic animals in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Central and South America.	[]
The course of infection is dependent on the route of exposure.	[]
Direct contact with the skin can lead to a systemic infection.	[]
Inhalation of aerosol or dust containing B. mallei can lead to septicemic, pulmonary, or chronic infections of the muscle, liver and spleen.	[]
The disease has a 95% case fatality rate for untreated septicemic infections and a 50% case fatality rate in antibiotic - treated individuals [ 3].	[]
There is no human or animal vaccine available for glanders, and development of a partial or fully protective adaptive host response to the organism has not been well - defined.	"human	12	17	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Previous studies with B. mallei and the host response have shown that a mixed immune response consisting of both Th1 and Th2 - associated cytokines with a predominant IgG1 subclass does not correlate with protection [ 4].	[]
Additional studies with passive transfer of monoclonal antibodies specific for B. mallei have correlated with early protection from infection [ 5].	[]
Recent studies have also shown the Th1 cytokine IL - 12 to mediate partial protection to non - viable B. mallei - vaccinated mice [ 6].	"mice	125	129	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Thus, full correlates of protection mediated by the adaptive immune system against B. mallei remain to be fully elucidated.	[]
In this series of studies, we sought to address the impact of depletion of the major effector lymphoid cell populations ( B220 + B cells, CD4 + or CD8 + T cells) and key pro - inflammatory / Type 1 cytokines ( IFN - gamma or TNF - alpha) on survival in BALB / c mice vaccinated with heat killed ( HK) bacilli followed by an intraperitoneal ( i. p.) challenge with live organism.	"mice	262	266	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 262, ""end_span"": 266, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In addition, studies investigating the effect of complement on opsonization of organism and antibody production were assessed.	[]
Heat killed bacteria were used as a model of vaccination to allow evaluation of B. mallei specific immune responses.	[]
The results of this study demonstrate participation of B220 + cells and pro - inflammatory cytokines IFN - gamma and TNF - alpha in protection following HK vaccination.	[]
Results	[]
Heat - killed B. mallei vaccination mediates partial protection from lethal challenge	[]
To begin to address this issue in an animal model of acute infection, we established that immunologically naive BALB / c mice challenged i. p. with 2 x 107 CFU resulted in death by day 4 - 6, while i. p. immunization with 1 x 105 heat killed ( HK) bacteria provided partial protection against a subsequent challenge.	"mice	121	125	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Two independent experiments resulted in similar findings of 40% survival for HK - vaccinated mice with a mean survival time ( MST) of 8 days versus 4 days in na i ve mice ( Fig. 1).	"mice	93	97	Organism/Species"	"mice	93	97	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The administration of vaccines for B. mallei during an outbreak would mandate relatively rapid onset of protection for human or veterinary use.	"human	119	124	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Based on non - routine use and vaccine implementation in the course of an outbreak, a 14 day window was chosen for assessment of protection.	[]
Our results indicate that HK vaccination can afford partial protection to an otherwise lethal challenge of B. mallei by the i. p. route.	[]
Effects of cell depletion on HK - vaccinated survival	[]
To dissect the cellular basis for protection mediated by HK vaccination, 13 days after immunization with HK bacteria ( day - 1), and at day of challenge, mice were dosed with antibodies to deplete CD4 +, CD8 + or B220 + cells.	"mice	154	158	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Antibody depletion of CD4 +, CD8 +, or B220 + cells in these mice was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis with depletion efficiencies for CD4, CD8, and B220 populations at 99. 7%, 96%, and 95%, respectively, relative to mice treated with isotype control monoclonal antibodies ( data not shown).	"mice	61	65	Organism/Species"	"mice	61	65	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Our results demonstrated decreased survival rates in B220 ( p = 0. 3418), CD4 + ( p = 0. 5417) and CD8 + ( p = 0. 4684) antibody depleted mice, compared to isotype control antibody, a finding that indicated a possible role for vaccine induced antibody production.	"mice	138	142	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
When challenged with 2 x 107 CFU / mouse by the i. p. route, loss of T cells resulted in reduced survival ( 50%) relative to the non - specific isotype control ( Fig. 2).	"mouse	35	40	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In contrast to the loss of T cells, depletion of B220 + cells resulted in 100% mortality relative to the non - specific isotype control ( Fig. 2).	[]
To further evaluate the necessity of these effector cells in providing protection following HK vaccination, relatively resistant C57BL / 6 mice, deficient in mature B - cells ( mu MT), CD4 T - cells ( CD4 - / -) or CD8 T - cells ( CD8 - / -) were subjected to an identical HK vaccination and challenge regimen.	"mice	139	143	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Mature, B - cell - deficient mice demonstrated a 50% decreased survival ( p = 0. 0888) compared to the wild - type mice with an MST of 35. 5 days ( Fig. 3).	"mice	29	33	Organism/Species"	"mice	29	33	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
CD4 - / - and CD8 - / - mice exhibited a 60% ( p = 0. 1343) and 0% reduced survival, respectively ( Fig. 3).	"mice	24	28	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Effects of cytokine depletion on HK vaccination	[]
Similar studies were performed to determine the role of IFN - gamma or TNF - alpha in acute infection in BALB / c mice immunized with HK bacteria.	"mice	114	118	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Six hours before challenge, mice were dosed with antibodies that neutralize IFN - gamma or TNF - alpha.	"mice	28	32	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Individual depletion of either TNF - alpha ( p = 0. 0145) or IFN - gamma ( p = 0. 0446) resulted in 100% mortality with an MST of 3 and 2 days, respectively, compared to the HK - vaccinated isotype control mice ( Fig. 4).	"mice	206	210	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 206, ""end_span"": 210, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In contrast, 40% of HK - vaccinated, isotype control mice survived to at least 12 days post - challenge ( Fig 4).	"mice	53	57	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
To further evaluate the host TNF - alpha response during an established B. mallei chronic infection, we infected 12 BALB / c mice by the i. p. route with 1 x 106 CFU B. mallei.	"mice	125	129	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
One animal was terminally ill on day 37 post - infection.	[]
On day 42 post - infection, the remaining 11 mice were dosed with either anti - TNF - alpha ( n = 6), or control mAb ( AFRC Mac 49) ( n = 5).	"mice	45	49	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
No further deaths were observed in the control mAb - treated mice.	"mice	61	65	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Rapid mortality was observed in the anti - TNF - alpha - treated group, with all mice dying within 7 days of treatment ( p = 0. 0023) relative to the isotype - treated controls ( Fig. 5).	"mice	81	85	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
J774A. 1 uptake of serum treated B. mallei	[]
Complement mediated uptake assays were performed to evaluate opsonization.	[]
Results indicated enhanced bacterial uptake in J774A. 1 phagocytes inoculated with serum treated B. mallei ( p =. 0082), compared to B. mallei alone, while heat - inactivated serum produced uptake percentages similar to those prior to serum addition ( Fig. 6).	[]
Taken together, these results imply an active role for complement components in the uptake of organism by macrophages.	[]
Immunoglobulin production in HK vaccinated BALB / c mice	"mice	52	56	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We further characterized the ability of HK vaccination to induce a predominant IgG isotype by determining IgG2a / IgG1 ratios in i. p. and i. n. vaccinated BALB / c mice.	"mice	165	169	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 169, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Pre ( day 14 post vaccination) and post ( day 2 post infection) exposure serum samples were obtained and evaluated for IgG isotype concentrations ( Table 1).	[]
No appreciable differences in IgG pre - exposure levels were seen when comparing i. n. to i. p. vaccination.	[]
In addition, cobra venom factor - treated animals showed no significant differences to non - cobra venom factor - treated animals in IgG pre - exposure ( challenge) levels.	[]
Conversely, isotype switching in the cobra venom factor treated animals was enhanced in post - exposure serum IgG2a ( Table 1).	[]
Discussion	[]
Recent studies have shown a key role in protection from lethal challenge for IFN - gamma in non - vaccinated mice from either NK and / or NKT cells following experimental exposure to B. mallei and B. pseudomallei [ 7, 8].	"mice	109	113	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
A similar protective role in the innate response to infection has been demonstrated for TNF - alpha in B. pseudomallei infection [ 8].	[]
The studies presented here are consistent with the essential role of these factors in the relative levels of protection conferred by vaccination with heat - killed B. pseudomallei and would appear to be viable early markers for protection from lethal acute infection [ 9].	[]
Currently, there are no fully protective vaccines against B. mallei or B. pseudomallei in a murine model, particularly for the sensitive BALB / c versus C57BL6 models.	"murine	92	98	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""murine"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Previous studies have also demonstrated that both the humoral and cell - mediated arms are essential for protection from B. pseudomallei infection [ 10].	[]
Thus, loss or reduction of TNF - alpha and IFN - gamma levels result in significantly reduced survival rates, substantiating previous reports of the role of these factors in protection against B. mallei [ 7].	[]
Moreover, we demonstrate a role for sustained TNF - alpha production in the maintenance of host survival throughout the course of B. mallei infection.	[]
Mice with an established B. mallei chronic infection rapidly lost the ability to control the growth of the bacillus upon neutralization of TNF - alpha.	"Mice	0	4	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Mice"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This would suggest a potential role for TNF - alpha in the maintenance of productive granulomas which may limit the spread of bacteria in chronically infected hosts, or, alternatively, in direct or indirect microbicidal or bacteriostatic activities at the sites of infection.	[]
Additional studies are underway to determine more precisely the role of TNF - alpha in host protection to B. mallei.	[]
Multiple innate and adaptive cell types may contribute to the production of IFN - gamma in response to infection with B. mallei following vaccination.	[]
Our results with individual depletion of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells suggests that both cell types may compensate for the functional loss of the other effector cell type in the production of this key cytokine.	[]
The effector role for IFN - gamma in mediating protection against B. mallei may include both immunoregulatory and non - regulatory functions.	[]
Regardless, the requirement of IFN - gamma, as demonstrated by administration of neutralizing antibody prior to infection, indicates that stimulation of IFN - gamma response is a desirable goal for a B. mallei vaccine.	[]
Similarly, B220 - positive cells appear to play a role in protection following vaccination with heat - killed B. mallei.	[]
Interestingly, this protective immunity, occurring in other intracellular pathogens, is not exclusively dependent on B cells [ 11].	[]
Passive protection has been demonstrated against acute Burkholderia infection by monoclonal antibodies [ 5, 12].	[]
Protection against B. pseudomallei infection by anti - LPS, capsular polysaccharide and proteins has been short - lived, suggesting that antibody production offers limited protection in the initial stages of infection by an as - yet - undefined mechanism [ 12].	[]
We have shown that following depletion of B220 + cells, survival rates decreased as much as 100% relative to non - depleted controls and individual CD4 / CD8 - depleted mice via the intraperitoneal route.	"mice	169	173	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Results from C57BL / 6 mice deficient in mature B - cells ( mu MT), CD4 T - cells ( CD4 - / -) or CD8 T - cells ( CD8 - / -) substantiate the requirement for B - cell involvement by evidence of mu MT and CD4 - / - decreased survival.	"mice	23	27	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The lack of an effective CTL response to vaccination did not appear to alter survival in what would appear to be a CD4 / B - cell ( humoral) - driven response.	[]
In CD4 - deficient mice, we have the additional potential variable that a CD4 - dependent antibody response might also be inhibited during the vaccination phase relative to mice treated with antibody immediately prior to and during the early phases of infection.	"mice	19	23	Organism/Species"	"mice	19	23	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Although not statistically significant, we did observe a decrease in survival in mu MT ( mature B cell) deficient mice as early as day 9 post challenge, whereas CD4 - deficient mice produced similar results at day 32 post challenge, indicating a role for B cells independent of CD4 T cell help, perhaps through a T - independent mechanism of antibody production.	"mice	114	118	Organism/Species"	"mice	114	118	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Although CD8 - / - C57BL / 6 demonstrated no decreased survival in our HK - vaccinated model, a lack of potential endogenous protein production by HK B. mallei may have contributed to limited MHC - I presentation.	[]
Complement associated studies revealed increased J774A. 1 uptake of serum - treated B. mallei.	[]
Complement - mediated uptake studies of B. pseudomallei by polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( PMNs) suggest that capsule production contributes to resistance of phagocytosis by reducing C3b bacterial deposition [ 13].	[]
Previous studies have demonstrated that a polysaccharide capsule is present in B. mallei, [ 14, 15] although in the present study enhanced uptake with serum - treated B. mallei was observed.	[]
Intracellular survival assays of complement mediated uptake of organisms were not performed in the present study, thus, the role of complement opsonization on intracellular survival is not fully resolved.	[]
Previous reports have demonstrated the ability of B. mallei to survive within macrophage without the aid of serum coating organisms [ 16].	[]
Conversely, the idea of antibody mediated opsonization to facilitate macrophage activation and clearance of intracellular organisms may offer support to the role of B cells in an effective immune response.	[]
A possible protective mechanism may include HK vaccination induced production of opsonizing antibodies which may aid in complement mediated uptake, thereby limiting the initial bacterial threshold below a lethal level.	[]
Immunoglobulin responses to HK vaccination resulted in modest levels of IgG1 following 2 weeks post vaccination, while post - exposure levels were indicative of efficient class switching to a favorable IgG2a isotype.	[]
Importantly, cobra venom factor treatment of animals at time of vaccination did not alter their ability to produce immunoglobulin.	[]
In fact, cobra venom factor treated animals resulted in higher IgG2a levels when compared to non - treated.	[]
Complement activation can modulate both the primary and secondary immune responses and has been shown to enhance secondary immune responses to vaccination [ 17].	[]
The current results suggest that cobra venom factor treatment may affect the modulation of the immune response to B. mallei infection through B cell activation and / or memory B cell generation.	[]
Conclusion	[]
In summary, our results provide a basis for future studies of protection via vaccination using either subunit or whole - organism vaccine preparations from lethal infection in the experimental BALB / c mouse model.

INTRODUCTION	[]
Enterococcal endocarditis requires special therapeutic considerations because the responsible organisms are relatively penicillin - resistant streptococci which require synergistic combinations of antibiotics to achieve acceptable cure rates [ 1, 2].	[]
The group D enterococci include three main species S. faecalis, S. faecium, and S. durans.	[]
S. faecium cause a minority of all cases of enterococcal endocarditis, in those instances in which enterococci have been speciated [ 3], but they have been more resistant both to penicillin and penicillin - aminoglycoside combinations than S. faecalis [ 4, 5, 6].	[]
We describe a 64 - year - old man with S. faecium endocarditis in whom a six - week course of ampicillin and tobramycin, followed by additional courses of penicillin and other aminoglycosides, failed to eradicate the organism from the patient ' s mitral valve.	"man	30	33	Organism/Species"	"patient	235	242	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""man"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 235, ""end_span"": 242, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This case is of interest because therapeutic failure of ampicillin and tobramycin in S. faecium endocarditis has not been reported previously, but might have been predicted on the basis of previous in vitro and in vivo studies [ 6].	[]
Although the need for both a penicillin derivative and an aminoglycoside in the therapy of enterococcal endocarditis is widely known, it is important to distinguish between the differing efficacies of penicillin - aminoglycoside combinations for treating various species of enterococci such as S. faecium.

CASE REPORT	[]
A 64 - year - old male was in good health until December 1980, when he noted intermittent night sweats, malaise, fever, and fatigue.	[]
He received oral erythromycin for 14 days with transient improvement of symptoms.	[]
However, after completing therapy, symptoms reappeared and he noted a 15 - pound weight loss with low - grade fever ( 99 - 100. 5? F) during the two months preceding admission.	[]
There was no previous history of rheumatic or congenital heart disease.	[]
In March 1981, the patient was admitted to his community hospital where evaluation revealed a new apical systolic murmur radiating to the axilla.	"patient	19	26	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
There were no petechiae, Janeway lesions, Osler ' s nodes, Roth spots, or splenomegaly.	[]
The hematocrit was 34. 8 percent, WBC count 9, 300 cells per cu mm with a differential count of 67 segmented forms, 9 bands, 15 lymphocytes, 7 monocytes, 1 eosinophil, and 1 basophil.	[]
The erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR) was 62 mm per hour ( nl < 10 mm per hour) and the serum rheumatoid factor titer was 1: 320.	[]
Chest films and electrocardiogram were reportedly normal.	[]
Group D streptococci grew from three sets of blood cultures.	[]
Enterococcal endocarditis was diagnosed and he was treated with six weeks of parenteral ampicillin ( 12 grams per day) and tobramycin ( 3 mg per kg per day).	[]
Resolution of symptoms occurred within several days after antibiotics were begun.	[]
Serum bactericidal titers against the organism, obtained during peak antibiotic levels, were 1: 8 or greater on several occasions, and blood cultures were negative while the patient was receiving antibiotics.	"patient	174	181	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 174, ""end_span"": 181, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
M - mode echocardiography demonstrated left atrial enlargement but no definable abnormalities of the mitral or aortic valves.	[]
Intravenous pyelogram, oral cholecystogram, cystoscopy, liver - spleen scan, and upper and lower gastrointestinal series were normal except for a few sigmoid diverticuli.	[]
Flexible signoidoscopy demonstrated both a small perianal fissure and hemorrhoids.	[]
Blood cultures two weeks after therapy were negative.	[]
Second Admission ( June 19 - August 4, 1981)	[]
In June 1981, he again noted intermittent fever, night sweats, and fatigue.	[]
Group D streptococci grew from three sets of blood cultures and he was admitted to the West Haven VA Medical Center for recurrent endocarditis.	[]
On examination a somewhat louder apical systolic murmur was noted.	[]
The ESR was 50 mm / hour and rheumatoid factor titer was 1: 320.	[]
Serum complement levels were normal and cryoglobulins were not detectable.	[]
Chest films, EKG, and urinalysis were normal.	[]
Cardiac M - mode echocardiogram revealed a globular mass attached to the posterior mitral valve leaflet with prolapse into a slightly enlarged left atrium.	[]
A twodimensional echocardiogram confirmed mitral valve prolapse and suggested a posterior leaflet vegetation.	[]
Gallium citrate scan was negative.	[]
Three separate morphologic colony variants were isolated from blood, each identified as S. faecium by Dr. R. R.	[]
Facklam ( Center for Disease Control, Atlanta, Georgia).	[]
The patient received intravenous penicillin ( 20 million units per day) and gentamicin ( 3 mg per kg per day) for six weeks with improvement.	"patient	4	11	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Peak serum bactericidal titers of 1: 8 or greater were achieved against two of the colony variants; however, against the large colony morphotype, a titer of only 1: 2 was obtained.	[]
An enlarged left atrium with intermittent fluttering and prolapse of the mitral valve was noted on echocardiography three weeks into therapy.	[]
Multiple blood cultures taken while the patient was receiving antibiotics were negative, as were those obtained 48 and 72 hours after discontinuation of antibiotics.	"patient	40	47	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

Third Admission ( August 12 - October 4, 1981)	[]

S. faecium ( large colony morphotype, and poorly growing small colony morphotype) grew from six sets of blood cultures obtained on admission.	[]
Penicillin ( 30 million units / day) and gentamicin ( 3 mg / kg / day) were again administered, initially achieving peak serum inhibitory and bactericidal dilutions of 1: 16 and 1: 8 against the organism, respectively.	[]
However, the organism had a lowlevel resistance to streptomycin ( MIC < 125 / Ag / ml), and streptomycin ( 2 grams per day) was substituted for gentamicin two weeks into antibiotic therapy.	[]
Repeat echocardiograms showed irregular and shaggy densities of both mitral valve leaflets with partial prolapse.	[]
Cardiac catheterization demonstrated marked mitral valve prolapse with mitral regurgitation.	[]
A radiolucent filling defect was noted, suggesting a coronary artery embolus at the origin of the left anterior descending ( LAD) artery, causing 75 percent occlusion of the lumen.	[]
The patient underwent mitral valve replacement, receiving a number 31 porcine Hancock bioprosthesis and bypass graft to the midportion of the LAD.	"patient	4	11	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The mitral valve was thickened with several ruptured chordae of the posterior leaflet noted, but no vegetations.	[]
The aortic valve appeared normal, with no visible septal or ring abscesses.	[]
The occlusion in the LAD was not approached to avoid embolizing distal fragments.	[]
Histopathologically the mitral valve showed mild fibrosis and myxoid degeneration without inflammatory changes.	[]
Bacterial and fungal stains were negative but S. faecium grew from fragments of the resected valve.	[]
Following surgery the patient received six additional weeks parenteral penicillin and streptomycin.	"patient	22	29	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

Synergy was readily demonstrable against this organism by penicillin - streptomycin and penicillin - gentamicin combinations in vitro, but not by penicillin - tobramycin.	[]
DISCUSSION	[]
Among streptococci, the enterococci are unusual in their relative resistance to a broad spectrum of antimicrobial agents, and single - agent therapy is rarely bactericidal against them [ 2].	[]
Since Hunter ' s original observations in 1947, it has become increasingly clear that effective synergistic combinations of antibiotics are necessary to successfully treat enterococcal endocarditis [ 1].	[]
Although S. faecalis represents the majority of clinical enterococcal isolates, S. faecium nonetheless comprises 5 - 10 percent of these isolates in some series [ 3, 4].	[]
Moreover, major differences exist in antimicrobial susceptibility and resistance to penicillin - aminoglycoside synergism between these two enterococcal species.	[]
The MIC of penicillin against S. faecium is higher and this organism is more resistant to a number of different combinations of penicillin and various aminoglycosides than is S. faecalis [ 6].	[]
The mechanisms of resistance exhibited by enterococci to penicillin - aminoglycoside synergy have been investigated.	[]
Clinically achievable levels of amino	[]

S.	[]
FAECIUM ENDOCARDITIS	"FAECIUM	0	7	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""FAECIUM"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
glycosides are generally ineffective against enterococci.	[]
This intrinsic low - level resistance ( MIC c 250 isg / ml) is thought to be the result of poor antibiotic penetration of the bacterial cell wall.	[]
However, in the presence of antibiotics that interfere with cell wall synthesis, there is enhanced aminoglycoside uptake [ 7].	[]
In concert, these events are the basis for penicillin - aminoglycoside synergism.	[]
Ribosomal resistance of the 30S subunit to streptomycin and defective uptake of gentamicin in the presence of penicillin have been reported mechanisms of resistance among enterococcal isolates [ 8, 9].	[]
However, in the majority of instances, failure of synergy involves plasmid - mediated production of aminoglycoside - modifying enzymes.	[]
For streptomycin and kanamycin, plasmid - mediated enzymatic inactivation confers high - level resistance ( MIC > 2, 000 Ag / ml) and correlates with failure of these aminoglycosides to exert a synergistic effect when combined with penicillin [ 10, 11].	[]
Plasmid - mediated modifying enzymes have been found in both S. faecalis and S. faecium ' [ 12].	[]
Currently, approximately one - half of clinical enterococcal isolates demonstrate high - level resistance to streptomycin and kanamycin [ 13].	[]
Combinations of penicillin with kanamycin, tobramycin, sisomicin, and netilmicin have consistently failed to demonstrate synergistic killing of S. faecium in vitro [ 6].	[]
This failure of synergy occurs even when high - level resistance to these aminoglycosides is not present.	[]
The mechanism of resistance appears to be related to the production of an inactivating enzyme that acetylates the aminoglycoside substrate at the 6 ' position1 [ 14].	[]
The genetic basis for production of this enzyme has not been well - defined and plasmid transfer experiments have thus far been unsucessful in demonstrating the encodement of this enzyme by extrachromosomal DNA [ 14].	[]
Moellering et al. demonstrated in vivo, utilizing the rabbit model of endocarditis, that penicillin and netilmicin were not efficacious in the treatment of endocarditis caused by a low - level aminoglycoside - resistant strain of S. faecium [ 6].	"rabbit	54	60	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""rabbit"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Although combinations of penicillin with tobramycin, kanamycin, or sisomicin were not evaluated, the authors postulated that the same ineffectual result would have occurred.	[]
In the present case, the recurrence of S. faecium endocarditis after six weeks of therapy with ampicillin and tobramycin confirms the therapeutic and clinical significance of their data, and emphasizes that tobramycin is not an aminoglycoside to be used for treatment of serious S. faecium infections.	[]
Bacterial tolerance has been suggested as a possible basis for therapeutic failures, particularly in the treatment of infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus with defects in the production of autolysins.	"Staphylococcus aureus	139	160	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Staphylococcus aureus"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 160, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
MBCs are generally several - fold higher than MICs and this phenomenon appears to be associated with the autolysin defect [ 5].	[]
Lorian has also described the formation of numerous aberrant cross - walls by S. faecalis grown in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of penicillin [ 15].	[]
MBCs were only slightly higher than MICs for the three S. faecium variants obtained from our patient, and they did not appear to be tolerant strains of S. faecium.	"patient	93	100	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
There was no evidence that any of the morphological variants isolated were unusually resistant to antibiotics.	[]
Therefore, subsequent failure of therapy could not be explained on the basis of antibiotic resistance patterns.	[]
The initial failure of ampicillin and tobramycin therapy may have allowed the infecting organism to become better established and more difficult to eradicate from the valve.	[]

persistent focus of infection causing the LAD lesion seen by arteriography may have slowly resolved and accounted for the apparent failure to respond to synergistic combinations of antibiotics.	[]
In summary, our patient was treated for Streptococcusfaecium endocarditis with both ampicillin and the aminoglycoside antibiotic, tobramycin.	"patient	16	23	Organism/Species"	"Streptococcusfaecium	40	60	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Streptococcusfaecium"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Relapse of endocarditis might have been anticipated on the basis of previous experimental data showing lack of synergy when tobramycin is used against this organism.	[]
This case graphically illustrates the relevance of synergy studies to therapeutic considerations in the treatment of endocarditis.	[]
However, subsequent therapy with synergistic combinations of antibiotics did not result in cure.	[]
The data do not implicate tolerant organisms as a cause for relapses.	[]
Failure of therapy may have been related to the presence of protected organisms in vegetations which were seen on echocardiograms, and also suggested by the presence of a possible coronary artery embolus seen on coronary arteriograms.	[]
In conclusion, speciation of isolates suspected of causing endocarditis and adequate synergy studies of antibiotic combinations are indicated before a long and expensive course of therapy with antimicrobial agents is undertaken for this disease.	[]
However, as this case also illustrates, demonstration of synergism in vitro does not assure clinical cure.	[]

Abstract	[]
A recombinant phage, SpC3, containing a 17 kb genomic DNA insert representing approximately 60% of the 3 ' portion of the sheep collagen alpha 2 gene, was evaluated by electron microscopic R loop analysis.	"sheep	122	127	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""sheep"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
A minimum of 17 intervening sequences ( introns) and 18 alpha 2 coding sequences ( exons) were mapped.	[]
With the exception of the 850 base pair exon located at the extreme 3 ' end of the insert, all exons contained 250 base pairs or less.	[]
The total length of all the exons in SpC3 was 3, 014 base pairs.	[]
The length distribution of the 17 introns ranged from 300 to 1600 base pairs; together, all of the introns comprised 14, 070 base pairs of SpC3 DNA.	[]
Thus, the DNA region required for coding the interspersed 3 kb of alpha 2 collagen genetic information was 5. 6 fold longer than the corresponding alpha 2 mRNA coding sequences. Images	[]

INTRODUCTION	[]
Type I collagen, composed of two al ( I) and one a2 polypeptide chains, is the most abundant of the five known mammalian collagen types.	[]
It is a major extracellular constituent of tissues such as bone, tendon, skin and lung where, because of its great tensile strength, it plays an important	[]
role in tissue structure and function.	[]
The polypeptides comprising type I	[]
collagen are synthesized in long, precursor forms, referred to as pro al ( I) and pro a2 chains, 1 each containing approximately 1500 amino acid residues ( 1).	[]
1 The terminology for the primary translation products of the various	[]
collagen messenger RNAs is still in a state of flux.	[]
It is known that al ( I) and a2 chains are synthesized in precursor forms; these are currently termed pro al ( I) and pro a2 chains ( 1).	[]
However, recent studies ( 43, 44) have shown that the actual primary translation product of al ( I) mRNA is somewhat larger	[]
"than the pro al ( I) chain; this translation product has been termed a "" pre - pro al ( I) chain. "" Although the corresponding "" pre - pro a2 chain "" likely exists, it has not yet been characterized."	[]
For simplicity, therefore, until the	[]
proper terminology for the primary translation product is clarified, we have	[]
"chosen to use the terms "" al ( I) "" and "" a2 "" to refer to the type I collagen mRNAs and collagen structural gene sequences."	[]

Nucleic Acids Research	[]
There is increasing evidence that the quantities of al ( I) and a2	[]
chains produced by cells may be regulated, in part, at the genomic level	[]
( 1).	[]
However, to understand the processes which mediate their expression,	[]
it is necessary to understand the structural organization of these collagen genes and the various enzymes that modify the collagen chains after its	[]
synthesis ( 1).	[]
As an initial approach to this problem, we have recently	[]
isolated a recombinant bacteriophage, termed SpC3, containing approximately 60% of the a2 gene for type I collagen.	[]
Partial characterization of this	[]
a2 gene demonstrated that, like most other structurally evaluated eukaryotic genes, the coding sequences are interspersed with intervening sequences ( 2).	[]
The present study further characterizes this portion of the a2	[]
gene by utilizing electron microscopic R loop analysis to map the coding regions ( exons) and intervening sequences ( introns) contained within the sheep genomic insert of SpC3.	"sheep	148	153	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""sheep"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The data suggests that the structural	[]
organization of this portion of the a2 collagen gene represents 3 kb of coding information that is interspersed in a complex fashion with 17 introns over 17 kb of genome.	[]
MATERIALS AND METHODS	[]
Isolation and characterization of a2 collagen recombinant clone, SpC3.	[]
The sheep a2 collagen recombinant clone, SpC3, containing a portion of the sheep a2 gene, was isolated as previously described ( 2).

Briefly,	[]
high molecular weight fetal sheep liver DNA was extracted by the method of Blin and Stafford ( 3), and 15 - 20 kb DNA fragments, resulting from partial Eco RI digestion, were isolated and ligated to the left and right arms of Charon 4A.	"sheep	28	33	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""sheep"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

genomic library amplified ( 4 - 6).	[]
Screening of the sheep genomic library was	"sheep	17	22	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""sheep"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
conducted utilizing [ 32 P] - labeled fetal sheep tendon type I collagen cDNA and	"sheep	44	49	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""sheep"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
several positive recombinant phages were isolated.	[]
One recombinant, containing a 17 kb sheep genomic insert, was demonstrated to have coding sequences corresponding to 60% of the 3 ' end of a2 mRNA.	"sheep	36	41	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""sheep"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Prior studies showed that the insert in SpC3 was not due to ligation of noncontiguous restriction fragments and / or genetic rearrangement during the cloning process ( 2).	[]
Electron mi croscopy.	[]
To visualize the recombinant bacteriophage DNA structure complementary to a2 collagen mRNA, 1 iig of SpC3 DNA was lyophilized with 1 ig or 100 ng of mRNA	[]
to give DNA: mRNA ratios of 1: 1 and 10: 1, respectively.	[]
These were then dissolved in 10 i1 of R loop buffer [ 70% ( v / v) deionized formamide, 0. 1 N - [ tris ( hydroxy	[]

Two spreading methods were used to subsequently prepare the hybrids for visualization in the electron microscope.	[]
70% formamide method.	[]
Immediately before spreading onto a deionized	[]
water hypophase, the nucleic acid mixtures were diluted an additional 10 - fold in R loop buffer and cytochrome c, 100 vg / ml, was added.	[]
Urea - formamide method.	[]
The nucleic acid solutions were spread using a modification of the method of Westphal and Lai ( 8, 9).	[]
The hyperphase contained 55% formamide, 2. 6 M urea, 0. 009 M EDTA, 0. 09 M tricine - NaOH, pH 8. 0, and the nucleic acid mixture ( approximately 0. 1 to 1. 0 ig / ml).	[]
The mixture was heated at 40? for 30 sec, placed in ice water, and then allowed to reach room temperature.	[]
Cytochrome c, 100 pg / ml, was added immediately before spreading onto a deionized water hypophase.	[]
The nucleic acid - protein films from both methods were absorbed onto	[]
parlodion - coated grids, stained with uranyl acetate ( 10), dehydrated in 90% ethanol and rotary - shadowed with platinum - palladium ( 80: 20) at an angle of 50.	[]
Micrographs were taken with a Siemens Elmiskop 101 electron microscope at an original magnification of 10, 000 and an accelerating voltage of 60 kv.	[]
Nucleic acid lengths were measured at a final magnification of 43, 000 with a	[]
Hewlett - Packard 9810A calculator equipped with a 9864A digitizer using pBR322 and fX - 174 double and single stranded DNA, respectively, as internal length standards.	[]
Approximately 10, 000 hybrid molecules were screened for these studies; approximately 200 represented molecules containing unambiguous regions	[]
appropriate for quantitative analysis.	[]
The mean lengths of each intron and exon were determined for each method and the data expressed as mean?	[]
standard deviation.	[]
Nucleic acid lengths of < 50 base pairs could not be	[]
accurately determined using the methods outlined above.	[]
Thus, in the cases	[]
where introns or exons were of this length or less, accurate error estimates could not be made.	[]

RESULTS	[]
Location and orientation of the intervening and a2 mRNA coding sequences in the SpC3 recombinant DNA.	[]
Hybridization of fetal sheep tendon type I collagen mRNA to SpC3 DNA	"sheep	23	28	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""sheep"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
yielded a complex R loop pattern in the region where the sheep genomic insert was expected to be ligated to the arms of the lambda vector, Charon 4A.	"sheep	57	62	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""sheep"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
To	[]
confirm that these hybridization events were restricted to the inserted sheep DNA fragment, duplex DNA strands on both sides of this hybridization area were measured.	"sheep	72	77	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""sheep"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Using pBR322 as an internal length standard, the left arm of the phage was found to contain 21, 780?	[]
1500 bp, and the right arm, 11, 950?	[]
1030 bp, corresponding to the report values for the left and right arms, respectively, of Charon 4A DNA ( 5, 6).	[]
The hybridization of SpC3 to a2 mRNA resulted in the destabilization of	[]
the inserted helical duplex DNA fragment such that one DNA strand was displaced ( Figure 1).	[]
Occasionally, the displaced DNA strand was mostly absent, probably due to fragmentation induced by accidental mechanical shearing.	[]
This event considerably enhanced the visualization and ordering of the introns.	[]
As the a2 mRNA annealed to complementary DNA regions present in one	[]
DNA strand, numerous single - stranded loops resulted.	[]
These loops, referred to as introns, represented DNA sequences not complementary to the mRNA.	[]
Although, by convention, introns are usually sequentially labeled 5 ' to 3 ', an opposite order had to be employed in this case as SpC3 does not contain the sequences coding for the 5 ' end of sheep a2 mRNA.	"sheep	193	198	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""sheep"", ""start_span"": 193, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Infrequently, all introns	[]
were clearly observed within the same hybrid molecule ( Figure 1).	[]
The largest introns were towards the left arm of Charon 4A and were more clustered than the introns at the opposite end of the hybrid.	[]
Thus, much of the genetic	[]
information coding for the a2 mRNA was contained in that half of the hybrid attached to the right arm.	[]
A small non - hybridized tail was consistently found in the region where	[]
the right arm of the phage was ligated to the sheep genomic insert ( Figure 1).	"sheep	46	51	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""sheep"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This tail likely corresponded to the 3 ' poly A sequence of the a2 mRNA.	[]
At	[]
the extreme 5 ' end of the insert, a variable length was often observed for the remaining unhybridized mRNA strand.	[]
This was most likely due to the size heterogeneity of the a2 mRNA used in these studies.	[]
Size determination and comparative analysis of SpC3 introns.	[]
Although localization of exon and intron sequences was possible with both the 70% formamide and urea - formamide spreading methods, the probability of	[]
detecting unambiguous regions in a hybrid molecule was far greater with the	[]

There was a sharp contrast in the size distribution of the exons and introns contained within SpC3 ( Figure 2).	[]
While the intron sizes varied	[]
considerably, the exons, in general, showed a very narrow distribution of	[]
lengths, and thus tended to cluster at the lowest end of the length distri	[]

The exon in the 800 - 900 bp region was unique and was the only exon which exhibited length overlap with introns.	[]
The maps of the a2 collagen gene obtained with both electron micro	[]
scopic spreading methods were almost identical ( Figure 3), except that the	[]
region at the extreme 5 ' end of the insert could only be mapped with the ureaformamide method.	[]
From these measurements we concluded that the length of the a2 collagen genetic regi? on in SpC3 was 17, 084 bases long with only 3, 014 bases actually coding for a2 mRNA.	[]
Therefore, only 18% of the mapped 17 kb sheep genetic insert actually contained a2 structural information.	"sheep	40	45	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""sheep"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
DISCUSSION	[]
The organizational structure of the a2 collagen gene is complex.	[]
A minimum of 17 introns interrupt the 3 kb of ca2 genetic information interspersed as 18 exons over 17 kb of sheep DNA.	"sheep	109	114	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""sheep"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
"With the exception of exon "" a "" located at the extreme 3 ' end of the inserted a2 gene, all other mapped exons are rather small, exhibiting a size distribution range of 50 to 250 bp."	[]
In	[]
contrast, the intron sizes range from 340 to 1540 bases occupying a total	[]
of 14 kb.	[]
Thus, the DNA region containing the 3 kb of a2 collagen genetic information is 5. 6 fold longer than the corresponding co2 mRNA sequences.	[]
Although the total number of introns present within the 60% 3 ' portion	[]
of the a2 sheep gene was determined to be 17, variation in the precise number	"sheep	10	15	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""sheep"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

of introns present in individual hybrid molecules was observed.	[]
The reason	[]
for this may be due to size heterogeneity of the a2 mRNA used as a complementary probe.	[]
Although the a2 mRNA was extensively purified ( 2), some degradation was likely present.	[]
It is also possible that additional introns exist that are too small to be detected by electron microscopic R loop analysis.	[]
"The most likely a2 genetic regions containing such introns are exons "" g "" and "" m ""."	[]
Small	[]
""" protrusions "" were sometimes observed within these exons that could represent small introns."	[]
Very small introns have been reported for tRNA genes ( 12, 13),	[]
and it will be necessary to sequence these regions of SpC3 to determine if such introns are present within the a2 sheep genome.	"sheep	114	119	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""sheep"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The existence of mRNAs comprised of sequences complementary to noncontiguous regions in a DNA genome was first described for adenovirus ( 14, 15) and	"adenovirus	125	135	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""adenovirus"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
simian virus ( 16, 17) genes.	[]
Similar observations were soon reported for eukaryotic genes, including serum albumin ( 18), conalbumin ( 19), fibroin ( 20), s	[]
globin ( 21, 22), growth hormones ( 23, 24), immunoglobulin ( 25), lysozyme ( 26),	[]
ovalbumin ( 27 - 29), ovomucoid ( 30), rRNA ( 31 - 34), tRNA ( 12, 13), and vitellogenin ( 35).	[]
The precise number or occurrence of introns within these genes does not seem to follow any clear pattern.	[]
However, the genes for albumin, conalbumin,	[]
lysozyme, ovalbumin, and ovomucoid exhibit a structural organization comparable to the a2 collagen gene.	[]
All of these genes are composed of numerous small	[]
exons, usually less than 250 base pairs, and introns which show a large size variation within an individual gene.	[]
Within all of these genomes, the DNA	[]
regions required for coding structural formation are 4 to 7 times longer than the corresponding mRNA coding sequences.	[]
As with the a2 collagen gene, a large unique exon at the extreme 3 ' end	[]
is also present in the ovalbumin gene ( 36, 37).	[]
In the a2 gene, this exon was 800 to 900 nucleotides in length, while in the ovalbumin gene the exon contained 1, 030 base pairs.	[]
Interestingly, this ovalbumin exon contained 634 - 650 base pairs ot DNA sequence to the 3 ' side of the terminator	[]
triplet, suggesting the ovalbumin mRNA has a large untranslated region at the 3 ' end.	[]
The consistent appearance of a small non - hybridized tail, approximately 100 nucleotides in length, in the region where the right arm of the phage was ligated to the sheep genomic insert of SpC3 very likely corresponded to the	"sheep	167	172	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""sheep"", ""start_span"": 167, ""end_span"": 172, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
3 ' poly A sequence of the a2 mRNA.	[]
This would suggest that the a2 mRNA coding sequence terminates very near or at this point in the genome.	[]
Previously published biochemical evidence ( 2) obtained from restriction mapping and Southern blot analysis using [ 32P] - labeled chick a2 cDNA probe supports	[]
2250	[]
Nucleic Acids Research	[]
this observation.	[]
It is unclear what role introns play in genetic expression.	[]
However,	[]
it is known that these sequences are tranncribed as part of larger precursor mRNAs and the introns are then excised and the fragmented mRNA chains	[]
covalently rejoined ( 38).	[]
Some evidence has recently accumulated demonstrating the existence of precursor a2 mRNAs ( 39, 40).	[]
However, if the introns in the a2 gene are transcribed in their entirety, as has been	[]
demonstrated for the introns in ovalbumin and globin ( 41, 42), much larger precursor a2 mRNAs may exist than those reported to date.	[]
For if the re	[]
mainder of the a2 collagen gene has a structural organization comparable to the 60% 3 ' portion that has been analyzed, it is probable that the a2	[]
collagen gene in its entirety is dispersed throughout a 30 kb DNA segment.	[]

Thumb force deficit after lower median nerve block	[]
Abstract	[]
Purpose	[]
The purpose of this study was to characterize thumb motor dysfunction resulting from simulated lower median nerve lesions at the wrist.	[]
Methods	[]
Bupivacaine hydrochloride was injected into the carpal tunnel of six healthy subjects to locally anesthetize the median nerve.	[]
Motor function was subsequently evaluated by measuring maximal force production in all directions within the transverse plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the thumb.	[]
Force envelopes were constructed using these measured multidirectional forces.	[]
Results	[]
Blockage of the median nerve resulted in decreased force magnitudes and thus smaller force envelopes.	[]
The average force decrease around the force envelope was 27. 9%.	[]
A maximum decrease of 42. 4% occurred in a direction combining abduction and slight flexion, while a minimum decrease of 10. 5% occurred in a direction combining adduction and slight flexion.	[]
Relative decreases in adduction, extension, abduction, and flexion were 17. 3%, 21. 2%, 41. 2% and 33. 5%, respectively.	[]
Areas enclosed by pre - and post - block force envelopes were 20628 + / - 7747 N. N, and 10700 + / - 4474 N. N, respectively, representing an average decrease of 48. 1%.	[]
Relative decreases in the adduction, extension, abduction, and flexion quadrant areas were 31. 5%, 42. 3%, 60. 9%, and 52. 3%, respectively.	[]
Conclusion	[]
Lower median nerve lesion, simulated by a nerve block at the wrist, compromise normal motor function of the thumb.	[]
A median nerve block results in force deficits in all directions, with the most severe impairment in abduction and flexion.	[]
From our results, such a means of motor function assessment can potentially be applied to functionally evaluate peripheral neuropathies.	[]
Introduction	[]
The thumb has unique anatomical and biomechanical characteristics that are required to perform many manipulative tasks.	[]
Thumb motor dysfunction resulting from neuromuscular and musculoskeletal pathologies severely hinders the performance of these daily tasks.	[]
Clinical treatment, prevention protocols, and rehabilitation efficacy requires a thorough understanding of thumb motor capabilities, as well as its associated functional deficit.	[]
Investigations of underlying pathological mechanism of the thumb help advance clinical treatments such as tendon transfers [ 1], functional electrical stimulation [ 2] and plasticity suppression [ 3].	[]
Measurement of strength during maximum voluntary contraction is a simple and direct means of assessing neuromuscular function.	[]
Popular instruments used for quantitative assessment of thumb strength are pinch dynamometers.	[]
The pinch output, however, provides limited information about thumb motor function in that it offers a single generic force in one specific direction.	[]
Each muscle / tendon within the thumb has a distinct anatomical origin and insertion, suggesting its external force potential in a particular direction [ 4 - 6].	[]
Hence, evaluation of strengths in multiple directions offers insight concerning the motor capacity of individual muscles.	[]
Force production of a digit has been measured in various directions such as flexion / extension [ 7, 8], abduction / adduction [ 9 - 14], or in combined directions [ 15, 16].	[]
Bourbonnais et al. developed an apparatus to measure thumb force production in eight directions in the transverse plane of the thumb and investigated force dependence on the direction of effort [ 15].	[]
Yokogawa and Hara measured index fingertip forces in various directions within the flexion / extension plane [ 8].	[]
Recently, we developed experimental apparatuses to measure multi - directional forces of a digit in its transverse plane [ 17 - 19].	[]
From these multi - directional forces we constructed force envelopes representative of the characteristic force output pattern of a digit [ 17 - 19].	[]
Disorders resulting from traumatic injuries to and various diseases of these nerves are common in clinical practice.	[]
Clinical manifestations of hand dysfunction are distinctive depending on the nerve involved.	[]
For example, thenar atrophy is a major clinical observation affecting thumb function at the later stages of compression neuropathy of the median nerve.	[]
Several studies have been conducted to investigate the effects of simulated peripheral neuropathies using local anesthetization [ 5, 16, 20, 21].	[]
Kozin et al.	[]
[ 21] studied the effects of median and ulnar nerve blocks on grip and pinch strength and showed significant decreases following nerve blockage [ 21].	[]
Boatright and Kiebzak [ 20] investigated the effects of median nerve block on thumb abduction strength.	[]
Kaufman et al.	[]
[ 5] measured isometric thumb forces in eight directions together with electromyographic signals of thumb muscles after block of the median nerve.	[]
Labosky and Waggy [ 22] studied the strength related to grip, pinch, thumb adduction, thumb abduction, and finger flexion after radial nerve block [ 22].	[]
Kuxhaus studied the three dimensional feasible force set at the thumb - tip before and after ulnar nerve block and reported this to be a reproducible and sensitive means to detect impairment.	[]
The purpose of this study was to utilize our developed apparatus and protocols to investigate the effects of lower median nerve lesion on thumb motor function.	[]
The lesion was simulated by blocking the median nerve at the wrist using an anesthetic.	[]
We hypothesized that a median nerve block would cause ( 1) a decrease in force production, which would be direction - dependent with the most severe reduction in the abduction direction, and ( 2) a decrease in the force envelope area and force quadrant area, with the greatest decrease in the abduction quadrant.	[]
Methods	[]
Subjects	[]
Six healthy male subjects ( mean age: 26. 9 + / - 5. 1 years) participated in this study.	[]
The subjects had no previous history of neuromuscular or musculoskeletal disorders of the upper extremities.	[]
Each subject signed an informed consent form approved by the Institutional Review Board prior to participating in the experiment.	[]
Median nerve block	[]
Injections were performed under aseptic conditions while the subjects sat with the forearm supinated and the wrist slightly extended.	[]
After the skin at the palmer area of the wrist was cleaned with alcohol, 4 mL of 0. 5% bupivacaine hydrochloride ( Astra Pharmaceuticals, Westborough, MA, USA) was injected into the carpal tunnel with a sterile 25 - gauge short - bevel needle.	[]
The needle was inserted through the transverse carpal ligament in line with the radial border of the fourth digit slightly ulnar to the palmaris longus tendon at the level of the distal wrist crease.	[]
Forty minutes was allowed for the median nerve block to reach complete effectiveness [ 23] and was verified using the Semmes - Weinstein monofilament test.	[]
The average monofilament score was 2. 85 across the five digits before nerve block.	[]
About 40 minutes after nerve injection, little sensory impairment occurred in the ulnar distribution ( score = 3. 22), while the sensory score in the median distribution was greater than 6. 15.	[]
The effects of nerve block lasted more than 6 hours with all subjects regaining normal hand function within 12 hours.	[]
Testing apparatus	[]
The experimental apparatus was designed and constructed to measure maximum voluntary contraction forces of any digit at any point along the digit.	[]
Force application was possible in any direction within the transverse plane of the longitudinal axis of the digit.	[]
The apparatus consisted of position control accessories, a force transducer, and a custom fitted aluminum ring attached to the transducer ( Figure 1A, 1B).	[]
The transducer ( Mini40, ATI Industrial Automation, NC, USA), capable of measuring 6 degrees of freedom forces and moments, was attached to a mounting clamp via an aluminum adapter plate while the aluminum ring was secured to the tool side of the transducer using a custom adapter.	[]
The ring served as a connection anchor for the transducer and the digit.	[]
The force transducer and ring attachment were positioned in a desired orientation using an aluminum slide rail, tubing, and lockable mounting clamps ( 80 / 20 Inc., Columbia City, IN, USA).	[]
The slide rail was secured to an aluminum base plate.	[]
Foam padded wooden blocks with two locking straps secured the arm to the base plate.	[]
The analog outputs from the transducer were digitized using a 16 - bit analog - to - digital converter ( PCI - 6031, National Instruments, TX, USA).	[]
The X ( abduction / adduction) and Y ( flexion / extension) force components in the transverse plane were displayed on the screen while the subject performed a force production task.	[]
The resolutions of the force transducer in its axial ( flexion / extension) and horizontal ( abduction / adduction) directions were 0. 16 N and 0. 08 N, respectively.	[]
A personal computer equipped with LabVIEW ( National Instrument, TX, USA) was used for force data acquisition, display, and processing.	[]
Experimental procedures	[]
Each subject was tested before and after median nerve block.	[]
The nerve block procedures were performed immediately after the completion of the first testing session.	[]
Post - block testing started after the verification of complete median nerve block, approximately 40 minutes after the injection.	[]
During each test, the subject was seated in a chair adjacent to the testing station modified with a wooden board to align their back vertically throughout the trials.	[]
The subjects rested their forearm on padded wooden blocks positioning their shoulder in approximately 60 degrees of frontal plane abduction.	[]
Nylon straps fitted with plastic snap locking mechanisms secured the forearm and minimized the intervention of the elbow and shoulder during thumb force application.	[]
Subjects grasped a vertical dowel secured to the distal end of the wooden blocks in a midprone position.	[]
Formable thermoplastic braces were used to fix the elbow in 90 degrees of flexion, and the wrist in 20 degrees of extension and 0 degrees of ulnar deviation.	[]
A metallic brace was used to fix the interphalangeal joint of the thumb in full extension.	[]
The aluminum ring was placed around the middle of the proximal phalanx and oriented to accommodate comfortable thumb position with the metacarpophalangeal joint flexed approximately 15 degrees.	[]
Prior to testing, a line was drawn on the proximal phalange at the midpoint between the interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints.	[]
The alignment of the ring with the circumferential line standardized the location of force application within and between subjects.	[]
As force application was at the middle of the proximal phalanx, mechanical action pertains to both the metacarpophalangeal and carpometacarpal joints.	[]
We chose the terminology of flexion / extension and adduction / adduction based on the mechanical action with respect to the metacarpophalangeal joint.	[]
With the thumb in the ring ( Figure 1B), extension and flexion occurred in parallel with the palm, and abduction and adduction occurred in a plane perpendicular to the palm.	[]
Each subject performed 15 circumferential MVC trials with randomized starting directions ( Figure 1C).	[]
The subject was allotted 15 seconds to complete each circumferential trial, and was instructed to use the entire time allotted to traverse the perimeter of the ring once.	[]
A dot generated on the computer screen was programmed to traverse a circle within 15 seconds to provide the subject with directional feedback of their force application.	[]
Subjects were given 60 seconds of rest between each circumferential trial.	[]
Each subject was familiarized with the task with a few practice trials.	[]
Data were collected from each subject at 100 samples per second producing a total of 22, 500 pairs of force components from the 15 circumferential trials.	[]
Our previous study [ 19] indicated that the testing protocol did not cause noticeable fatigue.	[]
Force envelope and quadrants	[]
Data from multiple circumferential trials were accumulated to construct a force envelope.	[]
The procedures to generate a force envelope were as follows:	[]
Cartesian force coordinates ( Xi, Yi) were transformed into polar coordinates ( R alpha, alpha), where R alpha was the force magnitude at an angular position alpha.	[]
Each alpha was rounded to the nearest integer ranging from 0 to 359 degrees.	[]
The maximum, F alpha, was determined from a string of N data points along each radial line defined by alpha.	[]
At the completion of the 15 trials, there were, on average, N = 63 data points on each radial line of alpha based on the distribution off the 22, 500 data points around 360 degrees.	[]
A moving average with an interval of 10 degrees was applied to the maximal series data F alpha ( alpha = 0, 1, 2,..., 359) to obtain filtered maximal forces.	[]
These forces formed a force envelope.	[]
The area formed by a force envelope was divided into adduction - extension, extension - abduction, abduction - flexion, and flexion - adduction quadrants by radial lines oriented at 0 degrees, 90 degrees, 180 degrees, and 270 degrees A quadrant force was represented using the mean magnitude of the forces in that quadrant.	[]
The areas of the entire envelope and each quadrant were calculated by summing the areas of individual arc sections formed by the polar coordinates of the force envelope.	[]
( Figure 2).	[]
Statistical Analyses	[]
One - and two - factor repeated measures analyses of variance ( ANOVA) were used to analyze outcome measures.	[]
The independent variables were testing SESSION ( n = 2, i. e., pre - and post - block), force DIRECTION ( n = 16), and force QUADRANT ( n = 4), with SESSION as a repeated variable.	[]
Dependent variables were directional force, individual quadrant area and force envelope area.	[]
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 11 ( SPSS Inc., Illinois) with statistical significance set at alpha = 0. 05.	[]
Results	[]
Force envelope and directional forces	[]
Figure 3 shows the force envelopes produced by each subject ( A to F) before and after median nerve block.	[]
The post - block force envelope was inside the pre - block envelope for each subject, indicating a decrease in force magnitude in all directions after nerve block.	[]
Figure 4 shows the average pre - and post - block force envelope across all subjects.	[]
Force magnitudes were significantly reduced after nerve block ( p < 0. 001) resulting in significantly smaller force envelopes.	[]
The average decrease across all directions was 27. 9%.	[]
A maximum decrease of 42. 4% occurred at 199 degrees, corresponding to a combined direction of abduction and slight flexion, while a minimum decrease of 10. 5% occurred at 328 degrees corresponding to a combined direction of adduction and slight flexion.	[]
Relative decreases at 0 degrees ( adduction), 90 degrees ( extension), 180 degrees ( abduction), and 270 degrees ( flexion) directions were 17. 3%, 21. 2%, 41. 2% and 33. 5%, respectively.	[]
A single force in each quadrant was represented using the mean magnitude of the forces in that quadrant ( see description in the Methods).	[]
The average quadrant forces were significantly decreased after nerve block ( p < 0. 001; Figure 5).	[]
The amount of decrease was also different between quadrants ( p < 0. 005).	[]
Relative decreases in mean quadrant forces were 24. 5%, 38. 7%, 32. 1%, and 18. 1% for extension, abduction, flexion, and adduction, respectively.	[]
The maximal decreases in mean quadrant force, 38. 7%, occurred in the abduction quadrant.	[]
Force envelope areas and quadrant areas	[]
Areas enclosed by the post - block envelopes were significantly smaller than the pre - block envelopes ( p < 0. 001; Figure 4).	[]
Post - block force envelope area, 10700 + / - 4474 N. N, was 51. 9% of pre - block force envelope area, 20628 + / - 7747 N. N.	[]
Quadrant area decreased significantly ( p < 0. 001; Figure 6).	[]
The maximal percentage decrease in area after nerve block was 60. 9% in the abduction quadrant, followed by a 52. 3% area decrease in the flexion quadrant.	[]
Discussion	[]
In this study we simulated a lower median nerve lesion and evaluated the resultant thumb motor function deficit.	[]
Our internal control via pre - and post - block design offered a particular advantage of investigating the mechanical role of muscles innervated by a targeted nerve.	[]
The testing and analytical methods employed have provided advanced quantification of thumb motor function.	[]
The results have confirmed our initial hypotheses that greatest force decreases occurred in directions related to abduction, and that the post - block thumb force envelope area was smaller than the pre - block force envelope area.	[]
Preferential force attenuation in the quadrants of abduction and flexion after median nerve block are in agreement with anatomical and neuromuscular features of the thumb.	[]
The median nerve innervates the abductor pollicis brevis, the opponens pollicis and superficial head of the flexor pollicis brevis, all of which contribute to the abduction and flexion of the thumb [ 4]; therefore, denervation of these muscles after median nerve block would cause the greatest force deficit related to median nerve function [ 5].	[]
Additionally, as force application moved towards adduction, the force deficit decreased as neuromuscular control shifted from the median nerve to the ulnar nerve via the first dorsal interosseous and adductor pollicis brevis.	[]
Force deficit in extension was also comparably small as extension forces are mainly produced by the extensors pollicis brevis and longus originating in the forearm.	[]
Our reported force decreases following a median nerve block ( 40. 9% in abduction, 34. 1% in flexion) were smaller than those reported in the literature.	[]
Kozin et al.	[]
[ 21] reported a 60% decrease in pinch strength after a median nerve block using mepivicaine hydrochloride [ 21].	[]
Boatright and Kiebzak [ 20] reported an approximate 70% decrease in thumb abduction strength after median nerve block using Lidocaine [ 20].	[]
Kaufman et al.	[]
[ 5] stated that a median nerve block with Lidocaine almost completely diminished force production in the abduction direction [ 5].	[]
The discrepancy may be due to the anesthetic used and strength testing method.	[]
Although the sensory block appeared to be complete for each method, the motor capabilities of the muscles associated with the median nerve might or might not be completely eliminated.	[]
Such a result is largely dependent on a particular anesthetic, its concentration and dosage, as well as the efficacy of the injection technique at immersing the nerve.	[]
The methods of strength testing may also help explain the different magnitudes of strength deficit after the nerve block.	[]
All previous results were based on forces obtained in discrete direction ( s), and focused exertions, while the current study utilized a method of force production in a continuous, circumferential and dynamic manner.	[]
Furthermore, thumb motor performance can be maintained despite the absence of certain individual muscles.	[]
For example, Britto and Elliot reported that the loss of abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis in their two patients did not show functional compromise of strength and grip strength [ 24].	"patients	124	132	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
"In a broader sense, the neuromuscular system has remarkable capabilities to accomplish the same motor function goal using different effectors and different goals using the same effectors, a phenomenon so called "" motor equivalence "" [ 25]."	[]
An unexpected finding from this study was that the force deficit occurred in all directions ( Figure 4).	[]
In other words, the median nerve block caused reduced force production by those muscles not associated with the median nerve.	[]
Several potential explanations exist to describe such a phenomenon.	[]
First, the injection into the carpal tunnel at the wrist, although localized, potentially diffused into the intrinsic fascia of the hand partially compromising function of the ulnar nerve, which innervates the adductor pollicis.	[]
Although Semmes - Weinstein monofilament testing confirmed the continued sensation of the digits within the ulnar nerve distribution, it is not inconceivable that the injection could have contaminated the ulnar innervated muscles, the first dorsal interosseous and deep head of the flexor pollicis brevis [ 20].	[]
Secondly, thumb force in any direction is produced by synergistic activation of the many intrinsic muscles, and as a result, the muscular deficiency associated with one direction may hinder the force production in other directions by other muscles [ 5, 22].	[]
For example, Kaufman et al. demonstrated that thumb muscles not innervated by the median nerve displayed lower electromyographical activation and shifted the direction of maximum activation after a median nerve block [ 5].	[]
Labosky and Waggy showed that a radial nerve block caused a 53% decrease in thumb abduction strength because of the lack of stabilization of the radial innervated extensor muscles [ 22].	[]
Consequently, deficiency of median innervated muscles inherently limits force production in other directions as neuromuscular switching is necessary to produce force in changing directions.	[]
The median innervated muscles are the dominant abductors of the thumb metacarpophalangeal and carpometacarpal joint.	[]
The more than 50% residual abduction force found in this study suggests that the injection did not totally block the motor function of these muscles, even though a complete sensory loss was verified.	[]
This concurs with clinical observations of median compression neuropathy.	[]
Individuals with carpal tunnel syndrome complain of sensory dysfunction early in the disease process ( at the beginning), while motor signs of thenar wasting and thumb weakness occur as the disease advances.	[]
The concept that the motor deficit is more resistant to peripheral median neuropathy than sensory loss has been well documented [ 23, 26, 27].	[]
Butterworth et al. studied the temporal effects on sensory and motor blockade after injection of bupivacaine or mepivacaine, and found that sensory loss was complete but about a 20% compound motor action potential remained after 40 minutes [ 23].	[]
In conclusion, we have incorporated a method for assessing thumb motor deficit based on strength measurement with a standard local anesthetic to investigate the effects of a simulated median neuropathy on thumb motor function.	[]
Median nerve block results in force deficits in all directions, with the most severe impairment in abduction and flexion.	[]
Future endeavors using this methodology can potentially further elucidate underlying pathomechanisms of peripheral neuropathies in all digits of the hand.	[]
