To test whether wheat mitochondria are able to edit a cognate site when placed in the context of a potato transcript, we introduced the C259 - 16 / + 6 region from wheat cox2 into potato rps10 exon 1 or intron ( Figure 6A, construct MA and ME6, respectively).

Muc1 knockout mice ( Muc1 - / -; MUC1 is human; Muc1 is mouse) show a reduction in tumorigenic phenotype when crossed onto mice overexpressing the Wnt - 1 [ 7] or polyomavirus middle T antigen [ 8] oncogenes in the mammary gland.

Antibodies used for analysis of surface markers included: FITC - conjugated rat anti - mouse CD45R / B220 ( RA3 - 6B2, BD Pharmingen San Diego, CA) for B cells; FITC - conjugated rat anti - mouse CD8 alpha ( 53 - 6. 7) and CD4 ( GK1. 5, BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) for CD8 + or CD4 + cells, respectively.
