In both normolipemic and hyperlipemic men and women serum leptin correlated significantly with insulin resistance, while HDL - cholesterol correlated inversely with HOMA - IR only in women ( both normo - and hyperlipemic), and serum tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF alpha) only in hyperlipemic women.

Generally, the insulin resistance ( represented by HOMA IR) was in men much less influenced by metabolic variables than in women; while in women in some combinations of dependent variables R2 reached 64%, in men the maximal value of R2 was only 39%.
