Although this type of expansion is unusual in this gene family, it is actually not unique; similar expansion has occurred in bovine species, with gene duplication resulting in the three closely - related bovine pancreatic, bovine brain ( 19, 20) and bovine seminal ( 21) ribonucleases.

Arbitrary assignment of the 95th percentile values for full - length BLyS and Delta BLyS mRNA levels among the normal control individuals as the upper limits of ' normal ' revealed that two of the 30 normal control individuals, four of the 60 RA patients, and 20 of the 60 SLE patients had elevated full - length BLyS mRNA levels ( P < 0. 001), and that two of the 30 normal control individuals, three of the 60 RA patients, and 19 of the 60 SLE patients had elevated Delta BLyS mRNA levels ( P < 0. 001).

Fungi and oomycetes are responsible for many of the world ' s most devastating plant diseases including late blight disease of potato, caused by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans and rice blast disease caused by the ascomycete fungus Magnaporthe grisea, both of which are responsible for very significant harvest losses each year.
