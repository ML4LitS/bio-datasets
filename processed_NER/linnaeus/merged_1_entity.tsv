The results with FMDV clones H5 have documented that both fitness - enhancing and virulence - enhancing mutations can be incorporated in the viral genome in such a fashion that subsequent fitness - decreasing mutations associated with bottleneck ( plaque - to - plaque) transfers produce only minimal effects on virulence ( Figure 2).

This model is reinforced by the observation that three amino acid substitutions in 2C ( S80N, T256A, and Q263H) had a similar effect in enhancing FMDV virulence, and the three mutations in the same genome had an effect comparable to each mutation individually ( Figure 6; Tables 2 and S1).

We propose that a higher robustness of the FMDV genome with regard to virulence for BHK - 21 cells, rather than to replicative fitness in the same cells, underlies the different trajectories followed by fitness and virulence upon subjecting the virus to repeated bottleneck transfers.

The comparative analysis of FMDV clones and populations shows that shifts in virulence can occur even through the evolution of a single viral clone ( C - S8c1), with its restricted genetic diversity prompted by different replication regimes in the same host cells, which also have a clonal origin ( see Materials and Methods).

However, the observation of a lack of correlation between fitness and virulence in a FMDV clone is relevant to current models of attenuation and virulence, since it shows that more virulent forms of a virus need not have a reproductive advantage, and that viral virulence is not necessarily a byproduct of viral fitness.

However, in hyperlipemic women the significance of this correlation lessened, because HOMA IR increased considerably ( and significantly) but serum concentration of leptin only slightly ( insignificantly).	women,25,30,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""women"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	test

On the basis of the presence of shared clinical features of RA ( mainly erosive arthritis) and SLE ( including renal and neurological involvement) along with the presence of anti - dsDNA and anti - CCP autoantibodies in our patients with rhupus, our findings strongly support the contention that rhupus is a true overlap between RA and SLE, not merely a part of the clinical spectrum of the articular involvement seen in SLE.	patients,224,232,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 224, ""end_span"": 232, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	test

The expected appearance of the upperwing of Pileated Woodpecker - mostly black with a small white patch at the base of the primaries - is often not seen, and is only clearly resolvable when birds are flying near - vertically before landing on a tree trunk; something the bird in the Luneau video did not do.

It is argued in this paper that, in fact, the black trailing edge of the wing of a Pileated Woodpecker is seen clearly in the Luneau video, during the downstroke of the wingbeat cycle, but that it has been misinterpreted as black wingtips ( Figure 1, 2, 3).

Notwithstanding that certain frames of the Luneau video ( e. g. frame 350) do appear to show a black trailing edge to the upperwing, data presented in this paper shows that, at this angle of view and resolution of video, Pileated Woodpeckers also may fail to show this feature.

The fact that in only four recorded escape flights of Pileated Woodpecker, two were recorded for which the initial escape flight wingbeat frequency ( 8. 0 s - 1 and 8. 6 s - 1) exceeded that previously recorded for this species shows that previous datasets were too limited to make this conclusion.

The results with FMDV clones H5 have documented that both fitness - enhancing and virulence - enhancing mutations can be incorporated in the viral genome in such a fashion that subsequent fitness - decreasing mutations associated with bottleneck ( plaque - to - plaque) transfers produce only minimal effects on virulence ( Figure 2).

This model is reinforced by the observation that three amino acid substitutions in 2C ( S80N, T256A, and Q263H) had a similar effect in enhancing FMDV virulence, and the three mutations in the same genome had an effect comparable to each mutation individually ( Figure 6; Tables 2 and S1).

The comparative analysis of FMDV clones and populations shows that shifts in virulence can occur even through the evolution of a single viral clone ( C - S8c1), with its restricted genetic diversity prompted by different replication regimes in the same host cells, which also have a clonal origin ( see Materials and Methods).

However, the observation of a lack of correlation between fitness and virulence in a FMDV clone is relevant to current models of attenuation and virulence, since it shows that more virulent forms of a virus need not have a reproductive advantage, and that viral virulence is not necessarily a byproduct of viral fitness.

Apart from this, an intriguing possibility is that the brain - specific isoform, MT - III, might contribute to the results we obtained because the expression of MT - III, together with MT - I, is increased in the brain of old rats, resulting in the low availability of free zinc for synapses ( Mocchegiani et al. 2004).	rats,226,230,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""rats"", ""start_span"": 226, ""end_span"": 230, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	train
