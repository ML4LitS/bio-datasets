However, the lack of crossed recognition of cox2 promoters in wheat and potato is not a general situation since the A. thaliana cox2 gene is expressed and spliced when introduced into maize mitochondria, indicating that the Arabidopsis gene shares some signals with maize cox2 promoter that are sufficient for transcription ( 18).
