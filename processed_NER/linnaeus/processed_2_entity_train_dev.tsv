Scp160p is a 160 kDa protein in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that contains 14 repeats of the hnRNP K - homology ( KH) domain, and demonstrates significant sequence homology to a family of proteins collectively known as vigilins.

Drosophila Kc cells were routinely cultured at 25 degrees C in Schneider Drosophila medium ( GIBCO) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 160 mu g / ml penicillin, 250 mu g / ml streptomycin, and 4 mM l - glutamine.

To verify whether SSc patients might display a prothrombotic condition, plasma D - dimer was assessed in 28 consecutive SSc patients and in 33 control subjects, matched for age, sex and environmental habit.

After stratifying SSc patients according to disease subset, no significant differences were observed between those with limited cutaneous pattern and controls, whereas patients with diffuse cutaneous pattern displayed substantially increased values.

We demonstrated that SSc patients with diffuse subset are characterized by increased plasma D - dimer values, reflecting a potential activation of both the hemostatic and fibrinolytic cascades, which might finally predispose these patients to thrombotic complications.

Therefore, to investigate whether SSc patients might be characterized by a potential prothrombotic condition, plasma D - dimer vales were measured in a subset of SSc patients, compared with those of a healthy matched control population and further associated with SSc disease subset.

After stratifying SSc patients according to disease subset, no significant differences were observed between those with limited cutaneous pattern ( lcSSc) and controls ( geometric mean plasma D - dimer: 283 ng / mL, IC95%: 282 - 285 ng / mL; p = 0. 61), whereas patients with diffuse cutaneous pattern ( dcSSc) displayed substantially increased values ( geometric mean plasma D - dimer: 538 ng / mL, IC95%: 536 - 539 ng / mL; p < 0. 001).

Additionally, patients with active disease, as evaluated according to the European Scleroderma Study Group criteria [ 7], displayed higher D - dimer levels as compared to patients with inactive disease ( p = 0. 027).

The significant correlation observed with disease activity, cutaneous involvement and forced vital capacity, further suggests that SSc patients, especially those with diffuse subset, display a hypercoagulable state, which might finally predispose this peculiar subset of patients to the development of thrombotic complications.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, each rRNA gene is transcribed by RNA polymerase I into a 35S rRNA precursor, consisting of 18S, 5. 8S and 25S rRNA sequences flanked by two external transcribed spacers ( ETS) and separated by two internal transcribed spacers ( ITS) ( Fig. 1).

Murine eosinophil - associated ribonucleases - 1 and - 2 ( mEAR - 1 and mEAR - 2) are the predicted amino acid sequences from two genes described previously by Larson and colleagues ( 15); murine ribonucleases 3, 4, 5 and 6 - pseudogene ( mR - 3, mR - 4, mR - 5 and mR - 6P), are the predicted amino acid sequences encoded by novel DNA	"Murine	0	6	Organism/Species"	"murine	189	195	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Murine"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 6, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""murine"", ""start_span"": 189, ""end_span"": 195, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The six genes within this cluster have varying amino acid sequence homologies to one another, but are clearly more closely related to one another than to either murine pancreatic ribonuclease ( mPR) or angiogenin ( mANG), or to any of the human ribonucleases of the RNase A family.

Although the amino acid sequences encoded by mEAR - 1 and mEAR - 2 match those of tryptic peptides derived from murine eosinophil proteins ( 15), the homology data do not stand in overwhelming support of a unique relationship between any of the mR cluster ribonucleases and the human eosinophil ribonucleases EDN and ECP.

On this point, a number of studies have suggested a distinct role for the human ribonuclease ECP in eosinophil - mediated host defense ( 6, 7); in addition, we have recently shown that eosinophil ribonucleases can inhibit retroviral transduction of human target cells ( 23).

Considerable evidence points to a role for B lymphocyte stimulator ( BLyS) overproduction in murine and human systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE).

BLyS protein, full - length BLyS mRNA, and Delta BLyS mRNA levels were greater in SLE patients ( n = 60) than in rheumatoid arthritis patients ( n = 60) or normal control individuals ( n = 30).

BLyS - transgenic mice often develop SLE - like features as they age [ 3 - 5], and SLE - prone ( NZB x NZW) F1 ( BWF1) and MRL - lpr / lpr mice respond clinically to treatment with BLyS antagonists ( decreased disease progression and improved survival) [ 3, 6].

Cross - sectional studies have demonstrated elevated circulating levels of BLyS in 20 - 30% of human SLE patients tested at a single point in time [ 7, 8].

Moreover, a 12 - month longitudinal study documented persistently elevated serum BLyS levels in about 25% of SLE patients and intermittently elevated serum BLyS levels in an additional 25% of patients [ 9].

In this report we demonstrate that peripheral blood leukocytes from SLE patients express elevated mRNA levels of both full - length BLyS and Delta BLyS relative to those levels expressed by patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA) or by normal control individuals.

Based solely on the patient ' s willingness to donate a second blood sample, repeat blood samples were collected from 37 of the SLE patients 147 - 511 days ( median 371 days) after collection of the first samples.

Arbitrary assignment of the 95th percentile value among the normal control individuals as the upper limit of ' normal ' revealed that two of the 30 normal control individuals, 15 of the 60 RA patients, and 29 of the 60 SLE patients harbored elevated plasma BLyS levels ( P < 0. 001).

The geometric mean full - length BLyS mRNA and Delta BLyS mRNA levels among the SLE patients were each significantly greater than those among the RA patients and normal control individuals, respectively ( P < 0. 001 for each; Figure 1b, c).

Among these SLE patients, none of the measured BLyS parameters correlated with patient age, sex, race, or daily dose of corticosteroids ( data not shown).

The failure to demonstrate a significant correlation cannot be attributed to a skewing of the results by the patients in whom plasma BLyS levels were below the limit of detection, because no significant correlation was detected among the 53 SLE patients in whom plasma BLyS levels were in the detectable range ( r = 0. 185, P = 0. 183).

These results cannot be ascribed to changes in medications taken by the patients, because changes in neither disease activity nor in any of the BLyS parameters correlated with changes in the doses of corticosteroids or cytotoxics taken by the patients ( data not shown).

The failure to demonstrate a meaningful association between changes in SLEDAI score and changes in plasma BLyS protein levels cannot be attributed to a skewing of the results by the patients in whom plasma BLyS levels were below the limit of detection, because the absence of association between the two persisted among the 27 SLE patients in whom plasma BLyS levels were in the detectable range in both samples ( r = - 0. 069, P = 0. 727 for plasma BLyS versus unmodified SLEDAI; r = - 0. 020, P = 0. 919 for plasma BLyS versus modified SLEDAI).

Filters were hybridized by the published procedure ( 13) either with the nick - translated chromosomal DNA containing human IL - 2 gene and its flanking region ( total length, 7. 0 kb, ref. 9) ( lane 1 - 8) or with the nick - translated cDNA for mouse IL - 2 ( see figure).

rps10 is a suitable model because it contains a group II intron, is absent in wheat mitochondria but is actively expressed in potato mitochondria, where transcripts are spliced and undergo five C - to - U editing events.

In wheat mitochondria, rps10 transcripts were neither spliced nor edited while they are correctly processed in potato mitochondria.

Of particular interest is the situation of the small ribosomal protein 10 gene ( rps10), a group II intron - bearing gene which is encoded in Solanum tuberosum mitochondrial DNA but is absent from the wheat mitochondrial genome ( 20).

Here, we show that a potato rps10 construct is transcribed when introduced into wheat mitochondria, but transcripts are not recognized by the post - transcriptional processing machinery.

The vectors pRPS10W and the pRPS10St derivative, containing wheat and potato cox2 promoters, respectively, were constructed by inserting the 1178 bp rps10 sequence containing two exons separated by a 777 bp intronic sequence [ ( 23), accession no.

Electrotransfer experiments were carried out with 1 mg of purified wheat embryo or potato tuber mitochondria in 50 micro l of 0. 33 M sucrose and 1 micro g of recombinant plasmid as described ( 14).

The S. tuberosum rps10 construct under control of a wheat cox2 promoter ( Figure 1A) was incorporated into purified wheat mitochondria by electroporation as indicated in Materials and Methods.

While wheat cox2 editing sites were correctly edited in control as expected ( Figure 1C, only site C77 is shown), all five editable residues in potato rps10 transcript remain unchanged.

Since two important post - transcriptional processes, RNA editing and splicing, were inoperative when S. tuberosum rps10 was expressed in wheat mitochondria, we decided to verify whether the negative results were inherent to the rps10 chimeric constructs or due to the lack of trans - recognition elements in wheat mitochondria.

As shown in Figure 4, the construct containing the wheat or potato promoters was transcribed only in cognate mitochondria.

In contrast to wheat mitochondria, the 821 nt mature transcript was only detected when the electroporated potato mitochondria were incubated in the presence of fatty acid - free BSA.

The construct expressing potato rps10 under the control of potato cox2 promoter was introduced into S. tuberosum isolated mitochondria.

As reported previously, the 23 nt region forming the C259 editing site from wheat cox2 was efficiently edited when grafted into a different context in a wheat transcript ( 17).	"wheat	76	81	Organism/Species"	"wheat	153	158	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Unexpectedly, wheat mitochondria appear to be unable to edit the cognate C259 site when the - 16 / + 6 region is located on a potato rps10 precursor.	"wheat	14	19	Organism/Species"	"potato	126	132	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Interestingly, while C259 insertion was not recognized in wheat mitochondria ( Figure 6D), the potato RNA editing machinery edited the inserted C259 region ( Figure 6E).	"wheat	58	63	Organism/Species"	"potato	95	101	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
rps10 was chosen precisely because this genetic information is lacking in wheat mitochondria but is active in potato mitochondria ( 20, 23, 25).	"wheat	74	79	Organism/Species"	"potato	110	116	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Potato tuber mitochondria were able to incorporate DNA essentially under the same conditions described for wheat embryo organelles ( 14), except that the optimal voltage range was larger.

A major difference to wheat was that isolated potato mitochondria were viable for 3 - 4 h as measured by oxygen consumption ( data not shown).	"wheat	22	27	Organism/Species"	"potato	46	52	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
An interesting observation was that neither the wheat nor the potato cox2 promoters were recognized in a heterologous context ( Figure 4A and B).	"wheat	48	53	Organism/Species"	"potato	62	68	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This situation might by explained by the fact that potato and wheat promoter sequences have no recognizable homologous motifs.	"potato	51	57	Organism/Species"	"wheat	62	67	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
While the transcription initiation site in wheat mitochondria is located at position - 170 ( 29), the potato promoter has not yet been described.	"wheat	43	48	Organism/Species"	"potato	102	108	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The potato rps10 gene controlled by a T. aestivum promoter ( Figure 1A) was transcribed as a 1204 nt precursor in wheat mitochondria, but no traces of mature RNA were observed.

This is consistent with the hypothesis that potato and wheat mitochondria have similar trans - acting factors for cox2 intron removal.	"potato	44	50	Organism/Species"	"wheat	55	60	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Since wheat mitochondria do not have rps10 encoded in the mitochondrial genome ( 20), it was interesting to test whether wheat mitochondria were able to recognize editing sites which had been lost during evolution.	"wheat	6	11	Organism/Species"	"wheat	121	126	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This led us to postulate that the inability of wheat mitochondria to recognize rps10 editing sites is likely due to the fact that wheat mitochondria have lost the editing trans - recognition elements which become dispensable after transfer of rps10 to the nucleus.	"wheat	47	52	Organism/Species"	"wheat	130	135	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The wheat C259 editing site in the chimeric construct was correctly edited by potato mitochondria.

The fact that the wheat editing site C259 inserted in chimeric rps10 transcripts was not recognized by wheat mitochondria is a strong argument for this hypothesis.
