Moreover, rps10 transcripts undergo five C - to - U editing events in potato mitochondria and rps10 contains an intron, thus facilitating the analysis of post - transcriptional processing.

These results clearly demonstrate that C2 and C3 editing is not sufficient for splicing of rps10 precursor in wheat mitochondria and lead us to conclude that splicing failure is probably linked to the lack of trans - recognition elements.

The fact that the four editing sites were found either edited or unedited in spliced rps10 mRNA is an indication that editing does not precede splicing as was previously found for cox2 in wheat ( 15).

In the IGR - N - 91 cell line, where p53 harbors two contiguous sets of exons 7 - 9, spanning the DBD and oligomerization domain, it is interesting to note that the yeast colonies were predominantly white ( Figure 4B, dish b) with the split 5 ' and the split 3 ' assay ( 96 and 87% of white colonies, respectively) This suggests that the cells express a binding ability that is specific to wild - type p53 rather than mutated p53 ( Table 2).
