Fitzpatrick et al [ 5] in turn rebutted some aspects of the hypothesis of Sibley et al [ 4], publishing video stills of Pileated Woodpeckers, and a model of a Pileated Woodpecker, that appeared to show a black trailing edge to the wings inconsistent with Ivory - billed Woodpecker and the Luneau video.

It remains possible that the flight pattern of the bird in the Luneau video is unusual for Pileated Woodpecker, but a frequency of 8. 6 s - 1 is consistent with a Pileated Woodpecker gaining initial speed and height in escape flight, and by itself cannot be taken as strong evidence that the Luneau video bird was an Ivory - billed Woodpecker.
