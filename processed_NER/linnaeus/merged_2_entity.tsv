As shown in Tables 1 and 2, although the mean wingbeat frequencies of the Pileated Woodpeckers in DN ' s video are slower than the 8. 6 s - 1 recorded for the bird in the Luneau video [ 1, 3, 5] the first four wingbeats, the initial escape response, are faster than those claimed for Pileated Woodpeckers in the literature [ 1, 3, 5].

However, analysis of the bird in the Luneau video in light of images of known Pileated Woodpeckers confirms that a similar black trailing edge to the wing is discernable in some frames of the Luneau video ( compare Figure 1B, frame 775 with Figure 1A, frame 366. 7: the apparent plumage patterns are similar, and inconsistent with Ivory - billed Woodpecker).

It is argued here that the hypothesis put forward in Sibley et al [ 4] is correct, and that the black trailing edge of the underwing of Pileated Woodpecker can indeed, due to flexion of the wings during the downstroke, be misinterpreted as the black leading edge and wingtips of the upperwing of an Ivory - billed Woodpecker.

The three plumage features described in Sibley et al [ 4] that are incompatible with Ivory - billed Woodpecker ( black secondary feathers on upper surface of left wing, brighter white primary bases, and a black band curling round the wing tip) are seen consistently in the Luneau video and are recapitulated throughout the video of Pileated Woodpecker.

Evidence is presented here to show that the distinctive plumage features of Pileated Woodpecker are surprisingly difficult to resolve in poor - quality video of birds in escape flight away from the camera, and that they can show apparent plumage patterns that might more readily be associated with Ivory - billed Woodpecker.

This analysis has shown that the hypothesis presented in Sibley et al [ 4] is plausible, i. e. that some of the frames interpreted by [ 1] to show the upperwing of an Ivory - billed Woodpecker may in fact show large amounts of white and the black trailing edge from the underwing of a Pileated Woodpecker.

Birds flap more rapidly at take off to gain altitude and speed than they do in sustained level flight: Pileated Woodpecker flight data in the literature [ 1, 4, 5] was derived from the work of Tobalske [ 8], which explicitly excluded the initial take - off period, and therefore cannot be used to support the elimination of Pileated Woodpecker in the Luneau video.

Arbitrary assignment of the 95th percentile value among the normal control individuals as the upper limit of ' normal ' revealed that two of the 30 normal control individuals, 15 of the 60 RA patients, and 29 of the 60 SLE patients harbored elevated plasma BLyS levels ( P < 0. 001).	patients,192,200,Organism/Species	patients,223,231,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 192, ""end_span"": 200, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 223, ""end_span"": 231, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	train

The failure to demonstrate a significant correlation cannot be attributed to a skewing of the results by the patients in whom plasma BLyS levels were below the limit of detection, because no significant correlation was detected among the 53 SLE patients in whom plasma BLyS levels were in the detectable range ( r = 0. 185, P = 0. 183).	patients,109,117,Organism/Species	patients,245,253,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 245, ""end_span"": 253, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	train

The failure to demonstrate a meaningful association between changes in SLEDAI score and changes in plasma BLyS protein levels cannot be attributed to a skewing of the results by the patients in whom plasma BLyS levels were below the limit of detection, because the absence of association between the two persisted among the 27 SLE patients in whom plasma BLyS levels were in the detectable range in both samples ( r = - 0. 069, P = 0. 727 for plasma BLyS versus unmodified SLEDAI; r = - 0. 020, P = 0. 919 for plasma BLyS versus modified SLEDAI).	patients,182,190,Organism/Species	patients,331,339,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 182, ""end_span"": 190, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 331, ""end_span"": 339, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	train

The likely explanation for the weak correlation between circulating BLyS levels and disease activity in human SLE is not that disease activity in SLE patients is insensitive to the degree of BLyS overproduction.	human,104,109,Organism/Species	patients,150,158,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	train
