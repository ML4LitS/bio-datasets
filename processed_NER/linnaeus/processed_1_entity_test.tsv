"women	29	34	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""women"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In men, BMI and leptin seemed to play a main role in influencing the insulin resistance index HOMA IR, while TGL, ACL IgG and LDL - cholesterol didn ' t play any significant role ( see left columns of Table 4).	"men	3	6	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""men"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 6, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In women ( see right columns of Table 4), the maximal values of R2 were achieved with combination of independent variables containing TGL, leptin and HDL - cholesterol ( about 60% influence on HOMA IR! - see Table 4A, 4B, 4C).	"women	3	8	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""women"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
TNF alpha seemed to play quite a different role than in men: after exclusion of this factor from the group of independent factors R2significantly decreased ( see Table 4B, 4D).	"men	56	59	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""men"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In contrast to men, the role of BMI seemed to be minimal.	"men	15	18	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""men"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In the control group of women the correlation between leptin and HOMA IR was highly significant.	"women	24	29	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""women"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
However, in hyperlipemic women the significance of this correlation lessened, because HOMA IR increased considerably ( and significantly) but serum concentration of leptin only slightly ( insignificantly).	"women	25	30	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""women"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In men the significance of correlations between serum leptin and HOMA IR was high and approximately the same in both the control and hyperlipemic groups, because the values of HOMA IR as well as serum leptin have nearly doubled in hyperlipemic in relation to control groups.	"men	3	6	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""men"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 6, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
A significant increase of insulin resistance in hyperlipemic women was associated by only slight and insignificant increase of leptin concentration.	"women	61	66	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""women"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In men, only BMI and HDL - cholesterol from other factors studied seemed to play a certain role, but the maximal values of influencing HOMA IR reached only 39%, with leptin and BMI being the more important factors.	"men	3	6	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""men"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 6, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
On the other hand, in women the maximal determination of HOMA IR as high as 60% was registered in combination of serum leptin, TGL and decreased HDL - cholesterol as independent factors; the role of BMI was insignificant.	"women	22	27	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""women"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
A strong correlation between plasma leptin and fasting insulin undoubtedly exists, but hyperleptinemia in both obese and lean humans is not likely the result of hyperinsulinemia [ 37].	"humans	126	132	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""humans"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Percentage of body fat has been shown to be the strongest predictor of leptin levels even in lean women [ 41].	"women	98	103	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""women"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
These findings contrast with our results showing minimal influence of BMI on HOMA IR in postmenopausal women.	"women	103	108	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""women"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
However, the insulin resistance - related to intra - abdominal fat mass - did not differ from men.	"men	94	97	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""men"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The significant increase of insulin resistance and leptin concentration in hyperlipemic men might reflect the growing content of both subcutaneous and intra - abdominal fat mass ( see the significant increase of BMI).	"men	88	91	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""men"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In hyperlipemic women the significant increase of insulin resistance accompanying only minimal insignificant increase of leptin could be caused by prevalent growing of intra - abdominal fat mass.	"women	16	21	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""women"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In elderly postmenopausal women, an association between leptin and plasma lipoprotein concentration was found which depended on adiposity [ 17], and inverse correlations between serum leptin and HDL - cholesterol were described [ 44].	"women	26	31	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""women"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
These findings might be important in considering the concept of treatment of insulin resistance - related disorders in postmenopausal women.	"women	134	139	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""women"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Serum concentration of TNF alpha in patients with type 2 diabetes of both genders correlated only with the quantity of intra - abdominal fat compartment [ 50].	"patients	36	44	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We came to this conclusion irrespective of the finding that the increase of serum TNF alpha in hyperlipemic women was statistically insignificant; results of Spearman ' s correlation ( Table 3) and multiple regression analysis confirm a distinct role of this factor.	"women	108	113	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""women"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In hyperlipemic men not only the serum concentration of TNF alpha has decreased instead of increasing, but according to multiple regression analysis it played a quite different role in influencing insulin sensitivity, interfering with factors that determined insulin resistance ( leptin and BMI).	"men	16	19	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""men"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In the control group of men IgG anticardiolipin was inversely correlated to HOMA IR.	"men	24	27	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""men"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This factor was very weakly associated only with HOMA IR in women ( see Table 4D), indicating that enhanced metabolisation of fatty acids in cells might to some degree contribute to insulin resistance.	"women	60	65	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""women"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
These findings are explained as a consequence of gender - related differences in adipose tissue composition and / or distribution in both normal - weight and over - weight subjects and should be taken into account in treatment of patients with metabolic risk factors of cardiovascular diseases.

Alexithymia is highly prevalent among chronic pain patients.	"patients	51	59	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of alexithymia and to determine anxiety levels among DSM - IV somatoform pain disorder ( chronic pain) female patients and to examine the relationship between alexithymia and the self - reporting of pain.	"patients	170	178	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 170, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Thirty seven healthy females ( mean age: 34, 46 + / - 7, 43 years), who matched for sociodemographic features with the patient group, consisted the control group.	"patient	119	126	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
A sociodemographic data form, 26 - item Toronto Alexithymia Scale ( TAS - 26), Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI) were administered to each subject and information was obtained on several aspects of the patients ' pain, including intensity ( measured by VAS), and duration.	"patients	212	220	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 212, ""end_span"": 220, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

Neither positive correlation nor significant difference was found between alexithymia and trait anxiety in pain patients.	"patients	112	120	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Several studies have found a high prevalence of alexithymia in pain patients.	"patients	68	76	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Chronic pain patients frequently exhibit many of the core features of alexithymia, such as problems in identifying and describing subjective feelings, impoverished imaginative abilities, and excessive preoccupation with physical symptoms and external events.	"patients	13	21	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Although several studies have found a high prevalence of alexithymia in pain patients, the way alexithymia may possibly influence pain experience is still unclear [ 12, 13].	"patients	77	85	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In chronic pain disorder, patients complain of chronic pain, for which no physical etiology could be found or the underlying disorder is insufficient in explaining the symptoms.	"patients	26	34	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The alexithymic person ' s difficulty in identifying and describing feelings may increase symptom reporting by several mechanisms.	"person	16	22	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""person"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Accordingly, previous studies have found evidence of an association between alexithymia and the development of functional somatic symptoms, as seen in patients with somatoform disorders.	"patients	151	159	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 151, ""end_span"": 159, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

Regarding the pain assessment, information was first obtained on several aspects of the patients ' pain, such as intensity, and duration.	"patients	88	96	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
VAS is scored by measuring the distance from the end of the scale indicating absence of pain ( or no distress or no pain relief) to the place marked by the patient [ 24].

In the chronic pain group, 56. 7% of patients ( n = 17) had a score greater than 11 on the TAS - 26, and were considered alexithymic.	"patients	37	45	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In the control group, 24, 3% of patients ( n = 9) were alexithymic according to TAS - 26.	"patients	32	40	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The duration and severity of pain, TAS - 26 scores, and STAI scores of the female pain patients are shown in Table 2.	"patients	87	95	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
First, chronic pain patients were found significantly more alexithymic than controls ( 56, 7% to 24, 3%).	"patients	20	28	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Third, neither positive correlation nor significant difference was found between alexithymia and trait anxiety in pain patients.	"patients	119	127	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The results of the present study suggest that patients with chronic pain disorder are more alexithymic than individuals with no pain.	"patients	46	54	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
There were no significant differences between alexithymic and nonalexitymic patients on self reports of current pain severity.	"patients	76	84	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Pain is a subjective experience and each patient may communicate in a different way, verbally or nonverbally [ 29].	"patient	41	48	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Patients in this sample were sufferers of chronic pain, who had already chosen an approved way of expressing their distress.	"Patients	0	8	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Patients"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The duration of the patients ' pain could approximately be determined, yet the preexisting level of alexithymia was not known.	"patients	20	28	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In the usual absence of internal stimuli, alexithymic person may be expected to maintain an external focus of attention, such as pain.	"person	54	60	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""person"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Symptom chronicity may force the alexithymic person to attent to and amplify this somatic sensation.	"person	45	51	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""person"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Therefore, alexithymic patients might be expected to differ from nonalexithymic ones in their anxiety levels.	"patients	23	31	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Yet, in our pain group alexithymic patients showed no significant difference from the nonalexithymics on trait anxiety.	"patients	35	43	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The reasons may be lying in the specific characteristics of this patient group itself.	"patient	65	72	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The study included patients suffering from chronic symptoms; with an average of 7, 44 + / - 6, 82 years of pain in the alexithymic and 3, 31 + / - 2, 79 years in the nonalexithymic groups.

It is not known whether it should be addressed in the treatment of pain patients, but a high level of alexithymia may effect the nature of assessment.	"patients	72	80	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

When we compare L. intermedia and L. whitmani, we find a highly significant Fst value ( 0. 3373), which is however smaller than that observed for the period gene between sympatric siblings of Lutzomyia longipalpis ( Fst = 0. 3952) [ 23], a complex of cryptic species that are vectors of American visceral leishmaniasis.

Introgression of genes that control adaptation to particular types of environment can also have a major impact on the spread of vector - borne diseases as was proposed for the major African malaria vector Anopheles gambiae [ 41].

Additionally Weissman and colleagues [ 17] demonstrated that patients with SLE can display radiographic abnormalities similar to those of RA, although the presence of marginal erosions is a rare finding.

We found high titers of anti - CCP antibodies in four of seven ( 57%) patients with rhupus, a frequency similar to that reported for RA [ 4].	"patients	70	78	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The high prevalence of anti - CCP antibodies in RA found in our study could be explained by a selection bias because only patients with RA with an aggressive disease ( namely erosive arthritis and RF +) were included.	"patients	122	130	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In contrast, the mean ACR criterion for SLE was similar between patients with rhupus and those with SLE, including the ' robust ' features of SLE such as renal and neurological involvement, and anti - dsDNA and anti - Sm antibodies.	"patients	64	72	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
These clinical and serological features shared between patients with rhupus and those with SLE also place rhupus in the SLE spectrum.	"patients	55	63	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Because of the small number of patients, we are unable to define the differential features underlying each subset.	"patients	31	39	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

On the basis of the presence of shared clinical features of RA ( mainly erosive arthritis) and SLE ( including renal and neurological involvement) along with the presence of anti - dsDNA and anti - CCP autoantibodies in our patients with rhupus, our findings strongly support the contention that rhupus is a true overlap between RA and SLE, not merely a part of the clinical spectrum of the articular involvement seen in SLE.

In the present study, we show that the purified CD16 - human peripheral blood monocyte subset, but not the CD16 + monocyte subset, differentiates into osteoclast by stimulation with receptor activator of NF - kappa B ligand ( RANKL) in combination with macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( M - CSF).

In accordance with these reports, our data showed that knockdown of integrin - beta 3 expression resulted in downregulation of the alpha v beta 3 heterodimer, and abrogated osteoclastogenesis from human peripheral blood CD16 - monocytes.

Of note, it is reported that patients with Iraqi - Jewish - type Glanzmann thrombasthenia who are deficient in integrin beta 3 do not develop osteopetrosis because of the upregulation of alpha 2 beta 1 expression on osteoclasts, although the bone - resorptive ability of the osteoclasts was decreased in vitro [ 35].

If our results indicating that BDNF promotes proliferation of TrkB - positive sympathoblasts in the chicken embryo can be extrapolated to the subset of TrkB - positive sympathoblasts in murine ganglia, then these TrkB - positive cells may be neurons destined to innervate the erector pilli.

The upperwing of the Ivory - billed Woodpecker is black, with white secondary feathers and white on some inner primary feathers.	"Ivory - billed Woodpecker	21	46	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Ivory - billed Woodpecker"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Pileated Woodpeckers have a largely black upperwing, with white restricted to the ' wrist ' due to white bases to the primary feathers.	"Pileated Woodpeckers	0	20	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Pileated Woodpeckers"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The underwing of Pileated Woodpecker has all - white underwing coverts, giving an appearance of a white underwing with a broad black outline ( the black flight feathers).	"Pileated Woodpecker	17	36	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Pileated Woodpecker"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
They pointed out individual frames of the Luneau video that appear to show three features that are each inconsistent with Ivory - billed Woodpecker: ( 1) apparently black secondary feathers on the upper surface of the left wing, ( 2) particularly bright white primary bases, and ( 3) a black band curving smoothly round the wing tip ( see Figure 3 in [ 4]).	"Ivory - billed Woodpecker	122	147	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Ivory - billed Woodpecker"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 147, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
They hypothesized that flexing of a Pileated Woodpecker ' s wings during flight could produce the appearance of white trailing edges on both wings in low - quality videos [ 4].	"Pileated Woodpecker	36	55	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Pileated Woodpecker"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
They offered, however, no direct evidence to show that this could cause a video of a Pileated Woodpecker to look like the bird in the Luneau video.	"Pileated Woodpecker	85	104	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Pileated Woodpecker"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
On one hand, as pointed out in Sibley et al [ 4], some of the frames of the bird in the Luneau video do appear to be inconsistent with Ivory - billed Woodpecker.	"Ivory - billed Woodpecker	135	160	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Ivory - billed Woodpecker"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 160, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Furthermore, the general impression of the bird in the Luneau video was that there is far too much white in the wings for it to be a Pileated Woodpecker, and that if it was a Pileated, then it must be an aberrant one with abnormally extensive white plumage.	"Pileated Woodpecker	133	152	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Pileated Woodpecker"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This study was undertaken to determine whether the flight and plumage of the bird in the Luneau video really was inconsistent with either a normal or partial albino Pileated Woodpecker.

The Pileated woodpeckers in DN ' s video do not do this - after initial rapid flapping immediately after take - off, they settle into a more relaxed level flight.	"Pileated woodpeckers	4	24	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Pileated woodpeckers"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The bird in the Luneau video maintains a frequency of 8. 6 s - 1 for the next four wingbeats too, whereas the Pileated Woodpeckers recorded here all slowed their flight as they prepared to land in nearby trees.	"Pileated Woodpeckers	110	130	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Pileated Woodpeckers"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
There are no data to suggest whether Pileated Woodpeckers can maintain a wingbeat frequency approaching 8. 6 s - 1 for eight or more wingbeats, like the bird in the Luneau video.

The video of Pileated Woodpeckers in flight was obtained in avi format, decompiled and examined frame by frame.	"Pileated Woodpeckers	13	33	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Pileated Woodpeckers"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The images of the birds are not identical, but in every frame of the 36 frames available, there are sufficient similarities to suggest that the bird in the Luneau video is consistent with the known Pileated Woodpecker.

Further comparisons of the Luneau bird with the other three Pileated escape flights recorded are presented in the supplementary material ( see Additional file 1).	"Pileated	60	68	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Pileated"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Pileated Woodpeckers flying near - horizontally away from the observer show much more white in poor - quality video than would be expected from their general plumage pattern.	"Pileated Woodpeckers	0	20	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Pileated Woodpeckers"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The expected appearance of the upperwing of Pileated Woodpecker - mostly black with a small white patch at the base of the primaries - is often not seen, and is only clearly resolvable when birds are flying near - vertically before landing on a tree trunk; something the bird in the Luneau video did not do.	"Pileated Woodpecker	44	63	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Pileated Woodpecker"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The black trailing edge to the underwing of Pileated Woodpecker is often very inconspicuous and may disappear completely.	"Pileated Woodpecker	44	63	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Pileated Woodpecker"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In many frames of Pileated Woodpecker, a black trailing edge to the wing is discernable ( though due to bleeding of white as a video artifact, it appears narrower than it really is).	"Pileated Woodpecker	18	37	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Pileated Woodpecker"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Figure 3 shows that the plumage patterns shown by the Luneau bird, throughout several wingbeat cycles, are compatible with Pileated Woodpecker.	"Pileated Woodpecker	123	142	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Pileated Woodpecker"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Irrespective of the identity of the bird in the Luneau video, this knowledge will be critical to assessment of further claims of Ivory - billed Woodpeckers during the current intensive search effort.	"Ivory - billed Woodpeckers	129	155	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Ivory - billed Woodpeckers"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 155, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The wingbeat frequency of the bird in the Luneau video is also perhaps consistent with Pileated Woodpecker, at least for short periods of flight.	"Pileated Woodpecker	87	106	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Pileated Woodpecker"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Analysis of the videos of Pileated Woodpecker has supported the hypothesised interpretations of key frames of the Luneau video by Sibley et al [ 4].	"Pileated Woodpecker	26	45	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Pileated Woodpecker"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Although the rebuttal of that comment in Fitzpatrick et al [ 5] asserted that flexion and motion of wings of Pileated Woodpeckers could not produce the images seen in the Luneau video, it has been shown here that they can.	"Pileated Woodpeckers	109	129	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Pileated Woodpeckers"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
It is argued in this paper that, in fact, the black trailing edge of the wing of a Pileated Woodpecker is seen clearly in the Luneau video, during the downstroke of the wingbeat cycle, but that it has been misinterpreted as black wingtips ( Figure 1, 2, 3).	"Pileated Woodpecker	83	102	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Pileated Woodpecker"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The authors summarise nine diagnostic traits from their analysis of the Luneau video that identify the bird as Ivory - billed Woodpecker.	"Ivory - billed Woodpecker	111	136	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Ivory - billed Woodpecker"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Data presented in this paper show that this statement is not wholly supported, and in any case the underwing of Pileated Woodpeckers can present the same appearance.	"Pileated Woodpeckers	112	132	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Pileated Woodpeckers"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
' The upperwing pattern in flight consistently shows a broad, white trailing edge, with no frames demonstrating the conspicuous dark rear border to be expected of normal Pileated Woodpeckers.

Notwithstanding that certain frames of the Luneau video ( e. g. frame 350) do appear to show a black trailing edge to the upperwing, data presented in this paper shows that, at this angle of view and resolution of video, Pileated Woodpeckers also may fail to show this feature.

Reenactment of the scene using real Pileated Woodpeckers has produced images remarkably similar to the Luneau video.	"Pileated Woodpeckers	36	56	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Pileated Woodpeckers"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
' The wingbeat frequency is 8. 6 beats per second, which is almost identical to that recorded for Ivory - billed Woodpecker ( as documented by one acoustic record from 1935).

The fact that in only four recorded escape flights of Pileated Woodpecker, two were recorded for which the initial escape flight wingbeat frequency ( 8. 0 s - 1 and 8. 6 s - 1) exceeded that previously recorded for this species shows that previous datasets were too limited to make this conclusion.	"Pileated Woodpecker	54	73	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Pileated Woodpecker"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Tanner [ 9] noted that Pileated Woodpeckers can maintain extended fast direct flight.	"Pileated Woodpeckers	23	43	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Pileated Woodpeckers"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The figure of 8. 6 wingbeats per second for the Luneau bird ( data reanalysed here) is taken as consistent with Ivory - billed Woodpecker on the basis of analysis of a single archival audio recording [ 3].

The Ivory - billed Woodpecker in that audio tape is clearly flapping its wings, but without accompanying visual confirmation it is not clear that it is in flight.

Further comment is conjecture: while the flight pattern and wing posture of the bird in the Luneau video may be unusual, it has not been shown that it is outside the range of variability of Pileated Woodpecker, and cannot therefore be used to eliminate the possibility that it was the commoner species.

Nevertheless, this remains the best evidence that the Luneau bird was not a standard Pileated Woodpecker.	"Pileated Woodpecker	85	104	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Pileated Woodpecker"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

Central to the identification of the flying bird seen in the Luneau video was the evidence that plumage and flight patterns were inconsistent with Pileated Woodpecker.

There appears to be no reason to question the anecdotal sight records of Ivory - billed Woodpecker presented in Fitzpatrick et al [ 1] ( or in many online sources), because some of them appear credible, albeit brief.

The Ivory - billed Woodpecker may persist in continental North America, and there is enough anecdotal evidence to make this a possibility, but the Luneau video does not support the case.

While this paper was under review, a report of sight records and sound recordings of Ivory - billed Woodpeckers was published from a location in Florida [ 12].

Second, one organism, Buchnera aphidicola, presents these genes with a similarity just below the cut - off used for the analysis, but they have been considered since it is well known that in this mutualistic endosymbiont the accelerated evolution and AT bias affect all its genes, including the 16S rRNA [ 8, 9].

Taiwan ' s primary community care network ( PCCN) demonstration project, funded by the Bureau of National Health Insurance on March 2003, was established to discourage hospital shopping behavior of people and drive the traditional fragmented health care providers into cooperate care models.

The unique phenomenon characterized in Taiwan health care industry different from those in the western countries is the freedom of patients to choose the health care providers they want, no matter what their disease severity is.

The idea of member component design in PCCNs was aimed to lead the Taiwan citizens to choose one clinic physician as their personal family physician for health maintenance and this family physician also would have the responsibility of referring the patients to specialty care if necessary.	"patients	250	258	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 250, ""end_span"": 258, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In summary, the PCCN demonstration project was aimed to: 1) change the traditional patients ' customs of freely choosing health care organizations and establish referral channels along the continuum of care, and 2) establish partnerships among the primary care clinics and hospitals to provide a continuum of health care services.	"patients	83	91	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

"All the clinic physicians in a PCCN are assigned the roles of "" family physicians "" or "" gatekeepers "" who recruit people from the local community, keep background and medical files on them, certify family physician education training programs, and hold office hours in the member hospital, where they serve as joint faculty members for further medical consultations or medical utilizations of labs and tests, if necessary."

Then, guided by the goals and missions of the organization, top managers shape the design of the organization, including structural forms, information system, technology, human resources, organizational culture, and inter - organizational linkages, to achieve the final organizational performance.

Borrowing the ideas of strategic contingency perspective [ 8, 15, 19] and top management model [ 14], it could be imply that success ( organization performance) in reengineering a network lies in the integration of process and services ( see Figure 1), including leadership / governing structure, teamwork between disciplines and patient care, financial planning, and information systems, characterized as the constructs of governance, clinical, financial, and information infrastructures, respectively, in this study.	"patient	330	337	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 330, ""end_span"": 337, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In addition, another construct, marketing infrastructure, was especially important and designed to explore for PCCNs in this study because of patients ' freedom of making healthcare choice and the traditional fragmented health care systems by individual health care organizations in Taiwan.

Governance or administrative integration infrastructure in establishing network partnerships refers to administrative structures ( or responsibilities) created to facilitate communication, clear lines of authority, accountability, and responsibility for patient care services; to negotiate budgets and financial trade - offs; and to present a cohesive, consistent message in interactions with external agencies and the community [ 29, 39 - 41] and most important for members in contract agreements, to manage participation [ 33].

Syndrome of arachnomelia in Simmental cattle	"cattle	38	44	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""cattle"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The syndrome of arachnomelia is an inherited malformation mainly of limbs, back and head in cattle.	"cattle	92	98	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""cattle"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
At present the arachnomelia syndrome has been well known mainly in Brown Swiss cattle.	"cattle	79	85	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""cattle"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Recently, stillborn Simmental calves were observed having a morphology similar to the arachnomelia syndrome.	"calves	30	36	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""calves"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
By 2007, an additional 140 calves with the arachnomelia syndrome were identified.	"calves	27	33	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""calves"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
It could be shown that, with the exception of two cases that were considered as phenocopies, all of the paternal and about two - third of the maternal pedigrees of the affected calves could be traced back to one common founder.	"calves	177	183	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""calves"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 183, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

In the year 2006 a syndrome was described in the German and Austrian Simmental ( Fleckvieh, as it is locally called, is the main dual - purpose breed in Germany, in short called Simmental in the further text) population, that was pathologically similar to the arachnomelia syndrome in Brown Swiss cattle [ 1].	"cattle	297	303	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""cattle"", ""start_span"": 297, ""end_span"": 303, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The congenital arachnomelia syndrome ( AS, OMIA Phene ID 139, Group 000059) is mainly a malformation of the skeletal system in cattle that was initially described by Rieck and Schade [ 2] in Holstein Friesian, Red Holstein and Simmental.	"cattle	127	133	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""cattle"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We describe the pathological findings, the familial occurrence and an estimate of the frequency of the diseases allele in Simmental cattle.	"cattle	132	138	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""cattle"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In autumn 2004 a number of stillborn calves with similar malformations of the legs and head were recorded within the monitoring system of anomalies in Simmental.	"calves	37	43	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""calves"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Some of these calves were sent to the veterinary service laboratory for examination, and in December 2005 the first 15 cases of AS were pathologically confirmed.	"calves	14	20	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""calves"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
An increasing number of suspected cases was reported and an additional 136 affected calves were identified by pathological examination by June 2007.	"calves	84	90	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""calves"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Both sexes were equally represented in the 152 ( 80 male, 72 female, chi 2 = 0. 21, p = 0. 64) affected calves.	"calves	104	110	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""calves"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
ROMEL, for example, sired more than 40, 000 cows 4 to 6 years ago.	"cows	44	48	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""cows"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
These progeny were now mated to ROMEL and sons or grandsons of EGEL and REXON resulting in a high probability for the occurrence of affected calves.	"calves	141	147	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""calves"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 147, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Calves under suspicion of the arachnomelia syndrome were sent to the pathology department of the TGD for macroscopic examination.	"Calves	0	6	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Calves"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 6, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The first was the presence of a calf that was diagnosed by pathological investigation.	"calf	32	36	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""calf"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In many cases more than one affected calf per sire was identified [ 8].	"calf	37	41	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""calf"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Some sires had only one affected calf, but a large number of risk - matings.	"calf	33	37	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""calf"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
For this purpose, the probability of observing only a single affected calf among a certain number of risk - matings of the sire in question was calculated.	"calf	70	74	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""calf"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Under these conditions, the probability of observing only one affected calf is lower than 1. 0 percent, if at least 104 risk - matings are given for a single sire.	"calf	71	75	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""calf"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In this case it is very likely that the single affected calf is a phenocopy.	"calf	56	60	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""calf"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Four out of seven cows that were known AS carriers brought to the facilities of the ITZ were used for embryo transfer ( Table 1).	"cows	18	22	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""cows"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Since affected calves did not have different crown - rump - length and their chest circumference was even higher, this can best be explained by a reduced bone mass.	"calves	15	21	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""calves"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Most of the affected calves inherited the AS mutation via REXON or EGEL ( Table 3, Figure 2).	"calves	21	27	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""calves"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
It is well known that in the pre parentage - test era, the frequency of false paternity, especially of the cows, was reasonable high ( up to 23% [ 9]).	"cows	107	111	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""cows"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
First of all, the pedigree structure of the affected calves in Simmental can best be explained by a recessive mode of inheritance.	"calves	53	59	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""calves"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The paternal branch of the pedigree could be traced back to one sire, SEMPER, for all affected calves, the maternal branch in the majority of the cases.	"calves	95	101	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""calves"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Inbreeding loops over a few generations are present in several pedigrees of affected calves, e. g. cases P3364 and P1787 ( Figure 2).	"calves	85	91	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""calves"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In that period 44, 170 calves were born that were sired by ROMEL.	"calves	23	29	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""calves"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
From these, 662 were considered as risk pairings, i. e. the mother had a risk of 0. 5 to be a carrier ( i. e. one of the grandparents was an obligate carrier) and 35 calves out of these were diagnosed as affected.

The allelic frequency was calculated for all cows from the breeding population who were alive in June 2007.	"cows	45	49	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""cows"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The averaged rate of the arachnomelia syndrome carriers based on known carriers over all cows alive in Bavarian Simmental was 3. 32 percent.	"cows	89	93	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""cows"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The cases of malformed Simmental calves presented here showed the same morphology described in the arachnomelia syndrome in Brown Swiss [ e. g. [ 3]], even though there is a certain morphological variation from mild to severe malformations.	"calves	33	39	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""calves"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In that year the allelic frequency of the disease in the cow population increased sharply because some sires that had been carriers of the mutation had become very popular 2 - 4 years before.	"cow	57	60	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""cow"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
A system for monitoring inherited congenital malformations in Bavarian cattle populations was established by the Institute for Animal Breeding of the Bavarian State Research Centre for Agriculture ( ITZ) in cooperation with the Bavarian milk recording organization ( LKV) [ 11].	"cattle	71	77	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""cattle"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In short, a questionnaire was developed for detailed recording of malformed calves.	"calves	76	82	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""calves"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Sires that fit into the pedigree ( progeny of REXON or EGEL) with at least one affected calf with confirmed paternity were defined as obligate carriers and marked in the breeding information system [ 7].

Late morulae and blastocysts collected on day 7 ( day 0 = estrus) from superovulated donor cows were nonsurgically transferred to heifers [ 12].	"cows	91	95	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""cows"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The allelic frequency of the AS mutation in the current cow population was estimated from ancestors with known genotypes following the allele - counting method [ 10].	"cow	56	59	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""cow"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
For this reason two generation pedigrees of herd book cows in Bavarian Simmental were analyzed for obligate carriers.	"cows	54	58	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""cows"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We considered all cows that were alive in June 2007 and included in the herd book.	"cows	18	22	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""cows"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

Excluding the patients mentioned in the present report, only in two was an unquestionably good result obtained.	"patients	14	22	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

In a case - series retrospective study, 14 patients with radiographically confirmed OA at the first MPJ that received up to 3 intra - articular injections of 1 ml hyaluronan ( Ostenil ( R) Mini) ( sodium hyaluronate) reported a statistically significant reduction in pain ( reported using a visual analogue scale) after 6 months [ 14].

Similarly, transformed p8 - expressing cells produced tumours in all athymic nude mice when injected subcutaneously or intraperitoneally, whereas transformed p8 - deficient fibroblasts did not.

On the other hand, studies by another laboratory revealed that expression of the Com1 protein [ 17], which is identical to human p8, mediates the growth of tumour cells after metastatic establishment in a secondary organ, indicating that activated expression of Com1 / p8 in metastatic cells is required for tumour progression.

As a first step, we investigated in the present study the function of p8 in two cell lines derived from human pancreatic cancer.	"human	104	109	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
It was concluded that i / p8 inhibits the growth of human pancreatic cancer cell lines, ii / p8 expression is induced through pathways involved in growth inhibition and, conversely, repressed by factors that promote cell growth.

Also, we found that stimulating cell growth by the complex combination of growth factors contained in fetal calf serum down - regulated expression of p8 whereas, on the contrary, treating the cells with TGF beta - 1, which promotes cell cycle arrest, stimulates p8 expression.

Here we demonstrate that the genome of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans contains sequences that are homologous to the minisatellite core sequence 33. 6 ( 1) and to the simple sequence motif ( AGC) n.

It should be noted, however, that at least in humans, a substantial part of the minisatellites detected by core probes also displays high levels of monomorphism as analysed by cloning ( 1) or by two - dimensional DNA fingerprinting ( 5).

Weinstein ' s summary is illustrative of the fact that Health Behavior Theory has tended to be particularly interested in understanding people ' s motivation to change behavior rather than ability to change.

The theories that Weinstein reviewed deal almost exclusively with behavioral decision processes in people ' s minds.	"people	99	105	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""people"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Broader health behavior theories such as Social Cognitive Theory or the Transtheoretical model have addressed issues and variables outside the person to a greater extent, but the fundamental interest in and belief in psychological variables as the key force in determining health behavior remains.

In the first study, self - efficacy was assessed at baseline, posttreatment, and one year later in 85 men participating in a 15 - week weight - loss program [ 8].	"men	71	74	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""men"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The instruments used for this have typically been formatted similarly to efficacy questionnaires in that people are asked to indicate how difficult they find situational, knowledge, and motivational challenges to achieving diet and exercise changes.

Goal - setting has long been of interest to health behavior theory and in recent years has attracted attention in weight - loss research when it was realized that most people who enter weight - loss treatments want to lose a lot more weight than is realistic given the potency of current weight - loss methodologies [ 15].	"people	168	174	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""people"", ""start_span"": 168, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
When people lose weight they report more social support.	"people	5	11	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""people"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Self - monitoring of health behavior is incorporated into many health behavior theories, usually as part of a person ' s assessment of achieved outcomes.	"person	110	116	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""person"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
People who weigh themselves more weigh less and are more successful in losing weight.	"People	0	6	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""People"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 6, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Behavior scientists have amassed much useful information about the principles underlying human behavior that should be valuable for health behavior interventions.	"human	89	94	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Much is known about human perception, learning, motivation, and responsiveness to environmental opportunities and contingencies.	"human	20	25	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Health behavior intervention lies at the interface between people and their environment.	"people	59	65	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""people"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Interventionists change aspects of the environment ( cues, information, behavioral contingencies) with the intention of producing changes in how people behave.	"people	145	151	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""people"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Data now available suggest that easily obtainable information about people ' s cognitive processes adds little to our ability to predict the results of interventions.	"people	68	74	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""people"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
