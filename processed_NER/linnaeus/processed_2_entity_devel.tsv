rps10 is a suitable model because it contains a group II intron, is absent in wheat mitochondria but is actively expressed in potato mitochondria, where transcripts are spliced and undergo five C - to - U editing events.

rps10 was placed under the control of either potato or wheat cox2 promoters.

In wheat mitochondria, rps10 transcripts were neither spliced nor edited while they are correctly processed in potato mitochondria.

Using the same approach, Staudinger and Kempken ( 18) have reported that transcripts from A. thaliana cox2, but not Sorghum bicolor atp6, are edited when the genes are introduced into maize mitochondria.

Of particular interest is the situation of the small ribosomal protein 10 gene ( rps10), a group II intron - bearing gene which is encoded in Solanum tuberosum mitochondrial DNA but is absent from the wheat mitochondrial genome ( 20).	"Solanum tuberosum	142	159	Organism/Species"	"wheat	201	206	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Solanum tuberosum"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 159, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 201, ""end_span"": 206, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Here, we show that a potato rps10 construct is transcribed when introduced into wheat mitochondria, but transcripts are not recognized by the post - transcriptional processing machinery.

The vectors pRPS10W and the pRPS10St derivative, containing wheat and potato cox2 promoters, respectively, were constructed by inserting the 1178 bp rps10 sequence containing two exons separated by a 777 bp intronic sequence [ ( 23), accession no. X74826].

Electrotransfer experiments were carried out with 1 mg of purified wheat embryo or potato tuber mitochondria in 50 micro l of 0. 33 M sucrose and 1 micro g of recombinant plasmid as described ( 14).	"wheat	67	72	Organism/Species"	"potato	83	89	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The S. tuberosum rps10 construct under control of a wheat cox2 promoter ( Figure 1A) was incorporated into purified wheat mitochondria by electroporation as indicated in Materials and Methods.	"wheat	52	57	Organism/Species"	"wheat	116	121	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
While wheat cox2 editing sites were correctly edited in control as expected ( Figure 1C, only site C77 is shown), all five editable residues in potato rps10 transcript remain unchanged.	"wheat	6	11	Organism/Species"	"potato	144	150	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
cox2 C77 editing sites are identical in potato and wheat.

Since two important post - transcriptional processes, RNA editing and splicing, were inoperative when S. tuberosum rps10 was expressed in wheat mitochondria, we decided to verify whether the negative results were inherent to the rps10 chimeric constructs or due to the lack of trans - recognition elements in wheat mitochondria.	"wheat	138	143	Organism/Species"	"wheat	309	314	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 309, ""end_span"": 314, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
As shown in Figure 4, the construct containing the wheat or potato promoters was transcribed only in cognate mitochondria.

In contrast to wheat mitochondria, the 821 nt mature transcript was only detected when the electroporated potato mitochondria were incubated in the presence of fatty acid - free BSA.	"wheat	15	20	Organism/Species"	"potato	106	112	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The construct expressing potato rps10 under the control of potato cox2 promoter was introduced into S. tuberosum isolated mitochondria.	"potato	25	31	Organism/Species"	"potato	59	65	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
As reported previously, the 23 nt region forming the C259 editing site from wheat cox2 was efficiently edited when grafted into a different context in a wheat transcript ( 17).	"wheat	76	81	Organism/Species"	"wheat	153	158	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Unexpectedly, wheat mitochondria appear to be unable to edit the cognate C259 site when the - 16 / + 6 region is located on a potato rps10 precursor.	"wheat	14	19	Organism/Species"	"potato	126	132	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Interestingly, while C259 insertion was not recognized in wheat mitochondria ( Figure 6D), the potato RNA editing machinery edited the inserted C259 region ( Figure 6E).	"wheat	58	63	Organism/Species"	"potato	95	101	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
rps10 was chosen precisely because this genetic information is lacking in wheat mitochondria but is active in potato mitochondria ( 20, 23, 25).	"wheat	74	79	Organism/Species"	"potato	110	116	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Potato tuber mitochondria were able to incorporate DNA essentially under the same conditions described for wheat embryo organelles ( 14), except that the optimal voltage range was larger.	"Potato	0	6	Organism/Species"	"wheat	107	112	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Potato"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 6, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
A major difference to wheat was that isolated potato mitochondria were viable for 3 - 4 h as measured by oxygen consumption ( data not shown).	"wheat	22	27	Organism/Species"	"potato	46	52	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
An interesting observation was that neither the wheat nor the potato cox2 promoters were recognized in a heterologous context ( Figure 4A and B).	"wheat	48	53	Organism/Species"	"potato	62	68	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This situation might by explained by the fact that potato and wheat promoter sequences have no recognizable homologous motifs.	"potato	51	57	Organism/Species"	"wheat	62	67	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
While the transcription initiation site in wheat mitochondria is located at position - 170 ( 29), the potato promoter has not yet been described.	"wheat	43	48	Organism/Species"	"potato	102	108	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The potato rps10 gene controlled by a T. aestivum promoter ( Figure 1A) was transcribed as a 1204 nt precursor in wheat mitochondria, but no traces of mature RNA were observed.	"potato	4	10	Organism/Species"	"wheat	114	119	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This is consistent with the hypothesis that potato and wheat mitochondria have similar trans - acting factors for cox2 intron removal.	"potato	44	50	Organism/Species"	"wheat	55	60	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Since wheat mitochondria do not have rps10 encoded in the mitochondrial genome ( 20), it was interesting to test whether wheat mitochondria were able to recognize editing sites which had been lost during evolution.	"wheat	6	11	Organism/Species"	"wheat	121	126	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This led us to postulate that the inability of wheat mitochondria to recognize rps10 editing sites is likely due to the fact that wheat mitochondria have lost the editing trans - recognition elements which become dispensable after transfer of rps10 to the nucleus.	"wheat	47	52	Organism/Species"	"wheat	130	135	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The wheat C259 editing site in the chimeric construct was correctly edited by potato mitochondria.

The fact that the wheat editing site C259 inserted in chimeric rps10 transcripts was not recognized by wheat mitochondria is a strong argument for this hypothesis.	"wheat	18	23	Organism/Species"	"wheat	103	108	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

In this report we used the topology assay to address if barrier elements altered local chromatin structure as Drosophila or chicken insulators did ( 40, 41).

Although not statistically significant, we did observe a decrease in survival in mu MT ( mature B cell) deficient mice as early as day 9 post challenge, whereas CD4 - deficient mice produced similar results at day 32 post challenge, indicating a role for B cells independent of CD4 T cell help, perhaps through a T - independent mechanism of antibody production.
