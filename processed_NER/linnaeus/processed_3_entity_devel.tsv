Gene expression studies in isolated mitochondria: Solanum tuberosum rps10 is recognized by cognate potato but not by the transcription, splicing and editing machinery of wheat mitochondria	"Solanum tuberosum	50	67	Organism/Species"	"potato	99	105	Organism/Species"	"wheat	170	175	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Solanum tuberosum"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 170, ""end_span"": 175, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Our aim was to compare processing and editing of potato small ribosomal protein 10 gene ( rps10) transcripts in heterologous ( wheat mitochondria) and homologous ( potato mitochondria) contexts.	"potato	49	55	Organism/Species"	"wheat	127	132	Organism/Species"	"potato	164	170	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 170, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Interestingly, a wheat editing site grafted into rps10 was not recognized by wheat mitochondria but was correctly edited in potato mitochondria.

The chimeric wheat / potato cox2 gene was constructed by replacing 727 bp KpnI / NsiI promoter sequence from pCOXIISt with the 880 bp wheat upstream region from pCOXII.

It should be mentioned that the presence of a conserved sequence is not sufficient for expression since a region that acts as promoter in Arabidopsis, potato and Oenothera is inactive in vivo in pea ( 30).	"Arabidopsis	138	149	Organism/Species"	"potato	151	157	Organism/Species"	"pea	195	198	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Arabidopsis"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""potato"", ""start_span"": 151, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""pea"", ""start_span"": 195, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
It should be noted that the lack of splicing in wheat mitochondria is not a general feature of potato introns, since the potato cox2 intron is removed efficiently ( Figure 4B).

However, partially edited molecules were detected in sorghum - maize atp6 chimeric transcripts when they included the maize atp6 5 ' - untranslated sequence, suggesting that the 5 ' non - coding region provides a structural motif or binding site for a transcript - specific editing factor ( 34).

Higher prevalence of cortical and nuclear cataract in women than men was evident but the difference was only significant for cortical cataract ( age - adjusted odds ratio, OR, for women 1. 3, 95% confidence intervals, CI, 1. 1 - 1. 5 in cross - section I and OR 1. 4, 95% CI 1. 1 - 1. 6 in cross - section II).

In contrast, men had slightly higher PSC prevalence than women in both cross - sections but the difference was not significant ( OR 1. 1, 95% CI 0. 8 - 1. 4 for men in cross - section I and OR 1. 2, 95% 0. 9 - 1. 6 in cross - section II).

The p53RE located within either the human p21 / WAF1 promoter or the intron 1 of the mouse and human BAX gene [ ( 18) and D.

Importantly, two recent studies revealed lack of p19 ( mouse homologue of human p14 ( ARF)) function in mice to inhibit p53 tumor suppressor function in response to ionizing radiation as well as DNA damaging agents [ 29], [ 30].

Two patients were analyzed for gene mutations but omitted from statistical analysis as protocol violators; histopathological examination revealed one patient ( Epi089) to harbor a sarcomatoid tumor, while one patient Epi232 was erroneously enrolled with stage II disease.

Importantly, among another four patients in this study ( Epi063, Epi071, Epi087, Epi153) and one patient from our previous doxorubicin protocol [ 13] harboring the Arg175His mutation together with allelic imbalance for TP53, all five of these patients responded to anthracycline therapy either with a partial response or stable disease.

In contrast, all our three patients harboring a non - functional CHEK2 mutation ( the two Arg95Ter mutated patients here and our previous patient harboring the 1368InsA) expressed primary resistance to therapy.

Horses are highly susceptible to infection and considered the natural reservoir for infection, although mules and donkeys are also susceptible [ 1].
