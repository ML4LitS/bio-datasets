DNA extraction, PCR, sequencing and data analysis Biomass for DNA extraction was collected three times per week, both from the withdrawn reactor samples ( granular phase) and from the effluent ( suspended phase), at the end of the aerated phase.

Arcobacter strains UTICA - S4D1 and MARC - MIP3H16 were isolated from produced fluids collected at 159 days ( from the Utica - Point Pleasant formation, Utica - 8) and 93 days ( from Marcellus Shale, Marcellus - 4) after hydraulic fracturing began, respectively ( Figure 1, Panescu et al., 2018).

Sequences analyzed in a previous study of the microbial diversity of Mono Lake by Humayoun et al. ( 2003), who sampled different depths from the same redox zones at Station 6 ( 2 m, aerobic; 17. 5 m, microaerophilic, 23 m, anoxic; and 35 m, sulfidic, see Humayoun et al., 2003), were downloaded from NCBI GenBank ( n = 274).
