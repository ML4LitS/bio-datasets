Methods Sediment core sample In 2012, the IODP Expedition 337 Deep Coalbed Biosphere off Shimokita was conducted at approximately 80km offshore the Shimokita Peninsula, Japan, in the northwestern Pacific using the deep - sea drilling vessel Chikyu at Site C0020 ( 4110. 5983N, 14212. 0328E, 1180m water depth).

Material and methods Metagenomic datasets used in this study The metagenomic samples from the Caspian Sea were taken at the peak of stratification in October 2013 at three depths ( 15m, 40m and 150m, bottom depth 230m).

The two deep sea samples from the Mediterranean were collected in the Aegean Sea ( 600m, bottom depth 699m) and Ionian Sea ( 3500m, bottom depth 3633m) in October 2010.
