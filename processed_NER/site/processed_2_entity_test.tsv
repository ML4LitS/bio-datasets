On day 62 ( time point A) and day 177 ( time point B), all reactors were opened and the carbon substrate from the center of the reactors and the planktonic phase from between the wood chips were sampled.

Overall, field evidence suggests that hyperalkaline seepages are numerous and are active late in the baseflow period of perennial streams ( December to April).

To investigate potential sources of the microorganisms in the cryoconite holes we also collected a total of eleven samples from different surface habitats nearby for DNA sequencing.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Sampling and physiochemical measurements Benthic mat samples were collected on 26 June 2012 at 16: 00 PDT ( photon flux 490 mol photons PAR m2 s1; due to partial cloudiness) and 27 June 2012 at 01: 00 PDT ( photon flux 0 mol photons PAR m2 s1) and at 16: 00 PDT ( photon flux 1225 mol photon PAR m2 s1) from a water depth of 3540cm located in northeastern Washington state ( USA) ( 48. 97347119. 476322).

Spring samples were collected according to following criteria: evidence of continuous water flow from the rock, close to bubbling zones, and near the most reductive point.

SourceTracker ( v. 0. 9. 5) [ 26] was used to predict the source of the bacterial and eukaryotic communities using the cryoconite hole samples as sinks and lake, soil, endolith and snow samples as potential sources of microbial inputs.
