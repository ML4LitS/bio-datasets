One sample ( E215m - 2014 _ f, obtained during 2014 from 215m depth in borehole 08E140C01) was collected by passage of the 0. 22m filtrate through a 10000 nominal molecular weight limit filter ( type PLGC; Merck Millipore).

For comparison, we also collected one barite - rich silica chimney ( SiCh) from the extinct vent area ( Figure 1G) at 7333. 99N and 0809. 58E at a water depth of 2367 m. An overview of examined mat - samples and chimney sub - samples, respectively, are given in Table 1.

Metabolic Potential of As - yet - uncultured Archaeal Lineages of Candidatus Hydrothermarchaeota Thriving in Deep - sea Metal Sulfide Deposits Candidatus Hydrothermarchaeota, formally called Marine Benthic Group E, has often been detected in iron - and sulfur - rich marine environments, such as hydrothermal vents and cold seeps.
