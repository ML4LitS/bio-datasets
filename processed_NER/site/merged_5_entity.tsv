To get an overview of the distribution of 16S rRNA reads assigned to Chloroflexi across the global ocean, in addition to the Mediterranean ( DCM and Deep), Caspian [ 32] and MALASPINA [ 36] datasets, we also used surface, DCM and mesopelagic datasets generated by the TARA expedition [ 37].

Methods Sediment core sample In 2012, the IODP Expedition 337 Deep Coalbed Biosphere off Shimokita was conducted at approximately 80km offshore the Shimokita Peninsula, Japan, in the northwestern Pacific using the deep - sea drilling vessel Chikyu at Site C0020 ( 4110. 5983N, 14212. 0328E, 1180m water depth).

Material and methods Metagenomic datasets used in this study The metagenomic samples from the Caspian Sea were taken at the peak of stratification in October 2013 at three depths ( 15m, 40m and 150m, bottom depth 230m).	peak of stratification,124,146,site	15m,181,184,site	40m,186,189,site	150m,194,198,site	bottom depth 230m,200,217,site	"[{""token"": ""peak of stratification"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""site""}, {""token"": ""15m"", ""start_span"": 181, ""end_span"": 184, ""type"": ""site""}, {""token"": ""40m"", ""start_span"": 186, ""end_span"": 189, ""type"": ""site""}, {""token"": ""150m"", ""start_span"": 194, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""site""}, {""token"": ""bottom depth 230m"", ""start_span"": 200, ""end_span"": 217, ""type"": ""site""}]"	train
The two deep sea samples from the Mediterranean were collected in the Aegean Sea ( 600m, bottom depth 699m) and Ionian Sea ( 3500m, bottom depth 3633m) in October 2010.	deep,8,12,site	600m,83,87,site	bottom depth 699m,89,106,site	3500m,125,130,site	bottom depth 3633m,132,150,site	"[{""token"": ""deep"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""site""}, {""token"": ""600m"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""site""}, {""token"": ""bottom depth 699m"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""site""}, {""token"": ""3500m"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""site""}, {""token"": ""bottom depth 3633m"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""site""}]"	train
