We present evidence that apoptosis of caspase - 3 - deficient MCF - 7 breast cancer cells is defective in response to cisplatin treatment, as determined by chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation, DNA fragmentation, and release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria.	chromatin,156,165,Cellular_component	nuclear,180,187,Cellular_component	DNA,203,206,Cellular_component	mitochondria,259,271,Cellular_component	"[{""token"": ""chromatin"", ""start_span"": 156, ""end_span"": 165, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 180, ""end_span"": 187, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""DNA"", ""start_span"": 203, ""end_span"": 206, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""mitochondria"", ""start_span"": 259, ""end_span"": 271, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}]"	train
Serum deprivation - induced apoptosis of BHK ( + TF) cells was characterized by apoptotic blebs, nuclei with chromatin - condensed bodies, DNA degradation, and activation of caspase 3.	blebs,90,95,Cellular_component	nuclei,97,103,Cellular_component	chromatin,109,118,Cellular_component	DNA,139,142,Cellular_component	"[{""token"": ""blebs"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""nuclei"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""chromatin"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""DNA"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}]"	valid
Here, we discuss the possibility for MMPs to contribute to pericyte recruitment at six levels: ( 1) direct promotion of pericyte invasion by extracellular matrix degradation; ( 2) stimulation of pericyte proliferation and protection against apoptosis by modification of the ECM; ( 3) activation of pericytes through the release of growth factor bound to the ECM; ( 4) transactivation of angiogenic cell surface receptor; ( 5) propagation of angiogenic signalling as cofactor; and ( 6) recruitment of bone marrow - derived stem cells.	extracellular matrix,141,161,Cellular_component	ECM,274,277,Cellular_component	ECM,358,361,Cellular_component	cell surface,398,410,Cellular_component	"[{""token"": ""extracellular matrix"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""ECM"", ""start_span"": 274, ""end_span"": 277, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""ECM"", ""start_span"": 358, ""end_span"": 361, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""cell surface"", ""start_span"": 398, ""end_span"": 410, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}]"	test
The resultant tumors display lumen - like morphology, contain carcinoma - like focal areas with intercellular junctions resembling desmosomes, and coexpress epithelial ( cytokeratin) and mesenchymal ( vimentin) cytoskeletal markers.	focal areas,79,90,Cellular_component	intercellular junctions,96,119,Cellular_component	desmosomes,131,141,Cellular_component	cytoskeletal,211,223,Cellular_component	"[{""token"": ""focal areas"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""intercellular junctions"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""desmosomes"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""cytoskeletal"", ""start_span"": 211, ""end_span"": 223, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}]"	test
