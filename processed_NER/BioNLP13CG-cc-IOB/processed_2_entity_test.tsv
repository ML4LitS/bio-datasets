These antivascular actions are due in part to direct effects on endothelial cells, and all MBDs ( both microtubule - stabilizing and microtubule - destabilizing) inhibit endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation in vitro, actions that are thought to correspond to therapeutic antiangiogenic actions.
