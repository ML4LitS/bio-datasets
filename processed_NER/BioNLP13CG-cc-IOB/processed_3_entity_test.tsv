Tumor - specific DNA changes were detected in two additional HCCs, suggesting that the small region of chromosome 17p defined by the flanking cell DNA probe is commonly altered in hepatomas.

Furthermore, it was shown that thiol - containing antioxidants completely blocked MOG - induced mitochondrial DeltaPsim loss and subsequent cell apoptosis, while the inhibition of apoptosis by benzyloxy - carbonyl - Val - Ala - Asp - fluoromethylketone only partially attenuated mitochondrial DeltaPsim loss, indicating that MOG - induced redox imbalance is an early event upstream to mitochondrial DeltaPsim loss and caspase - 3 activation.

The effects on endothelial cells occur in vitro at low drug concentrations, which do not affect microtubule gross morphology, do not cause microtubule bundling or microtubule loss and do not induce cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, or cell death.
