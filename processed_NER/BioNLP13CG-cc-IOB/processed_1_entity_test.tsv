The present work supports and extends the finding of previous studies, since the results showed that the glucose metabolism depressed the oxidative processes in Ehrlich ascites tumor mitochondria, not only alone, but also in the presence of glutamine.

Transformation of BHK hamster fibroblasts by an env - strain of Rous sarcoma virus ( RSV) leads to the appearance at the cell surface of a virus - induced nonvirion antigen ( VCSA), specific for transformation, whose expression is controlled by the transforming src gene.

Similar translocations are found in mouse plasmacytomas and both diseases involve interchanges between one of the immunoglobulin loci and DNA in the vicinity of the myc gene.

Simultaneously as the growth rate decreased, the cellular uptake of glucose and the density of a class of glucose - reversible binding sites for cytochalasin B on the cell surface were also found to be reduced.

Treatment of murine pulmonary capillary endothelial cells with HAH - cortisol at 10 ( - 5) M ( with respect to cortisol) suppressed their DNA synthesis by 50% and inhibited their migration into wounded areas of confluent monolayers.

HAH - cortisol at 10 ( - 4) M ( with respect to cortisol) did not suppress the DNA synthesis of Lewis lung carcinoma cells.	"DNA	79	82	Cellular_component"	"[{""token"": ""DNA"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}]"
The antiproliferative effect of HAH - cortisol on endothelial cells appeared independent of the glucocorticoid activity of the steroid since HAH conjugated to 5 beta - pregnane - 3 alpha, 17 alpha, 21 - triol - 20 - one, a steroid lacking glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid activity, was even more effective at inhibiting DNA synthesis by murine pulmonary capillary endothelial cells than was HAH - cortisol.

When goldfish erythrophores isolated from the skin by tissue digestion and centrifugation in a Percoll density gradient were transfected in a monolayer - culture with v - Ha - ras or v - src oncogene either singly or in combination with v - myc by means of calcium phosphate - DNA co - precipitation, there appeared a certain number of transformants manifesting a chromatoblast - like profile and tumorous phenotypes as seen in the capability for unlimited growth, and piling - up in a monolayer - culture or colony formation in semi - solid soft agar.

Little difference was observed in their transforming efficiency ( 0. 2 - 0. 3 transformants / micrograms DNA) between the combinations of oncogenes applied but a tendency was noted that cells transfected with ras or src in combination with myc developed the capacity to grow for a longer period and differentiated at a later stage than those transfected solely with ras or src.

Patterns of X - chromosome inactivation, mutations in the K - ras gene, mutations or allelic loss of the p53 gene, or human papillomavirus detection were identical in both endometrial and ovarian lesions in three of the cases suggesting that those three cases represented single primary tumors with metastases.
