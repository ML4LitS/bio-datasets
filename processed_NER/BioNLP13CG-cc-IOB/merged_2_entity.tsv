In our study, MOG was shown to specifically inhibit the growth of human leukemia cell lines and primary acute myeloid leukemia ( AML) blasts via induction of apoptosis, with the evidence of mitochondrial DeltaPsim loss, reactive oxygen species production, caspases activation and nuclear fragmentation.	mitochondrial,190,203,Cellular_component	nuclear,280,287,Cellular_component	"[{""token"": ""mitochondrial"", ""start_span"": 190, ""end_span"": 203, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 280, ""end_span"": 287, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}]"	test
These antivascular actions are due in part to direct effects on endothelial cells, and all MBDs ( both microtubule - stabilizing and microtubule - destabilizing) inhibit endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation in vitro, actions that are thought to correspond to therapeutic antiangiogenic actions.	microtubule,103,114,Cellular_component	microtubule,133,144,Cellular_component	"[{""token"": ""microtubule"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""microtubule"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}]"	test
