Apoptosis, characterized by nuclear condensation, membrane blebbing, cell shrinkage and a significant induction of caspase - 3 - like protease activity at 8 h in a time - course study were observed.	"nuclear	28	35	Cellular_component"	"membrane	50	58	Cellular_component"	"[{""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""membrane"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}]"
Activated Hck and membrane - anchored Cbl are present in similar subcellular localizations and co - immunoprecipitate, suggesting that their interaction is required for subsequent ubiquitination and degradation.	"membrane	18	26	Cellular_component"	"subcellular	65	76	Cellular_component"	"[{""token"": ""membrane"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""subcellular"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}]"
Adaptor protein Crk is required for ephrin - B1 - induced membrane ruffling and focal complex assembly of human aortic endothelial cells.	"membrane	58	66	Cellular_component"	"focal complex	80	93	Cellular_component"	"[{""token"": ""membrane"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""focal complex"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}]"
We investigated the mechanism by which ephrin - B1 promotes membrane ruffling in human aortic endothelial cells, because membrane ruffling heralds cell body migration.	"membrane	60	68	Cellular_component"	"membrane	121	129	Cellular_component"	"[{""token"": ""membrane"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""membrane"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}]"
The dominant negative mutant of Rac1 completely inhibited ephrin - B1 - induced membrane ruffling and focal complex assembly.	"membrane	80	88	Cellular_component"	"focal complex	102	115	Cellular_component"	"[{""token"": ""membrane"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""focal complex"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}]"
However, in rap1GAPII - expressing cells, ephrin - B1 did not induce membrane spreading, probably due to instability of the focal complex.	"membrane	69	77	Cellular_component"	"focal complex	124	137	Cellular_component"	"[{""token"": ""membrane"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""focal complex"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}]"
These results indicated that Crk plays a critical role in Rac1 - induced membrane ruffling and Rap1 - mediated nascent focal complex stabilization contributing to ephrin - B1 - induced human aortic endothelial cells migration.

Then, we demonstrated a mitochondrial membrane potential disruption followed by cytochrome c release that indicates the involvement of mitochondria in this apoptotic signaling pathway.

Concomitantly, immunostaining for apoptosis inducing factor ( AIF) showed a time - dependent translocation from the mitochondria to the nucleus.

Antibodies against beta ( 2) M or MHC class I induce tumor cell apoptosis by 1) recruiting MHC class I molecules to lipid rafts and activating LYN kinase and the signal - transducing enzyme phospholipase C - gamma2 - dependent c - Jun N - terminal kinase signaling pathway and 2) expelling interleukin 6 and insulin - like growth factor 1 receptors out of lipid rafts and inhibiting the growth and survival factor - induced activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase / Akt and extracellular signal - related kinase pathways.

Each consists of repetitive cycles of interaction with adjacent extracellular matrix components by mediating cellular adhesion, matrix dissolution, and cellular motility to achieve metastasis of cancer cells or neovascularization of tumors.

Syndecan - 1 is a cell surface proteoglycan that has been implicated in a number of cellular functions including cell - cell adhesion, cell - matrix anchorage and growth factor presentation for signalling receptors.
