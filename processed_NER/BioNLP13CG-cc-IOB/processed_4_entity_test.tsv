Here, we discuss the possibility for MMPs to contribute to pericyte recruitment at six levels: ( 1) direct promotion of pericyte invasion by extracellular matrix degradation; ( 2) stimulation of pericyte proliferation and protection against apoptosis by modification of the ECM; ( 3) activation of pericytes through the release of growth factor bound to the ECM; ( 4) transactivation of angiogenic cell surface receptor; ( 5) propagation of angiogenic signalling as cofactor; and ( 6) recruitment of bone marrow - derived stem cells.

The resultant tumors display lumen - like morphology, contain carcinoma - like focal areas with intercellular junctions resembling desmosomes, and coexpress epithelial ( cytokeratin) and mesenchymal ( vimentin) cytoskeletal markers.
