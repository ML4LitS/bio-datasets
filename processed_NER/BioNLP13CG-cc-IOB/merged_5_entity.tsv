Rather, it has been hypothesized that, at low concentrations, MBDs produce more subtle effects on microtubule dynamics, block critical cell signaling pathways, and prevent the microtubules from properly interacting with transient subcellular assemblies ( focal adhesions and adherens junctions) whose subsequent stabilization and / or maturation are required for cell motility and cell - cell interactions.	microtubule,98,109,Cellular_component	microtubules,176,188,Cellular_component	subcellular assemblies,230,252,Cellular_component	focal adhesions,255,270,Cellular_component	adherens junctions,275,293,Cellular_component	"[{""token"": ""microtubule"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""microtubules"", ""start_span"": 176, ""end_span"": 188, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""subcellular assemblies"", ""start_span"": 230, ""end_span"": 252, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""focal adhesions"", ""start_span"": 255, ""end_span"": 270, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}, {""token"": ""adherens junctions"", ""start_span"": 275, ""end_span"": 293, ""type"": ""Cellular_component""}]"	test
