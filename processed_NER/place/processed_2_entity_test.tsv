Group II This group of four lakes follows the current of the main chain of lakes and includes the largest and deepest lake of the Osterseen Lake District, Lake Grosser Ostersee, which is 2. 15 km long and 0. 83 km wide with a maximum depth of 29 m. The lakes in this group are less influenced by groundwater sources.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Sampling and physiochemical measurements Benthic mat samples were collected on 26 June 2012 at 16: 00 PDT ( photon flux 490 mol photons PAR m2 s1; due to partial cloudiness) and 27 June 2012 at 01: 00 PDT ( photon flux 0 mol photons PAR m2 s1) and at 16: 00 PDT ( photon flux 1225 mol photon PAR m2 s1) from a water depth of 3540cm located in northeastern Washington state ( USA) ( 48. 97347119. 476322).

Sequences analyzed in a previous study of the microbial diversity of Mono Lake by Humayoun et al. ( 2003), who sampled different depths from the same redox zones at Station 6 ( 2 m, aerobic; 17. 5 m, microaerophilic, 23 m, anoxic; and 35 m, sulfidic, see Humayoun et al., 2003), were downloaded from NCBI GenBank ( n = 274).
