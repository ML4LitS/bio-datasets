The expression levels of hilA and invF were previously shown to be affected by both HilC and HilD ( 8, 9, 16) but since hilC levels are unaffected by the mlc mutation ( Figure 2A) we speculated that Mlc was regulating hilA and invF expression indirectly probably by modulating the expression of hilD or the higher regulator of hilD.
