Based on its downregulation during adherence, we infer that slo was transcribed during pre - adherence associations, perhaps, as previously reported, to protect streptococci from phagocytic killing in vivo [ 27].

Although few studies have examined gene expression patterns during adherence, SpeB production ( as detected by Western blot analysis) decreases during co - culture with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells [ 30] and in a mouse infection model [ 31].

We observed significant upregulation of the gene spy0130, encoding a protein recently found to be associated with the production of surface - exposed pili on strain SF370 [ 36].	"spy0130	49	56	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""spy0130"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The protein shares 60% sequence similarity to protein F, suggesting that it may coordinate a similar internalization mechanism or may be involved directly in adherence ( discussed later in detail).	"protein F	46	55	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""protein F"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
SpeB downregulation also coincides with increased expression of pyrogenic exotoxins [ 33, 37] that reportedly increase streptococcal survival in vivo.	"SpeB	0	4	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SpeB"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Taken together, our results agree with previous reports on SpeB production during host cell interactions, suggesting that decreased expression may promote streptococcal adherence ( by preventing proteolytic degradation of key virulence factors or adhesins), enhance internalization ( perhaps through a fibronectin - mediated pathway), and increase survival ( through increased pyrogenic exotoxin production, discussed below).

Adherence - mediated upregulation of speH is likely not the result of phage induction, as the remaining phage 370. 2 genes identified in our analysis were downregulated.	"speH	37	41	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""speH"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We observed no significant difference in adherence between the wild - type ( SF370) and mutant strains ( Figure 1B), indicating that SpeH is not involved directly in attachment to the pharyngeal cell.

Adherence - induced downregulation of streptolysin S is consistent with its previously determined role in host cell internalization [ 25]; however, without neighbor clustering, expression of this operon was not evident immediately.

If transcription is internally disrupted by such a terminator, the abundance of the sagA transcript may be much greater than the polycistronic message; such disproportionate transcript levels would affect log2 - fold change values and impact the statistical significance of individual genes within these types of clusters.

A search of both the PFAM database [ 47] ( http: / / pfam. wustl. edu) and sortase database ( http: / / www. doe - mbi. ucla. edu / Services / Sortase) predicted that spy0129 encodes a sortase enzyme, which are transpeptidases that cleave protein substrates at conserved C - terminal motifs ( often LPXTG) and then anchor these proteins to the bacterial cell wall [ 48, 49].

Because the gene cluster is also an operon, expression of the downstream gene spy0130, encoding the protein F homolog / pilus protein, was also eliminated in this mutant ( Figure 4A).	"spy0130	78	85	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""spy0130"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In vitro pharyngeal cell adherence assays revealed that the SF370Deltaspy0129. 2 mutant was approximately 66% less adherent than the parental control strain, SF370 ( Figure 4B; p = 0. 03 as determined by the Student ' s t - test).

Because the spy0129 gene product is not expected to be found on the streptococcal surface ( i. e., it lacks a cell - wall anchoring motif), it is not likely to be involved directly in adherence.

The FimA protein is required for P. gingivalis colonization on salivary coated surfaces, and the early colonization of dental plaque ( Malek et al., 1994; Levesque et al., 2003; Maeda et al., 2004).	"FimA	4	8	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FimA"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Earlier studies by the authors showed that FimA expression was modulated by environmental cues, including temperature and hemin concentration, and by the presence of Streptococcus cristatus, an early colonizer of dental plaque ( Xie et al., 1997, 2000b).	"FimA	43	47	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FimA"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Identification of the transcriptional start site of the mfa1 gene	"mfa1	56	60	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""mfa1"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To identify the promoter region of mfa1, the transcriptional start site was first determined.	"mfa1	35	39	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""mfa1"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The RACE experiment was first conducted with mfa1 - specific reverse primers MfaTSR1 located at 135 bp up - stream of the potential start codon and MfaTSR2 located at 37 bp downstream of the potential start codon ( Fig. 2a).	"mfa1	45	49	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""mfa1"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The transcriptional start site ( the A) of mfa1 was at 434 bp upstream from the potential start codon ( Fig. 2b).	"mfa1	43	47	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""mfa1"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To verify the result, the RACE experiment was repeated with mfa1 - specific reverse primers MfaTSR3 and MfaTSR4 located at 237 bp upstream of the potential start codon.	"mfa1	60	64	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""mfa1"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Cold competitor chase experiments with a 100 - fold excess of unlabeled DNA probe as a specific competitor were also used to demonstrate the specificity of rFimR binding.	"rFimR	156	161	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""rFimR"", ""start_span"": 156, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
EMSA experiments were also performed to examine whether the rFimR binds to the other promoter region identified by Park et al.	"rFimR	60	65	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""rFimR"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, the possibility cannot be excluded that other regulatory elements are also involved in expression of the mfa1 gene.	"mfa1	114	118	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""mfa1"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, no apparent difference was found in DNA - binding affinity between rFimRs with or without acetyl phosphate treatment.	"rFimRs	76	82	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""rFimRs"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

The fact that FimR was not activated by phosphorylation may also be due to the short lifetime of the phosphorylated state, which has been observed in other bacteria ( Stock et al., 2000).	"FimR	14	18	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FimR"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The transcriptional start site of the mfa1 gene located at 434 bp upstream of the putative start codon was detected, which is also 390 bp upstream of the site previously reported ( Park et al., 2006).	"mfa1	38	42	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""mfa1"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Data of this study suggest that transcription of the mfa1 gene originated at a distal upstream transcriptional start site and read through the promoter region suggested by Park et al.	"mfa1	53	57	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""mfa1"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Two promoter regions in the P. gingivalis fimA gene were also reported ( Xie & Lamont, 1999; Nishikawa et al., 2004).	"fimA	42	46	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""fimA"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
A cascade regulation starting with FimR appears to act on the upstream promoter ( Nishikawa et al., 2004).	"FimR	35	39	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FimR"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It is possible that two promoters of mfa1 are regulated in response to different environmental signals.	"mfa1	37	41	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""mfa1"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, it is proposed that FimR can be an attractive target for inhibition of P. gingivalis colonization.	"FimR	31	35	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FimR"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We were particularly interested in a C to T mutation responsible for the serine to leucine replacement at position 219, S219L, of the two - component regulator PhoP as this protein is well known for its involvement in the virulent phenotype of M. tuberculosis [ 14].	"PhoP	160	164	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PhoP"", ""start_span"": 160, ""end_span"": 164, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Importantly, on inspection of the structure of the PhoP - ortholog from Bacillus subtilis, it was found that the equivalent residue Ser 207 is a main residue in the DNA - binding domain, helix alpha3 [ 15].	"PhoP	51	55	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PhoP"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Nevertheless, the S129L mutation in PhoP, which we consider an important SNP involved in the attenuation and reduced immunogenicity of H37Ra, is identical in all H37Ra strains.	"PhoP	36	40	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PhoP"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Figure S1 shows part of the nucleotide sequence of a PCR - amplified fragment obtained from H37Ra:: phoP.	"phoP	100	104	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
From these experiments we concluded that complementation of H37Ra with the phoP wild - type copy partially restored its virulence, but not to the extent of the fully virulent H37Rv strain.	"phoP	75	79	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, as already observed in macrophages, integration of phoP did not restore levels of virulence to those of the reference strain H37Rv ( Figure 2).	"phoP	60	64	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Together with the data from the macrophage infection assay, the results from the mouse infection show that the S219L mutation in the phoP gene definitely represents one genetic lesion that contributed to the attenuation of the H37Ra strain.

As anticipated, all tested strains induced IFN - gamma production in response to purified protein derivative ( PPD) but not to a control peptide ( Mal - E), indicating successful vaccination ( Figure 3).

Exactly the same trend was observed when a highly sensitive T cell hybridoma assay was used to investigate ESAT - 6 secretion.	"ESAT - 6	107	115	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This test is based on the presentation of the immunodominant epitope contained in the first 20 amino acids of ESAT - 6 by H37Ra, recombinant H37Ra, or H37Rv infected bone marrow - derived dendritic cells ( BM - DC) to an ESAT - 6 - specific T cell hybridoma ( NB11), restricted by I - Ab.

All strains behaved comparably towards the Ag85A: 241 - 260 control, emphasizing the specificity of the observed phenomenon for ESAT - 6 ( Figure 4B).	"ESAT - 6	128	136	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To further evaluate the involvement of phoP and the ESX - 1 system in immunogenicity, C57BL / 6 mice were vaccinated with additional strains.	"phoP	39	43	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Secondly, we also tested the previously described M. tuberculosis MT103 phoP knock - out ( ko) strain SO2 [ 14, 25] in this assay and found that this strain induced a potent PPD response as previously reported [ 25].	"phoP	72	76	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Similar results were obtained for H37Ra:: fadE5 ( unpublished data).	"fadE5	42	47	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""fadE5"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In a previous report [ 25], the presence of ESAT - 6 in cell free extracts was described for this strain, but no secretion assay was performed.	"ESAT - 6	44	52	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Interestingly, expression of phoP was higher in H37Ra than in H37Rv ( Figure 6).	"phoP	29	33	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
That study identified 44 genes in the phoP - ko strain that were expressed at least 2. 5 - fold lower in the mutant than their counterparts in the M. tuberculosis wild - type strain.	"phoP	38	42	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As in previous DNA / DNA microarray analyses [ 10], and from inspection of the very recently released genome sequence of H37Ra, no significant differences in the ESX - 1 encoding region were found, the assumption that the observed lack of ESAT - 6 secretion in H37Ra may be caused by factors outside of the RD1 region is very plausible.	"ESAT - 6	239	247	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 239, ""end_span"": 247, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In contrast, in another transcriptome analysis, Mostowy and colleagues [ 11] found several genes of the RD1 region, including that encoding ESAT - 6, among the genes that were at least 2. 5 - fold lower expressed in H37Ra than in H37Rv.

In conclusion, in this work we report the identification and profound consequences of the PhoP S219L mutation on the widely used H37Ra strain.	"PhoP	90	94	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PhoP"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
BLASTP comparisons of the PhoP sequence showed that the predicted DNA binding region, where the mutation occurred, is perfectly conserved among a wide range of actinobacteria, with H37Ra being the only strain showing such a mutation.	"PhoP	26	30	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PhoP"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
With its well documented role in virulence and strong T cell antigenicity, ESAT - 6 is one of the most important proteins of M. tuberculosis involved in host pathogen interaction [ 5, 41 - 43].	"ESAT - 6	75	83	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, as previously observed in complementation studies of BCG [ 18], the level of virulence displayed by the phoP complemented H37Ra strain was still substantially below that of wild - type H37Rv, arguing that the strong attenuation of the H37Ra strain is likely based on several different genetic lesions, such as the one responsible for the absence of phthiocerol dimycocerosates ( PDIM) [ 29], that were probably introduced into this strain during years of continued culture following the original event of attenuation described by Steenken et al. in 1934 [ 6].	"phoP	113	117	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Finally, it is intriguing that both BCG and H37Ra, the two most often used attenuated tubercle bacilli, are attenuated for reasons linked to loss of ESAT - 6 functions.	"ESAT - 6	149	157	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 149, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Furthermore, PhoP has also been found to be important for virulence of Y. pestis [ 32], but its function in Y. enterocolitica during its insect - associated phase remains hypothetical.	"PhoP	13	17	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PhoP"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
They produce membrane diffusible signalling molecules, acyl homoserine lactones ( AHLs), which are sensed by the receptor / regulator LuxR when exceeding a threshold concentration.	"LuxR	134	138	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LuxR"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Upon autoinductor - binding, the receptor LuxR binds to the promoter / operator regions of the target genes or operons, resulting in the regulation of gene expression in response to the cell number [ 33].

One such mechanism is based upon modification of phospholipids in the cytoplasmic membrane by introducing a positively charged lysyl group into anionic phosphatidylglycerol by the MprF protein, thereby neutralizing the net charge of the membrane surface [ 11, 12].

In a S. aureus SA113 graRS deletion mutant, the content of D - alanine in teichoic acids was reduced by 47% and the mutant showed reduced resistance to various antibiotics including polymyxin B, gallidermin, and vancomycin [ 10, 13].

As the dlt operon plays a key role in S. aureus resistance to cationic antimicrobial host molecules, the graRS system may be important in evasion of host defense mechanisms such as cationic antimicrobial peptides and neutrophil killing.

Therefore, emm49 GAS isolated from invasive infections seems to acquire the novel or altered virulence factors by mutations, genomic additions, or deletions.	"emm49	11	16	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""emm49"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In the present study, we aimed to explore the crucial factors in the pathogenesis of severe invasive GAS infections in the context of PMN - GAS relationship, using a panel of emm49 clinical isolates from patients with or without severe invasive infection, and their gene - manipulated mutants.

As a model of local infection of the initial phase, we utilized a transwell system and added IL - 8 and GAS in culture medium within the lower wells.	"IL - 8	93	99	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 8"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As shown in Figure 2A and 2B, a substantial number of PMN, consisted largely of viable cells, was detected in the lower wells consisted of IL - 8 and non - invasive GAS, as a control.	"IL - 8	139	145	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 8"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Flow cytometry analysis suggested that although PMN was detected in the lower well consisted of IL - 8 and severe invasive GAS, but most of them were dead as defined by propidium iodine staining ( p = 0. 016) ( Figure 2A and 2C) demonstrating that severe invasive GAS affected survival of PMN and its migration activity in a transwell system.	"IL - 8	96	102	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 8"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
PMN death was induced shortly after encounter with severe invasive GAS, and PMN were not in apoptotic death because of low frequency of cells positive for annexin V ( data not shown), which was seen in the case of cytolysin - dependent cell injury [ 15].	"annexin V	155	164	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""annexin V"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 164, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, to know the mechanism underlying GAS - mediated killing of PMN, we investigated whether SLO produced by invasive GAS affect survival of PMN in an in vitro migration assay system.	"SLO	99	102	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SLO"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Figure 3A shows that PMN killing by invasive GAS was blocked by anti - SLO Ab in culture medium within lower wells of a transwell system ( p = 0. 018 compared with control Ig), at similar extent by adding free cholesterol in the medium ( data not shown).	"SLO	71	74	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SLO"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As shown in Figure 3B, incubation of PMN with supernatant from co - culture of IL - 8 and invasive or non - invasive GAS did not affect PMN viability, suggesting that severe invasive GAS causes PMN killing following encounter with bacteria in a contact - dependent manner.	"IL - 8	79	85	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 8"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As shown in Figure 3C, SLO activity of severe invasive isolate NIH230 is increased as twice as that of non - invasive strain 1566 ( p = 0. 017).	"SLO	23	26	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SLO"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, we quantified the amount of IL - 8 in culture before and after co - culture with clinically isolated GAS or its mutants.	"IL - 8	39	45	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 8"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, as shown in Figure 5B, the csrS genes of all clinically isolated severe invasive GAS had a deletion, a point mutation, or an insertion, thereby, resulting in the creation of translational stop codons ( NIH147, NIH226, NIH230, and NIH269) or in a mutation in the presumed kinase domain ( NIH200).

In contrast, the expression of speB was upregulated to the level observed in the non - invasive GAS ( Figure 5A).	"speB	31	35	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""speB"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Contrarily, no significant pathological alterations were observed in the mice injected with the 1566 and NIH230:: csrS + strains ( Figure 7B and 7C).	"csrS +	114	120	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""csrS +"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Figure 7D shows that subcutaneous infection of NIH230 formed the infected lesions with area significantly larger than those of 1566 and NIH230:: csrS +.	"csrS +	145	151	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""csrS +"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These results suggest that the invasive GAS isolates are more virulent in vivo than non - invasive GAS, and impair PMN function in vivo, owing, at least in part, to the mutations in the csrS gene.	"csrS	186	190	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""csrS"", ""start_span"": 186, ""end_span"": 190, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

However, we confirmed that addition of DNase in the culture did not alter the level of PI - positive PMN, meaning bright PI staining of PMN is not due to release of NETs from PMN ( Figure S1A).	"DNase	39	44	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DNase"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

In the present study, we observed that SLO concentration in a short - time culture with severe invasive GAS did not reach the threshold level to kill PMN by formation of pores ( data not shown) and that PMN did not undergo necrosis upon incubation with culture media of severe invasive GAS ( Figure 3B), leading to the novel possibility that PMN are probably killed following encounter with invasive GAS in a contact - dependent manner.	"SLO	39	42	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SLO"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
PMN - binding GAS may make a small interface containing a high concentration of SLO between bacteria and PMN, which resembles to killing mechanism of killer cells to target cells [ 30].	"SLO	80	83	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SLO"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Addition of excess Mg2 + ( 5 mM) to the growth medium completely repressed the expression of PA3553 in cultures supplemented with DNA, except at the highest DNA concentration tested ( 0. 5% ( w / v)) ( Fig 4B).

At sub - lethal concentrations, extracellular DNA imposes a cation limitation that leads to induction of PA3553 ( Fig 4A), which can be repressed by excess Mg2 + ( Fig 4B), indicating that P. aeruginosa senses Mg2 +.

As early as 20 days post - infection, the number of M. tuberculosis bacilli present in the lungs of Deltarv2623 - infected guinea pigs was approximately10 - fold higher ( p < 0. 05) than those infected with wildtype Erdman, and continued to rise, attaining a 15 - fold ( p < 0. 001) difference by 60 days post - infection ( Figure 3A).	"Deltarv2623	100	111	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Deltarv2623"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Guinea pigs are able to control the growth of Erdman bacilli following the onset of adaptive immunity at approximately3 weeks post - infection, as evident by the relatively stable pulmonary bacterial burden beyond the 3 week time point, yet levels of Deltarv2623 bacilli continued to increase at a reduced but steady rate resulting in a rapidly progressing infection.	"Deltarv2623	251	262	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Deltarv2623"", ""start_span"": 251, ""end_span"": 262, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Moreover, Deltarv2623 - infected guinea pigs were moribund at 60 days post - infection, while those challenged with wildtype Erdman remained relatively healthy, providing further evidence that the mutant strain is hypervirulent in this model.	"Deltarv2623	10	21	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Deltarv2623"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Also consistent with the fulminate disease progression displayed by Deltarv2623 - infected guinea pigs are the more severe pathological changes observed as early as 20 days post - infection in the lungs of these animals, as assessed by histopathological studies, including the semi - quantitative Total Lung Score analysis ( Figure 3B and Protocol S1).	"Deltarv2623	68	79	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Deltarv2623"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Overall, the progression of pulmonic lesions was accelerated in Deltarv2623 - infected animals compared to those infected with wildtype Erdman, accompanied by more extensive necrosis and widespread fibrosis.	"Deltarv2623	64	75	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Deltarv2623"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, the hypervirulence phenotype of Deltarv2623 observed in the susceptible guinea pig model could have been masked in the C57BL / 6 mice.	"Deltarv2623	38	49	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Deltarv2623"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Consequently, we examined the virulence of Deltarv2623 in the relatively susceptible C3H / HeJ mouse strain [ 24].	"Deltarv2623	43	54	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Deltarv2623"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In agreement with the survival data, quantification of tissue bacterial burden revealed a growth advantage for the Rv2623 - deficient mutant relative to wildtype M. tuberculosis Erdman ( Figure 4C).	"Rv2623	115	121	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rv2623"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Manifestation of this hypervirulence phenotype is apparent as early as 3 weeks post - infection, with the lung bacterial burden of mice infected with Deltarv2623 M. tuberculosis approximately100 fold higher than that in the wildtype - infected animals.	"Deltarv2623	150	161	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Deltarv2623"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Finally, survival of Deltarv2623 - infected mice was also significantly reduced in another susceptible mouse strain, C3HeB / FeJ ( Figure S1).	"Deltarv2623	21	32	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Deltarv2623"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Effects of environmental stress on growth of M. tuberculosis Deltarv2623 in vitro	"Deltarv2623	61	72	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Deltarv2623"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The growth kinetics and survival of the Deltarv2623 strain was examined under various stress conditions, including those likely to be present during M. tuberculosis infection.	"Deltarv2623	40	51	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Deltarv2623"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
M. tuberculosis Rv2623 is a nucleotide - binding protein	"Rv2623	16	22	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rv2623"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We began a biochemical characterization of Rv2623 in order to gain insight into the relationship between the molecular structure / function of this USP and it ' s growth - regulatory properties.	"Rv2623	43	49	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rv2623"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
M. tuberculosis Rv2623 was expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity for biochemical studies.	"Rv2623	16	22	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rv2623"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The nucleotide - binding capacity of a subset of USPs was discovered following the observation that MJ0577, a single - domain USP from Methanococcus jannaschii, co - purifies and co - crystallizes with ATP [ 26].	"MJ0577	100	106	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MJ0577"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The presence of this motif in each of the two tandem USP domains of Rv2623 [ 7] raised the possibility that this protein possesses ATP binding activity.	"Rv2623	68	74	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rv2623"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Measurement of the binding stoichiometry, which comprised HPLC - based quantification of adenine nucleotides from the boiled supernatant and spectral analysis of heat denatured Rv2623 following reconstitution in 6 M guanidine - HCl, yields 1. 4 + / - 0. 2 nucleotide equivalents / monomer with an overall content of 86 + / - 4% ATP ( 14 + / - 4% ADP).	"Rv2623	177	183	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rv2623"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 183, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, Rv2623 binds endogenous adenine nucleotides in E. coli, and the association is sufficiently tight that nearly 75% of the nucleotide binding sites are occupied upon purification.	"Rv2623	6	12	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rv2623"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It is conceivable that the presence of ADP is the consequence of an Rv2623 - associated ATP activity and this putative ATPase function is currently under investigation.	"Rv2623	68	74	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rv2623"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The crystal structure of M. tuberculosis Rv2623: Dimer assembly and ATP - binding capacity	"Rv2623	41	47	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rv2623"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Dimerization of Rv2623 occurs along a 2 - fold axis orthogonal to the intramonomer dyad and juxtaposes ATP binding pockets from opposing monomers ( Figure 6B).	"Rv2623	16	22	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rv2623"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Phylogenomic analysis places Rv2623 in a Uniprot / TrEMBL family ( Q5YVE7) of 370 tandem - domain USPs, and a 113 - member subfamily ( N631) that consists almost exclusively of actinobacterial representatives ( Text S1).	"Rv2623	29	35	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rv2623"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Structure - based sequence alignments of both Rv2623 domains with the N631 consensus suggest that domain 2, which exhibits significantly higher conservation than domain 1 across global and ATP - binding subfamily consensus sequences, represents the ancestral domain among ATP - binding USPs with tandem - type architectures.	"Rv2623	46	52	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rv2623"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Interestingly, the domain fold and interdomain organization observed for Rv2623 is broadly conserved: these features are shared among single domain USP structures, both monomeric and dimeric, that are presently represented within the PDB.	"Rv2623	73	79	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rv2623"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As this manuscript was under preparation, a second, lower resolution ( 3. 2 A) crystal form of Rv2623 ( PDB ID 2JAX) was released for public access.	"Rv2623	95	101	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rv2623"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Generation and analysis of ATP - binding - deficient Rv2623 mutants	"Rv2623	53	59	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rv2623"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Likewise, following an overnight incubation with [ alpha - 33P] ATP at 4degreesC, the amount of protein - bound radioactivity, which represented a very small fraction of the total ATP binding sites, was significantly less for the mutant proteins than wild - type Rv2623 ( data not shown).	"Rv2623	263	269	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rv2623"", ""start_span"": 263, ""end_span"": 269, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It is therefore likely that the D15E and G117A mutations produced local structural changes in the ATP binding loops that contributed directly to the reduced levels of bound ATP in comparing to wild - type Rv2623.	"Rv2623	205	211	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rv2623"", ""start_span"": 205, ""end_span"": 211, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The growth - regulating property of M. tuberculosis Rv2623 is dependent on its ability to bind ATP	"Rv2623	52	58	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rv2623"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Both the D15E and G117A mutant proteins were overexpressed in M. smegmatis mc2155 at levels equivalent to that of wild - type Rv2623 ( Figure S4).	"Rv2623	126	132	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rv2623"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As in the M. smegmatis studies, the results show that overexpression of Rv2623 in M. tuberculosis results in marked retardation of growth.	"Rv2623	72	78	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rv2623"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore, this growth attenuation is not observed in M. tuberculosis strains overexpressing the G117A or the D15E mutant Rv2623 ( Figure 8B).	"Rv2623	124	130	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rv2623"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Taken together, these data strongly suggest that the ability of Rv2623 to regulate growth of M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis is dependent on an ATP - dependent process.	"Rv2623	64	70	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rv2623"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The biological significance of the dormancy regulon has been underscored by in vitro studies of dosR mutants of BCG and M. tuberculosis, which demonstrated the requirement of this transcription factor for survival under hypoxic conditions [ 3], [ 33].	"dosR	96	100	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""dosR"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We studied the M. tuberculosis USP rv2623 because it is one of the most highly induced genes in the dormancy regulon when bacilli are subjected to hypoxia and nitrosative stress [ 3], [ 4], [ 5], [ 36], [ 37].	"rv2623	35	41	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""rv2623"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
More important, rv2623 was also shown to be up - regulated when the tubercle bacillus is internalized by human and mouse macrophages [ 10], [ 38] as well as in the lungs of mice with persistent M. tuberculosis infection [ 11].	"rv2623	16	22	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""rv2623"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These latter observations suggest that the induction of rv2623 may have biological relevance.	"rv2623	56	62	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""rv2623"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The precise mechanisms by which Rv2623 expression is regulated remain to be defined.	"Rv2623	32	38	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rv2623"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These results suggest that the regulation of Rv2623 is likely complex.	"Rv2623	45	51	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rv2623"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In certain experimental tuberculosis animal models, DosR deficiency has been associated with a hypervirulence phenotype [ 41].	"DosR	52	56	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DosR"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, DosR deficiency has also been reported to have no effect on M. tuberculosis virulence or to lead to an attenuated phenotype [ 42], [ 43].	"DosR	9	13	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DosR"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The discrepancies regarding M. tuberculosis virulence in these DosR studies are unclear, but could be due to differences in experimental systems employed.	"DosR	63	67	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DosR"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In the present study, an rv2623 knockout mutant of virulent M. tuberculosis Erdman fails to establish a chronic persistent infection, displaying a hypervirulent phenotype in susceptible hosts, as assessed by lung bacterial burden, histopathology, and mortality.	"rv2623	25	31	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""rv2623"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Results of the complementation studies indicate that the phenotype is Rv2623 - specific.	"Rv2623	70	76	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rv2623"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This growth - regulating phenomenon is echoed by the observation that ectopic overexpression of Rv2623 results in attenuation of mycobacterial growth.	"Rv2623	96	102	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rv2623"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Together, these data strongly suggest that the M. tuberculosis USP Rv2623 has the ability to regulate growth in vitro and in vivo, and is required for the establishment of a persistent infection.	"Rv2623	67	73	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rv2623"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
While the non - ATP - binding UspA homologs appear to play diverse roles in promoting survival under a variety of environmental insults [ 15], [ 49], [ 50], [ 51], the function ( s) of ATP - binding type USPs remain unclear [ 9].	"UspA	30	34	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""UspA"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Based on in silico analyses, Florczyk et al. classified Rv2623 as belonging to a novel class of ATPases [ 52], although formal evidence for ATP binding by this protein has not been reported.	"Rv2623	56	62	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rv2623"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, M. tuberculosis Rv2623 may serve the function of promoting mycobacterial transition into latency.	"Rv2623	22	28	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rv2623"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As a result, Rv2623 may contribute significantly to the propagation of the tubercle bacillus in the human host and the difficulties in eradicating tuberculosis.	"Rv2623	13	19	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rv2623"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Mechanistically, results of the mutagenesis studies have shown that Rv2623 regulates growth through ATP - dependent function.	"Rv2623	68	74	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rv2623"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Clearly, much remains to be learned regarding how the ATP - dependent function of Rv2623 contributes to growth regulation.	"Rv2623	82	88	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rv2623"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It has been proposed that a nucleotide - binding USP from M. jannaschii, MJ0577, whose ability to hydrolyze ATP is dependent on interaction with factor ( s) present in the cell extract of this hyperthermophile [ 26], functions as a molecular switch much like the Ras protein family, whose GTP hydrolysis ability is modulated by interaction with a number of regulatory proteins [ 53], [ 54], [ 55].	"MJ0577	73	79	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MJ0577"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It is therefore conceivable that M. tuberculosis Rv2623, as a component of the yet - to - be defined dormancy signaling pathway ( s), functions as a molecular switch by virtue of its ATP - binding and putative ATP - hydrolyzing properties, to mediate the establishment of tuberculous latency.	"Rv2623	49	55	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rv2623"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Elucidation of how ATP - binding and, potentially, the hydrolysis of ATP by Rv2623 regulate M. tuberculosis dormancy - signaling pathways will likely illuminate the mechanisms by which the tubercle bacillus establishes persistence.

We thus identified 48 proteins that were differentially phosphorylated at one or more biofilm developmental stage including elongation factors, ribosomal proteins, several enzymes including reductases and GMP synthase, sigma factor RpoD ( Suppl.

The majority of regulatory proteins found to be uniquely phosphorylated during planktonic growth were transcriptional regulators, while with the exception of PA2096, all regulatory proteins found to be phosphorylated during surface attached growth were identified as belonging to two - component systems ( TCS) ( Table 1).

BfiS is an unusual sensor that harbors a His kinase A domain typically found in two - component system ( TCS) sensor proteins, a Histidine kinase - like ATPase domain involved in autophosphorylation but also in protein dephosphorylation events, and a PAS signal receiver domain [ 53].

As shown in Table 1, the probable TCS regulatory protein PA5511 was phosphorylated following 72 hr of surface - associated growth.	"PA5511	57	63	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PA5511"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
PA5511 mutant biofilms grown for 144 hr lacked clusters and microcolonies typically found in wild type biofilms following 72 - 144 hr of growth ( Fig. 2A - B).	"PA5511	0	6	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PA5511"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 6, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, when placed in a PAO1 background ( PAO1 / pJN5511), overexpression of PA5511 resulted in biofilms composed of large microcolonies exceeding 250 microm in diameter ( compared to an average cluster diameter of 150 microm in P. aeruginosa PAO1, Fig. 2A, D).

However, a DeltagacS mutant showed 10 - fold reduced initial attachment compared to the wild type ( not shown), consistent with previous findings by Parkins and colleagues [ 65].	"DeltagacS	11	20	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltagacS"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore, for DeltamifR biofilms, the progression of biofilm formation was indistinguishable from wild type P. aeruginosa biofilm formation for the first 72 hr of growth.	"DeltamifR	17	26	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltamifR"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, continued incubation did not result in increased DeltamifR biofilm growth ( biomass, thickness) or microcolony formation typically seen in wild type biofilms at the maturation - 2 stage ( post 72 hr of growth, Table 2, Fig. 2).

Closer inspection of biofilm formation by DeltagacS over a period of 144 hr, however, indicated that the biofilm architecture ( seen after 144 hr) was due to accelerated biofilm growth followed by premature disaggregation of biofilms as compared to wild type biofilms.	"DeltagacS	42	51	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltagacS"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
DeltagacS mutant biofilms were significantly thicker than wild type biofilms following 1 and 72 hr of growth under flowing conditions, forming microcolonies and clusters exceeding 150 microm in diameter ( Fig. 3).	"DeltagacS	0	9	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltagacS"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
At both time points, DeltagacS biofilms not only exceeded the average microcolony size typically seen for wild type biofilms of the same age, but also the biomass and thickness of wild type biofilms at more mature ages ( Fig. 3, Table 2).	"DeltagacS	21	30	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltagacS"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Continued growth for more than 72 hr, however, resulted in the disaggregation of DeltagacS mutant biofilms as indicated by the presence of large, detached clusters floating in the bulk liquid, and a significantly reduced attached biofilm biomass and biofilm thickness ( Fig. 3, Table 2).	"DeltagacS	81	90	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltagacS"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, while growth of DeltagacS mutant biofilms following 24 hr post attachment was accelerated ( Fig. 3), initial attachment was significantly reduced in this mutant ( not shown).	"DeltagacS	22	31	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltagacS"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In addition, both mutant biofilms lacked evidence for MifR phosphorylation ( phosphorylated following 72 hr of wild type growth, Table 1, Suppl. Fig. S3).	"MifR	54	58	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MifR"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Instead, DeltabfiS biofilms exhibited stage - specific phosphorylation events typically detected in 8 - hr - and 24 - hr - old wild type biofilms: the Ser / Thr phosphoproteome contained 15 out of 23 phosphorylated proteins and 2 out of 21 phosphorylated proteins that are specific for 8 - hr - and 24 - hr - old wild type biofilms, respectively ( see Fig. 1, Suppl. Table S2).	"DeltabfiS	9	18	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltabfiS"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Similarly, the phosphorylation patterns of DeltabfmR biofilms indicated the presence of 24 - and 72 - hr stage - specific phosphorylated proteins ( not shown).	"DeltabfmR	43	52	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltabfmR"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The phosphorylation patterns of 144 - hr - old DeltamifR biofilms were 62% different relative to planktonic cells, but only shared 58% similarity with mature, 144 - hr - old wild type biofilms ( Fig. 4A).	"DeltamifR	47	56	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltamifR"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore, DeltamifR biofilms exhibited 8 out of 27 maturation - 1 specific protein phosphorylation events, and only 16 out of 37 maturation - 2 phosphorylation events ( Suppl.

DeltabfiS biofilms were more similar to 24 - hr - old wild type biofilms than to wild type biofilms at more mature stages.	"DeltabfiS	0	9	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltabfiS"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Based on analyses of biofilm architecture, as well as of protein production and phosphorylation patterns, our findings indicate that DeltabfiS biofilms are arrested in the transition from reversible to the irreversible attachment stage ( 8 hr to 24 - hr - old biofilms, respectively).	"DeltabfiS	133	142	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltabfiS"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, BfiS - like sensory proteins with identities ranging between 28 - 68% were detected in a variety of Gram - negative bacteria, in particular in alpha -, beta -, and gamma - proteobacteria ( Suppl.

Similarly, BfmR homologues were detected among proteobacteria including Yersinia sp., Burkholderia sp., Rhizobium sp., Vibrio sp, Geobacter sp., and M. xanthus with identities ranging between 50 - 92% ( Suppl.

The preponderance of developmental promoters with sigma 54 hallmarks led to the suggestion that NtrC - like activators are key components of the transcriptional machinery that coordinates gene expression during M. xanthus development [ 72].

Using competitive infections in mice we show that SrcA increases bacterial fitness during host infection, highlighting the in vivo importance of effector chaperones for the SPI - 2 T3SS.	"SrcA	50	54	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SrcA"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This gene was also down regulated in Salmonella mutants lacking the SsrA sensor kinase [ 20], and was predicted to encode a possible chaperone in a bioinformatics - based screen [ 23].	"SsrA	68	72	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrA"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The predicted srcA gene product was a small protein approximately16 kDa with a pI of 4. 6, similar to secretion chaperones associated with T3SS.	"srcA	14	18	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""srcA"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In whole cell lysates, SrcA protein was reduced approximately10 - fold in DeltassrB cells compared to wild type ( Fig. 1B) and the protein was not detected in the secreted fraction from wild type cells ( Fig. 1C), consistent with the expected properties of a T3SS chaperone.

In comparative genomics analyses, srcA was found in all virulent strains of Salmonella enterica containing SPI - 2, but was absent from the cold - blooded animal commensal, S. bongori, which lacks SPI - 2 ( Table S1).	"srcA	34	38	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""srcA"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This suggested a co - evolution of srcA with the SPI - 2 T3SS and a possible functional relationship.	"srcA	35	39	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""srcA"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
If so, we reasoned that SrcA should contribute to animal colonization because the SPI - 2 T3SS is essential for host infection.	"SrcA	24	28	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SrcA"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
After three days of infection the geometric mean competitive index ( CI) for the mutant was 0. 20 ( 95% CI 0. 13 - 0. 29) and 0. 18 ( 95% CI 0. 06 - 0. 5) in the spleen and liver respectively ( P < 0. 0001; Fig. 1D) indicating that bacteria lacking srcA were significantly out competed by wild type cells during systemic infection.

Crystal structure of SrcA	"SrcA	21	25	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SrcA"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
SrcA crystallized in space group C2 with two molecules related by a 2 - fold symmetry axis in each asymmetric unit ( Fig. 2B).	"SrcA	0	4	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SrcA"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The dimer interface formed between SrcA monomers occurs primarily through reciprocal hydrophobic interactions between alpha2 and alpha2 ' with additional interface - stabilizing interactions occurring between the alpha2 helix of one monomer and beta4 and beta5 strands of the opposing monomer ( Fig. 2B).	"SrcA	35	39	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SrcA"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The total surface area buried at the dimer interface is 1258 A2, suggesting that SrcA would exist as a dimer in solution, which we confirmed by gel filtration analysis ( see below).	"SrcA	81	85	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SrcA"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

In SrcA, both extended and closely packed conformations are observed in separate subunits of the same dimer within the asymmetric unit.	"SrcA	3	7	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SrcA"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In the extended conformation the N - terminal helix from one dimer interacts with the beta4 region of an adjacent dimer, similar to a domain swap seen in CesT [ 13].	"CesT	154	158	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CesT"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This surface contains several conserved hydrophobic residues including L16, D24, N26, and I32 ( Fig. 2A), which is consistent with SrcA using a similar mechanism for interaction with effectors.

Since srcA expression was co - regulated with genes in SPI - 2, we hypothesized that it had a functional role in this system.	"srcA	6	10	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""srcA"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Since SsaN had not been characterized biochemically we first verified that our purified protein had ATPase activity ( Fig. S1).	"SsaN	6	10	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsaN"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
By itself, SrcA existed as a dimer in solution ( Fig. 4A) with no higher oligomers present, substantiating the stoichiometry obtained from our crystal data.	"SrcA	11	15	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SrcA"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

SrcA binds effector cargo destined for the SPI - 2 T3SS	"SrcA	0	4	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SrcA"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
First, we used stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture ( SILAC) [ 28] in conjunction with quantitative mass spectrometry - based proteomics to identify cargo immunoprecipitated with SrcA from Salmonella.	"SrcA	197	201	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SrcA"", ""start_span"": 197, ""end_span"": 201, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Lysates prepared from wild type cells grown in 2H4 - Lys and 13C6 - Arg containing SILAC medium ( heavy) and srcA mutant cells grown in medium containing natural amino acids of Lys and Arg ( light) were mixed and subjected to an immunoprecipitation procedure with an anti - FLAG antibody followed by quantitative mass spectrometry.	"srcA	109	113	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""srcA"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Peptides originating from wild type cells contained heavy atom - substituted lysine and arginine such that putative SrcA cargo proteins would generate low heavy: light SILAC peptide ratios from the complex mixtures ( Fig. 5A).	"SrcA	116	120	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SrcA"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Secondly, to verify the mass spectrometry data and to identify other possible effector cargo, we examined the secretion profiles of wild type cells and an srcA mutant that each expressed HA - tagged effector genes, the products of which are secreted by the SPI - 2 - encoded T3SS.	"srcA	155	159	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""srcA"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 159, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Structural features of SrcA We used a reverse genetics approach to define a new secretion chaperone in S.	"SrcA	23	27	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SrcA"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Consistent with other class I secretion chaperones, SrcA has extensive electronegative charge distributed over the surface of the molecule.	"SrcA	52	56	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SrcA"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
For instance, electronegative surface residues on the SigE chaperone in the SPI - 1 - encoded T3SS negatively affect cargo secretion, but not cargo stability [ 30].	"SigE	54	58	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SigE"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In contrast, the subunits of Spa15 undergo a significant relative rotation ( 80degrees) about the alpha2 - axis resulting in a different interface.	"Spa15	29	34	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Spa15"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

We recently described this type of regulatory evolution for pathogenic adaptation of Salmonella to its host [ 21] and srcA is consistent with regulatory evolution of chaperone - effector gene pairs that are not co - transcribed in operons.

SrcA is unique among other multi - effector chaperones most closely related to it in that it is unlinked from the T3SS genomic island.	"SrcA	0	4	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SrcA"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Given its genetic neighborhood, srcA appears to be a genetic acquisition separate from SPI - 2 that functionally links some effectors to the T3SS apparatus via the ATPase.	"srcA	32	36	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""srcA"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The other two, ( hmsHFRS and gmhA), are responsible for an extracellular polysaccharide and a lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) core modification that are required for normal biofilm formation and blockage in the flea [ 3], [ 4].

In contrast to hexose uptake systems, Y. pestis genes that encode permeases for the pentoses ribose, xylose, and arabinose were induced in the flea gut.	"permeases	66	75	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""permeases"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Acquisition of pentoses from the environment may be important because Y. pestis does not possess glucose 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase activity, the first step of the pentose phosphate pathway [ 19].

Although genes in the polyamine transport gabTpotDBC locus are among the most highly induced genes in the flea ( Table S1) and polyamines are essential for Y. pestis biofilm formation [ 30], we have previously reported that a Y. pestis Deltapot mutant has no defect in flea infection or blockage [ 31].

In addition to the known temperature - induced virulence factors, iron acquisition systems, including the ybt and yfe operons that are required for virulence; and oxidative and nitrosative stress response genes, including the hmp virulence factor, are highly upregulated in the rat bubo, but not the flea.

The Y. pestis outer surface protein gene yadB, recently shown to be required for dissemination and bubonic plague pathogenesis from a subcutaneous inoculation site [ 34], was significantly upregulated in both the flea and the bubo compared to in vitro conditions ( Tables 1, S1).

yitR, a LysR - type regulator that activates the Tc - like yit genes [ 50], was upregulated > 10 - fold in the flea, but its expression was not detected in the rat bubo ( Table 1).	"yitR	0	4	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""yitR"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The specific induction in the flea of yitR and genes in the adjacent Tc - like yit and yip loci suggests that they are involved in adaptation to and colonization of the flea.	"yitR	38	42	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""yitR"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Although this general expression changes could explain the complete loss of virulence of these mutants, it was remarkable the presence among them of ten genes, in addition to bvrS, whose products are already known to be associated with Brucella virulence [ 10], [ 11], [ 33], [ 34].

SeMac does not inhibit opsonophagocytosis of S. equi by horse PMNs but opsonophagocytosis of GAS by human PMNs.	"SeMac	0	5	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SeMac"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
For examples, both S. equi and group A Streptococcus ( GAS) produce the hyaluronic acid capsule and surface protein M protein to contribute to resistance to phagocytosis by PMNs.	"M protein	116	125	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""M protein"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In this study, SeMac was prepared and characterized.	"SeMac	15	20	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SeMac"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
All the strains tested had the mac gene ( Fig. 2).	"mac	31	34	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""mac"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
DNA sequencing found that the mac gene is 100% conserved in DNA sequence in these strains.	"mac	30	33	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""mac"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To assess the in vitro production of SeMac, culture supernatant of the 10 S. equi strains was prepared by the method of Lei et al.	"SeMac	37	42	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SeMac"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
[ 16], resolved by SDS - PAGE, and probed by Western immunoblot with anti - SeMac mouse antisera.	"SeMac	76	81	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SeMac"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
A catalytic triad of Cys94, His262, and Asp284 residues is critical for the enzymatic activity of GAS Mac [ 7, 8].	"Mac	102	105	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mac"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
SeMac possesses putative catalytic residues of Cys102, His272, and Asp294 ( Fig. 1).	"SeMac	0	5	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SeMac"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
SeMac does not Inhibit Opsonophagocytosis of S. equi by Horse PMN	"SeMac	0	5	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SeMac"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
A whole blood based phagocytosis assay [ 13, 14] was used to test whether SeMac inhibits opsonophagocytosis of S. equi by horse PMNs.	"SeMac	74	79	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SeMac"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The bacteria were labeled with FITC, treated with S. equi - specific horse convalescent serum in the absence or presence of SeMac, and incubated with horse blood.	"SeMac	124	129	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SeMac"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
SeMac indeed inhibits the opsonophagocytosis of GAS by human PMNs ( Fig. 5B).	"SeMac	0	5	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SeMac"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The residues of Cys102 and His272 are essential and Asp294 important for the enzymatic activity of SeMac.	"SeMac	99	104	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SeMac"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The peptide fragment, PELLGG, in the lower hinge region is proposed to bind to the active site of Mac [ 9], and the cleavage occurs between the two Gly residues ( Table 1).	"Mac	98	101	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mac"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This lower hinge region is not well conserved in the seven subgroups of horse IgG [ 17] ( Table 1).	"IgG	78	81	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IgG"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
