We demonstrate that AprA, an abundant secreted metalloprotease produced by P. entomophila, is an important virulence factor.	"AprA	20	24	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Inactivation of aprA attenuated both the capacity to persist in the host and pathogenicity.	"aprA	16	20	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Interestingly, aprA mutants were able to survive to wild - type levels in immune - deficient Relish flies, indicating that the protease plays an important role in protection against the Drosophila immune response.	"aprA	15	19	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
More precisely, our data points to an important role for the antimicrobial peptide Diptericin against orally infectious Gram - negative bacteria, emphasizing the critical role of local antimicrobial peptide expression against food - borne pathogens.	"Diptericin	83	93	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Diptericin"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In addition, the Imd pathway plays a predominant role in the regulation of AMPs in the alimentary tract and tracheal epithelia [ 7].	"Imd	17	20	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We present in vivo evidence for a direct role in pathogenesis of the secreted P. entomophila zinc metalloprotease, AprA, which counteracts AMPs synthesized by the host.	"AprA	115	119	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We subsequently purified this protease, termed AprA, to homogeneity from the P. entomophila supernatant by anion exchange chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography ( Figure 1D).	"AprA	47	51	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Injection of pure AprA into the hemocoel rapidly killed adult flies, identifying this protein as a bacterial toxin ( Figure 1E).	"AprA	18	22	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Feeding of larvae with high concentrations ( 1. 5 mg / ml) of AprA led to modest lethality ( unpublished data), recapitulating the properties of the P. entomophila supernatant.	"AprA	62	66	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The P. entomophila aprA Mutant Displays Attenuated Pathogenicity	"aprA	19	23	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The experiments described above suggested that AprA plays an important in vivo role in P. entomophila virulence.	"AprA	47	51	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To further test this hypothesis, we used a genetic approach by inactivating the aprA gene.	"aprA	80	84	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Sequence analysis of the locus corresponding to aprA revealed a genetic organization characteristic of this class of Type I - secreted proteases [ 14].	"aprA	48	52	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We inactivated the aprA gene by inserting a tetracycline resistance cassette by a double homologous recombination event.	"aprA	19	23	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
SDS - PAGE protein profiles of culture supernatants clearly demonstrated the absence of the 51 - kDa band, and in vitro protease activity of the aprA mutant confirmed the concomitant absence of secreted protease activity ( Figure 1C, lane 6, and 1F).	"aprA	145	149	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To analyze the in vivo contribution of AprA to P. entomophila virulence, we performed a survival analysis of Drosophila larvae and adults after oral infection with various P. entomophila derivatives.	"AprA	39	43	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Similarly, the aprA mutant showed reduced pathogenicity after oral infection of adult flies ( Figure S1).	"aprA	15	19	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We next compared persistence of wild - type P. entomophila and the aprA mutant by quantifying the number of bacteria in larvae and adults at different time points after infection.	"aprA	67	71	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Whereas the wild - type P. entomophila titer remained high, aprA bacterial levels decreased significantly with time ( Figure 3A, not shown for larvae).	"aprA	60	64	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Complementation of the aprA mutant with the wild - type apr operon restored protease secretion and activity ( Figure 1C, lane 7, and 1F) and resulted in a complete regain of function with respect to all virulence phenotypes ( Figures 2B and S1).	"aprA	23	27	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In contrast, no rescue was observed with a plasmid containing the full apr operon but carrying a non - polar mutation in aprA ( Figures 2B and S1).	"aprA	121	125	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These data confirmed that the protease AprA itself contributes to P. entomophila virulence.	"AprA	39	43	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The aprA Mutant Retains the Capacity to Trigger an Immune Response and to Induce Food - Uptake Cessation	"aprA	4	8	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The kinetics of the expression of the AMP, Diptericin, in larvae and adults after natural infection by P. entomophila and its derivative mutants, was analyzed by real time quantitative PCR ( RT - qPCR).	"Diptericin	43	53	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Diptericin"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To investigate the connection between activation of the Imd pathway and the outcome of P. entomophila infection in more detail, we focused our analysis on the adult stage when it is easier to monitor survival.	"Imd	56	59	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
P. entomophila infection triggers Imd pathway activation within hours.	"Imd	34	37	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This experiment indicates that P. entomophila can be eliminated when the Imd pathway is activated at a high level prior to infection.	"Imd	73	76	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Since P. entomophila is pathogenic under normal wild - type conditions, it may overcome the immune response by establishing a niche in the gut before the Imd pathway is activated.	"Imd	154	157	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We used the evf - deficient derivative because this bacterium triggers a local immune response without persisting in the gut.	"evf	12	15	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""evf"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This demonstrates that the protection was indeed due to Imd pathway activation in the gut.	"Imd	56	59	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Over - expression of Imd in the gut protected against P. entomophila, whereas its activation in the fat body did not ( Figure S2).	"Imd	21	24	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, the previous results did not address whether the Imd pathway induced during the course of a natural P. entomophila infection contributes to fly resistance to P. entomophila.	"Imd	58	61	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In these flies, the Imd pathway was not constitutively active in the gut but could be induced upon oral bacterial infection similarly to the wild - type situation ( Figure S3A).	"Imd	20	23	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It has also been suggested that proteases homologous to AprA in other bacterial species degrade AMPs in vitro, thereby enabling pathogens to withstand the attack of the host immune system [ 20, 21].	"AprA	56	60	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This experiment demonstrates that these AMPs can confer protection against P. entomophila and is in good agreement with a previous study showing that Attacin is the most potent AMP against Gram - negative bacteria [ 22].	"Attacin	150	157	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Attacin"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Importantly, it also reveals for the first time a major contribution of Diptericin to host defense, which was not previously detected using systemic injection of microbes [ 22].	"Diptericin	72	82	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Diptericin"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
No effect could be detected when Attacin A was over - expressed in agreement with the bacteriostatic mode of action of this AMP ( unpublished data).	"Attacin A	33	42	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Attacin A"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Altogether, our results provide an in vivo demonstration that AprA functions in the protection of P. entomophila against Drosophila AMPs.	"AprA	62	66	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Local Expression of AMP Genes Plays a Major Role against Food - Borne Infections The use of GFP reporter transgenes in Drosophila has revealed that, in addition to the fat body, AMP genes can be expressed in several barrier epithelia that are in direct contact with microorganisms from the environment [ 7, 23].	"GFP	92	95	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GFP"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The present study demonstrates a key role for the local Imd immune response in the gut against oral infection by bacterial pathogens.	"Imd	56	59	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To explore the potential implication of AMPs in the Imd immune defense against oral infection by P. entomophila, we compared survival of flies expressing only a single AMP.	"Imd	52	55	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Previous studies revealed only a modest contribution of Diptericin to resistance against Gram - negative bacteria during systemic infection [ 22].	"Diptericin	56	66	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Diptericin"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In contrast, our data reveal that Diptericin plays an essential role in the defense against Gram - negative bacteria when they are ingested.	"Diptericin	34	44	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Diptericin"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The antibacterial activity of Diptericin may be enhanced in the gut by pH and other factors such as lysozymes [ 24].	"Diptericin	30	40	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Diptericin"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It is also possible that Diptericin could reach high concentration levels in restricted areas of the Drosophila gut such as the proventriculus and thus be more effective against pathogens than in other body compartments.	"Diptericin	25	35	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Diptericin"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Our study suggests that Diptericin expression in the anterior gut provides an efficient early barrier allowing Drosophila to rapidly eliminate most ingested bacteria.	"Diptericin	24	34	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Diptericin"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
AprA Protects P. entomophila from Antibacterial Peptides	"AprA	0	4	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, our approach focusing on both host and pathogen is the first to clearly demonstrate a key role of the AprA metalloprotease in the protection against AMPs in vivo.	"AprA	108	112	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Altogether, our study reveals that local AMP expression plays an important role in defense against oral pathogens and that entomopathogens such as P. entomophila can counteract this effect by expressing aprA.	"aprA	203	207	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 203, ""end_span"": 207, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We cannot exclude that AprA degrades other immune effectors or participates directly as a toxic factor by degrading the gut epithelium or the peritrophic matrix.	"AprA	23	27	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The observation that injection of AprA into the hemocoel is lethal to adult flies supports the hypothesis of additional roles for the protease in bacterial pathogenesis.	"AprA	34	38	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Many pseudomonads and other bacteria express proteases similar to AprA but are not able to infect Drosophila by oral ingestion.	"AprA	66	70	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This indicates that AprA is not the sole virulence factor required for persistence in the Drosophila gastrointestinal tract.	"AprA	20	24	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Since gacA mutants did not persist in imd - deficient mutant hosts, we speculate that this persistence - promoting factor provides general protection against gut intestinal conditions rather than a specific protection against the fly immune response.	"gacA	6	10	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The signaling circuit that mediates this behavior terminates at the flagellar machinery, which is synthesized through a sequential hierarchy of gene activation events [ 10] initiated by the expression of the master transcriptional regulator FlhDC.	"FlhDC	241	246	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FlhDC"", ""start_span"": 241, ""end_span"": 246, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We have used a hyperactive Tn5 transposition system with reduced target specificity [ 16] to create a library of approximately 5 x 105 independent transposon insertional mutants in E. coli MG1655.	"Tn5	27	30	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Tn5"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The protein encoded by aer mediates oxygen and redox sensing, and as such shares overlapping function with the Tsr receptor [ 22].	"Tsr	111	114	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Tsr"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Finally, the product of trg is a transmembrane methyl - accepting chemotaxis protein that senses ribose and galactose [ 23].	"trg	24	27	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""trg"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Although these sugars are absent from tryptone plates, deletion of trg did result in a measurable motility defect ( unpublished data).	"trg	67	70	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""trg"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, of the more than 50 known genes involved, trg is the only false negative under the motility conditions we used.	"trg	53	56	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""trg"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The only exception among the che genes is cheZ, whose z - score of + 8. 7 indicates a CW flagellar rotation bias and reduced susceptibility to chi - phage infection.	"cheZ	42	46	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cheZ"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Of these, only the genes encoding RcsD and glucan synthesis proteins had been previously implicated in swimming motility [ 32, 33].	"RcsD	34	38	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RcsD"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The wide functional repertoire of gene products found to affect motility prompted us to examine whether genetic perturbations in these loci affect motility by signaling upstream of the regulatory circuit that controls flagellar biogenesis, resulting in repression of the flhDC flagellar master operon.	"flhDC	271	276	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""flhDC"", ""start_span"": 271, ""end_span"": 276, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In addition, we noticed that LPS mutants varied widely in flhDC expression and that the repression of this operon, and the corresponding motility defect, were related to the degree of LPS truncation ( Figure 4).	"flhDC	58	63	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""flhDC"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Previous evidence links LPS and OPG mutations to the activation of the Rcs phosphorelay system [ 34, 35], and the Rcs system is known to negatively regulate the flhDC operon [ 36].	"flhDC	161	166	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""flhDC"", ""start_span"": 161, ""end_span"": 166, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The pathway also includes a recently identified outer membrane lipoprotein ( RcsF) that is known to activate the Rcs system [ 37].	"RcsF	77	81	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RcsF"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Deletion of rcsC rescued motility to a lesser extent.	"rcsC	12	16	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""rcsC"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
An flhD mutant was used as a chi - phage - resistant control and, as expected, showed no sensitivity, whereas chi - phage multiplied rapidly in the presence of the wild - type strain ( Figure 5A).	"flhD	3	7	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""flhD"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Both OPG and LPS mutants showed decreased sensitivity to chi - phage, and the decrease in sensitivity was eliminated by introducing DeltarcsF deletions, indicating that OPG and LPS are not directly required for chi - phage infection ( Figures 5B - D).	"DeltarcsF	132	141	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltarcsF"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We found that mutants with OPG defects and severe LPS truncations were incapable of swarming and that introducing DeltarcsF deletions into these mutants was sufficient to rescue the phenotype ( Figures 3F and S6).	"DeltarcsF	114	123	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltarcsF"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These data indicate that LPS and OPG are not directly necessary for swarming, and that the behavior exhibited by such mutants results from Rcs - mediated repression of the flhDC operon.	"flhDC	172	177	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""flhDC"", ""start_span"": 172, ""end_span"": 177, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
yhjH Affects Flagellar Motor Bias	"yhjH	0	4	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""yhjH"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Mutations in yhjH were recently found to impair swimming motility [ 42].	"yhjH	13	17	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""yhjH"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Consistent with this, we found that insertions in yhjH exhibit a high average z - score of + 277 in our enrichment for nonmotile mutants.	"yhjH	50	54	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""yhjH"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To further characterize the effect of this mutation on motility, an in - frame deletion of yhjH was constructed.	"yhjH	91	95	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""yhjH"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Electron microscopy of DeltayhjH mutants showed the appearance of flagella, and light microscopy showed vigorous cellular movement ( unpublished data), indicating that the flagella are capable of rotating; still, this mutant exhibited severe impairment in swimming ( Figure 1C).	"DeltayhjH	23	32	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltayhjH"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To determine whether the absence of yhjH alters the direction of flagellar rotation, several functional studies were performed.	"yhjH	36	40	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""yhjH"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Second, while DeltayhjH mutants are impaired in swimming motility, they did not show a measurable defect in swarming ( Figure 6A), which is in agreement with our finding that flagellar motor switching is not critical for swarming.	"DeltayhjH	14	23	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltayhjH"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Together, these results indicate that the yhjH gene product is involved with the frequency of flagellar motor switching, a process that is among the remaining puzzles in bacterial chemotaxis [ 45].	"yhjH	42	46	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""yhjH"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
P1 transduction of this insertion to the DeltayhjH isogenic background confirmed the ability of the insertion to suppress the motility defect ( unpublished data).	"DeltayhjH	41	50	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltayhjH"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We hypothesize that mutations partially suppressing the chemotaxis defect of DeltayhjH mutants do so by correcting the severe CCW flagellar rotation bias.	"DeltayhjH	77	86	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltayhjH"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Further studies are underway to explore the functional relationship between yhjH and these suppressor mutations.	"yhjH	76	80	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""yhjH"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Suppressor mutations identified in the Deltahns background are shown and discussed in Figure S8, and the microarray results can be found in Dataset S12.	"Deltahns	39	47	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Deltahns"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
E. coli has 19 genes encoding proteins with GGDEF domains [ 55].	"GGDEF	44	49	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GGDEF"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, the results of the genome - wide screen for suppressors of the DeltayhjH motility defect reveals that this is not the case ( Table S2).	"DeltayhjH	72	81	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltayhjH"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These observations suggest that the expression and / or enzymatic activities of these GGDEF - containing proteins may be under precise context - dependent control.	"GGDEF	86	91	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GGDEF"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As stated previously, mutations in yfiR strongly abolish swarming motility.	"yfiR	35	39	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""yfiR"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These genes encode site - specific recombinases that catalyze the inversion of a DNA element known as the fim switch or fimS, whose orientation controls the expression of fimbrial structural genes [ 60].	"fimS	120	124	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""fimS"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Inversion of fimS by site - specific recombinases alternately connects and disconnects the fimbrial structural genes from their promoter, resulting in a process of phase variation that gives rise to bacteria in either the fimbriate ( phase ON) or afimbriate ( phase OFF) state [ 61].	"fimS	13	17	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""fimS"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
By randomly sampling mutants impaired for motility and sequencing the region of DNA adjacent to the transposon, we identified a mutant with a reduced ability to swim with an insertion within fimS.	"fimS	191	195	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""fimS"", ""start_span"": 191, ""end_span"": 195, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To determine the nature of the motility defect, we analyzed the fimS mutant by transmission electron microscopy.	"fimS	64	68	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""fimS"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We found that swarming was not impaired in either the fimS mutant or the mutants with fimbria locked in phase ON, indicating that fimbria expression does not interfere with swarming motility ( Figure S11C).	"fimS	54	58	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""fimS"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Consistent with this picture, the promoter of the flhDC operon, the master regulator of flagellar gene expression, is one of the most highly regulated loci in the genome and contains many transcription - factor binding sites [ 65].	"flhDC	50	55	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""flhDC"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We focused on inhibition of motility by high osmolarity ( 0. 5 M NaCl), since previous evidence suggested that this environmental condition signals to the flhDC regulatory region [ 66].

Recently, it was shown that the WxL domain attaches to the peptidoglycan on the cell surface [ 34] and one member of this WxL domain family, the homologue of EF2686 in OG1RF ( a probable internalin protein), was shown to be important for virulence in a mouse peritonitis model and is required for dissemination to the spleen and liver [ 35].

One of these is an approximately 49 kb fragment with a G + C content of 32. 1% located between an rRNA operon and the homologue in OG1RF of EF1053, replacing 10 tRNA genes present in V583 ( Figure 1).

For example, separate studies have shown ropB mutation to have either no effect on hemolysis and DNase activity or, alternatively, to increase expression of hemolysin and DNase - encoding genes and the associated phenotypic activities [ 23], [ 26].

Towards the global identification of Hfq targets, previous efforts have employed a combination of co - immunoprecipiatation ( co - IP) and or microarray analysis.	"Hfq	37	40	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Hfq"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
[ 10] used high - throughput pyrosequencing ( HTPS) to detect potential targets of an epitope tagged - Hfq protein co - immunoprecipitated with commercially available antibodies, overcoming the limitations of the previous strategy; the need for custom microarrays and specialized antibodies.

However this most likely is an underestimate of the true number of proteins that are regulated by Hfq, if accurate protein identifications could be made for the remaining 2829 orfs of the entire Salmonella proteome ( 4450 orfs) that are either expressed at levels too low to be detected or not expressed under the four growth conditions employed in this study.

Similarly 189 proteins represents approximately4% when compared to all annotated orfs but again this is likely an underestimate of proteins regulated by SmpB if accurate protein identifications could be made for the remaining 2829 orfs that are either expressed at levels too low to be detected or not expressed under the four growth conditions employed in this study.

Hfq also appears to play a role in the regulation of the translational machinery itself presumably as a feedback mechanism to maintain tight control over the amount of ribosomal synthesis.	"Hfq	0	3	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Hfq"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This suggests that Hfq normally represses translation of these genes under conditions that mimics the intracellular environment ( AMM).	"Hfq	19	22	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Hfq"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Collectively, these results point to a central role for Hfq in regulating stress response in Salmonella Typhimurium.	"Hfq	56	59	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Hfq"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
For example rpoE has been shown to be required for the virulence of Salmonella Typhimurium [ 35].	"rpoE	12	16	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""rpoE"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Hfq differentially regulated the expression of several proteins involved in lipopolysaccharides ( LPS) biosynthesis in acidic minimal media.	"Hfq	0	3	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Hfq"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
A recent study showed that an Deltahfq mutant that was non - motile exhibited an invasion defect [ 20].	"Deltahfq	30	38	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Deltahfq"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Consistent with this previous study, we observed reduced expression of SPI - 1 invasion proteins and numerous motility proteins in the Deltahfq mutant strain primarily in the log phase growth condition compared to the wildtype strain.	"Deltahfq	135	143	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Deltahfq"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This reduction in mRNA expression suggests that Hfq regulates motility and invasion at the transcription level, presumably by modulating one of the upstream regulators.	"Hfq	48	51	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Hfq"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Results from our proteomics analysis revealed that Hfq regulates the cob - pdu operon in AMM - 2 ( Figure 4A) and stationary phase ( Figure 4D) growth conditions, with several products of the cob - pdu operon exhibiting increased expression compared to wild type.	"Hfq	51	54	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Hfq"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This was not apparent in the DeltasmpB mutant strain in which cob - pdu protein levels are the same as the parent ( Figure 4A and 4D).	"DeltasmpB	29	38	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltasmpB"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The strong regulation of Pdu protein expression by Hfq suggests the pdu operon to be a potential target of sRNA regulation and that correct coordinate expression may be essential for activity.	"Hfq	51	54	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Hfq"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The data presented here suggests Hfq likely plays a substantial role in the regulation of the protein expression of the cob - pdu operon, required for intra - macrophage replication [ 47], via post - transcriptional regulatory mechanisms.

The normal function of SmpB is in quality control to free ribosomes stalled on defective mRNAs [ 11], [ 16].	"SmpB	23	27	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SmpB"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, results from our global proteomics analysis indicate that SmpB directly or indirectly modulates the expression of at least 4% of the entire Salmonella Typhimurium proteome determined from ANOVA analysis ( p < 0. 05) ( Table S1).	"SmpB	67	71	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SmpB"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The majority of genes encoding these proteins showed no changes in mRNA level thus it is interesting to speculate an additional role for SmpB as a general post - transcriptional / translational regulator in Salmonella Typhimurium.	"SmpB	137	141	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SmpB"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Few of the genes identified are regulated by RpoS again suggesting that this is a direct translational effect and not indirect transcriptional.	"RpoS	45	49	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RpoS"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This suggests that a more thorough examination of the role of SmpB in the regulation of cell motility and histidine biosynthesis is warranted.	"SmpB	62	66	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SmpB"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Previous attempts to identify processes / targets regulated by Hfq, and thus targets of sRNA regulation, have relied on transcript - centric approaches.	"Hfq	63	66	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Hfq"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In one study microarray analysis was used to identify changes in gene expression resulting from lack of Hfq, thus providing potential new target genes for sRNA regulation [ 27].	"Hfq	104	107	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Hfq"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Most recently high - throughput pyrosequencing ( HTPS) was used to detect message and sRNA bound to Hfq following immunoprecipitation [ 10].	"Hfq	100	103	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Hfq"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The result of this work was very surprising namely that Hfq bound to 20% of all Salmonella mRNA transcripts and at least 64 small RNA molecules.	"Hfq	56	59	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Hfq"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Taking into account all growth conditions about approximately50% of all observed proteins are regulated by Hfq an astonishingly high number.	"Hfq	107	110	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Hfq"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These results may explain the very high LD50 of the hfq mutant strain ( > 109 i. p.) and its growth defect even in rich media.	"hfq	52	55	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""hfq"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It has recently been shown that half of all the known sRNAs in Salmonella associate with Hfq [ 10].	"Hfq	89	92	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Hfq"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It is interesting to note that in adaptive evolution experiments using a chemostat to continuously alter grow conditions often results in changes in Hfq ( Bernard Palsson, UCSD, personal communication).

P. luminescens produces a signaling molecule AI - 2 to resist reactive oxygen species [ 8] and phenylpropanoid chemical ST to inhibit the activity of antimicrobial enzyme PO and formation of melanotic nodules [ 9], but the strategy used by X. nematophila appears to be that of suppression of transcripts involved in the insect immune response [ 10 - 12].	"AI - 2	45	51	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AI - 2"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In addition, P. luminescens encodes a type III secretion system and one of the effectors, LopT, suppresses phagocytosis and reduces nodulation by haemocytes [ 13, 14].	"LopT	90	94	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LopT"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, the genomes of Xenorhabdus bovienii and X. nematophila do not show homologues of LopT or a dedicated type III secretion system [ 3], and Xenorhabdus likely uses flagellar regulatory cascade to control cellular immunity [ 15].

Also gyrase A gene, a prokaryotic housekeeping gene, was not detected from the enriched in vivo cDNAs, but was detected in all other cDNA populations including in vitro and in vivo cDNAs before and after normalization, indicating that only differentially expressed genes were captured after enrichment.

As a whole, the protein networks of the identified genes were different for the two bacteria except that NAD synthetase gene nadE was found to be common to both bacteria.	"nadE	125	129	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""nadE"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Gene dacC encoding a peptidoglycan synthesis enzyme D - alanyl - D - alanine carboxypeptidase was induced in X. koppenhoeferi but not in P. temperata, implying that peptidoglycan undergoes structural alterations in X. koppenhoeferi that probably add to its fitness when residing in the host.

As a well - defined virulence factor playing a major role in the development of septicemia [ 22], lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis gene lpsE was induced in X. koppenhoeferi, but not in P. temperata, which may explain in part why relatively slower growing X. koppenhoeferi did not differ from P. temperata in virulence to R. majalis in our previous studies [ 17].

phoP has been previously identified to be involved in virulence as mutational inactivation of this gene rendered P. luminescens avirulent to Spodoptera littoralis larvae [ 6].	"phoP	0	4	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Similarly, the regulatory protein CpxR can be activated in response to signals associated with growth and metabolic pathways [ 28].	"CpxR	34	38	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CpxR"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
By sensing cell envelope stress CpxR appears to control expression of other genes involved in envelope stress response, secretion, motility and multidrug resistance [ 29].	"CpxR	32	36	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CpxR"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Besides transcriptional regulatory genes, gene tilS, encoding a putative cell cycle protein [ 4], was induced in X. koppenhoeferi.	"tilS	47	51	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""tilS"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Among the virulence genes identified in this study, tcaC was identified to be induced in both P. temperata and X. koppenhoeferi during infection of R. majalis.	"tcaC	52	56	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""tcaC"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This leads us to speculate that TcaC serves as either an activator or a chaperone in secretion of toxin complex from the cell as proposed by ffrench - Constant et al.	"TcaC	32	36	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TcaC"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Upregulation of gene sctL, encoding components of type III secretion machinery, possibly coordinates protein secretion system in P. temperata for translocating effector molecules across the bacterial cell envelope into host cells [ 38 - 40].

Similarly, induction of a chaperone protein encoding gene dnaK in both bacteria may picture common stress responses between P. temperata and X. koppenhoeferi in a number of cellular processes including rescue of misfolded proteins and control of the activity of folded regulatory proteins [ 46].

The glutathione synthetase gene gshB which mediates condensation of gamma - glutamylcysteine and glycine to form glutathione [ 47, 48] was induced in P. temperata, but glutathione reductase gene gor which reduces glutathione disulfide to the sulfhydryl form of glutathione [ 47, 48] was induced in X. koppenhoeferi.

Apart from the common mechanisms handling stresses, gene msrA encoding a peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase was unique to X. koppenhoeferi.	"msrA	57	61	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""msrA"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Products of msrA are found to interact with several other gene products ( see Additional file 2), also suggesting its importance during insect infection.	"msrA	12	16	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""msrA"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, upregulation of bioB encoding a biontin synthetase protein further suggests that TCA cycle is involved in P. temperata.	"bioB	27	31	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bioB"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Indeed, the pathway analysis reveals that def gene product interacts with CysS, a cysteinyl - tRNA synthetase ( see Additional file 1), also suggesting the requirement for cysteine in P. temperata during infection.

A protease gene, clpP, involved in protein degradation, was induced in X. koppenhoeferi upon infection.	"clpP	17	21	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""clpP"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The signal peptidase II encoded by lspA gene induced in P. temperata belongs to a class of aspartyl proteases.	"lspA	35	39	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""lspA"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Also supported by the pathway analysis, product of glnD identified from P. temperata likely controls the production of siderophore ( see Additional file 1).	"glnD	51	55	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""glnD"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In addition to ion scavenging systems, artM, encoding a putative ABC amino acid transport system [ 63] was identified in P. temperata, but not in X. koppenhoeferi.	"artM	39	43	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""artM"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Besides transporting L - arginine across the inner membrane [ 63], the pathway network reveals that the product of artM participates in cystine transport ( see Additional file 1), suggesting that this gene may also mediate cystine amino acid acquisition.	"artM	115	119	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""artM"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Upregulation of artM in P. temperata also suggests that amino acids may be available for uptake in the insect.	"artM	16	20	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""artM"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As cysteine synthesis gene cysK was also identified from P. temperata as discussed above, it may indicate that the level of cysteine either synthesized by P. temperata or acquired from the insect host is not sufficient during infection.

Despite unknown mechanistic details of Tol system, upregulation of P. temperata tolB gene suggests that it may be involved in importing biomolecules by somehow supplying energy or transport as noted by Nikaido [ 66] in other bacteria.

While genes encoding TcaC toxin and hemolysin related proteins were identified to be induced in both P. temperata and X. koppenhoeferi, the two bacteria seem to use different regulatory genes, secretion systems and virulence factors to achieve infection of the same insect host R. majalis.

While many virulence factors have been identified, such as lipopolysaccharides, capsular polysaccharides, Apx toxins and iron acquisition systems [ 4], or suggested, like biofilm formation [ 8], autotransporter adhesin [ 9] and autotransporter protease synthesis [ 10], very little is known about the overall contribution of each component to the infection process.

In bacteria, Fur down - regulates the transcription of genes involved in iron - acquisition and iron homeostasis in bacterial cells, and its action is directly linked to the amount of available iron, as it requires Fe2 + as a cofactor [ 41].

In E. coli, Fur also regulates its own level of expression.	"Fur	12	15	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Fur"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Since these genes were not identified in a previous transcript profiling experiment under iron - restricted conditions [ 28], this might imply that they are not regulated by Fur.	"Fur	174	177	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Fur"", ""start_span"": 174, ""end_span"": 177, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The hfq gene, which codes for a protein involved in RNA molecule stability and RNA - RNA interactions [ 43] and that therefore has an important regulatory function, was also down - regulated.	"hfq	4	7	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""hfq"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Finally, the kpsF gene, coding for an arabinose - 5 - phosphate isomerase, should also be mentioned since it is involved in the pathway responsible for the synthesis of 2 - keto - 3deozyoctulosonic acid ( Kdo), which is present in the A. pleuropneumoniae LPS core oligosaccharide [ 52] and capsule of serotype 5 [ 53].

However, since this was deduced from sequence homologies, the real function of irp in A. pleuropneumoniae cannot be reliably inferred, but it is conserved in various bacterial pathogens.	"irp	79	82	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""irp"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

It is the most important adhesin in B. pertussis, and deletion of FHA in B. bronchiseptica, another important swine respiratory pathogen, caused lower colonization than the wild - type strain at all respiratory tract sites tested with was unable to cause disease [ 74].

In B. bronchiseptica, FhaB is believed to be important early in the infection process in order to allow colonization of the ciliated epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract.	"FhaB	22	26	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FhaB"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In Histophilus somni, the FhaB homolog is thought to also have an important role in biofilm formation in cases of myocarditis caused by this micro - organism [ 75].	"FhaB	26	30	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FhaB"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Up - regulation of the A. pleuropneumoniae fhaB homolog during the acute phase of the disease hints at a similar role for this adhesin in the establishment of pleuropneumonia.	"fhaB	43	47	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""fhaB"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

To better understand the phenomenon of regulatory evolution in S. enterica, we defined the SsrB regulon and asked how this transcription factor interacts with the cis - regulatory region of target genes.

Using ChIP - on - chip, cDNA hybridization, and comparative genomics analyses, we describe the SsrB - dependent regulon of ancestral and horizontally acquired genes.	"SsrB	95	99	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Further, we used a genetic screen and computational analyses integrating experimental data from S. enterica and sequence data from an orthologous regulatory system in the insect endosymbiont, Sodalis glossinidius, to identify the conserved yet flexible palindrome sequence that defines DNA recognition by SsrB.

Silencing of horizontally - acquired genes by DNA binding proteins like H - NS is one way some incoming genes are initially controlled [ 2], [ 3], which can then be subject to regulatory evolution by mutating cis - regulatory operator regions to select for optional gene expression.

It is generally accepted that SPI - 2 was acquired by Salmonella enterica after divergence from S. bongori, providing a useful pedigree to study regulatory evolution influenced by SsrB.	"SsrB	180	184	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 180, ""end_span"": 184, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Our focus was on SsrB because of its broad conservation among the pathogenic Salmonellae and its essentiality for animal infection, suggesting it coordinates fundamental aspects of Salmonella pathogenesis beyond the SPI - 2 genomic island.	"SsrB	17	21	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In this study we investigated how regulatory evolution assimilates horizontally acquired and ancestral genes into the SsrB regulon on a genome - wide scale using an integrated set of experimental methods.	"SsrB	118	122	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Combining our data with previous biochemical work, along with comparative genomic analyses with an orthologous T3SS - encoding genomic island in the tsetse fly endosymbiont, Sodalis glossinidius, we reveal the flexible DNA palindrome that distributes SsrB in the genome to influence transcriptional activation of the SPI - 2 T3SS and almost all of its accessory effector proteins.

Our data uncovers the principal SsrB circuitry that appears to have been conserved to support multiple bacterial lifestyles, including parasitic and mutualist symbioses.	"SsrB	32	36	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We identified 133 genes that were significantly down - regulated in the ssrB mutant [ z < - 1. 96] [ 21] ( Table 1).	"ssrB	72	76	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ssrB"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Orthologous genes ancestral to both species but regulated by SsrB in S. enterica provide evidence for network expansion and regulatory evolution that we previously showed can be mapped to a single cis - input location by using functional and comparative genomics [ 19].	"SsrB	61	65	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To expand on this, we used a reciprocal BLAST - based analysis and identified 47 orthologs in S. bongori among the 133 genes whose transcription was down - regulated in an ssrB mutant ( Table 1).	"ssrB	172	176	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ssrB"", ""start_span"": 172, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In DeltassrB cells, the mean fold - change of the orthologous genes ( - 6. 1 - fold) was subtler than for the S. enterica - specific gene set ( mean - 21. 2 - fold), which included the T3SS and associated effector genes ( Dataset S1).

Of the 133 down - regulated genes identified, 56 were present within genomic islands ( Table 1), with a mean change in gene expression of - 25. 3 - fold in DeltassrB cells.	"DeltassrB	156	165	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltassrB"", ""start_span"": 156, ""end_span"": 165, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Genome - wide SsrB interactions	"SsrB	14	18	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
With this method, we identified 256 significant interaction peaks distributed throughout the genome that were enriched under SsrB - activating conditions and with interaction scores three standard deviations greater than the mean probe score ( Figure 2A and Table 1).	"SsrB	125	129	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Given the strong influence of SsrB on horizontally acquired genes ( Table 1), we plotted the ChIP - on - chip data against all genomic islands in S.	"SsrB	30	34	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
From this analysis, 62 of 256 SsrB binding peaks ( 24. 3%) occurred within genomic islands ( Figure 2B).	"SsrB	30	34	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To generate a consensus set of SsrB regulated genes, we performed an analysis to identify operons in the S.	"SsrB	31	35	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
From this, the 133 down - regulated genes mapped to 86 operons, 49 of which had an SsrB interaction upstream or within the first gene of the operon ( Table 2).	"SsrB	83	87	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

We used the PhoP response regulator from E. coli as a control because a DNA recognition sequence for it was known [ 28].	"PhoP	12	16	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PhoP"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
From 189 unique sequences isolated for SsrBc, over 80% contained a degenerate consensus motif, mCCyTA ( Figure 4B).	"SsrBc	39	44	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrBc"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We identified variations of this motif within footprinted regions of SsrB - regulated promoters [ 25],, however sequence degeneracy made it difficult to precisely map the input functions.	"SsrB	69	73	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To solve this problem in the context of mapping the SsrB binding element, we used comparative genomics to search for conserved promoter architecture in another organism with a similar genomic island to Salmonella SPI - 2.	"SsrB	52	56	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Highly conserved sites within the promoters were restricted to regions previously footprinted by SsrB [ 25], [ 26], whereas adjacent sequence showed substantial drift ( Figure 4C).	"SsrB	97	101	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This palindrome was found in all SPI - 2 and SSR - 3 T3SS promoters with the exception of the sseA promoter that had only one reasonably well - conserved heptamer in the footprinted region ( Figure 4C and Figure S1).	"sseA	94	98	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""sseA"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Evaluation of the heptamer motif in the palindrome showed high similarity to the motifs identified by the bacterial one - hybrid screen and the ChIP - on - chip experiments ( Figure 4B and 4D), giving us confidence that we had identified the major recognition module for transcriptional input by SsrB.

In accord with a previous observation [ 26], there was not a strict requirement in the spacing between the SsrB binding site and the downstream transcriptional start site.	"SsrB	107	111	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
SsrB directs transcriptional input using a flexible palindrome architecture	"SsrB	0	4	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The presence of a conserved palindrome sequence in SPI - 2 promoters and in related sequences from the endosymbiont S. glossinidius suggested that regulatory input by SsrB was through a palindrome sequence architecture.	"SsrB	167	171	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 167, ""end_span"": 171, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We chose the ssaG promoter for these experiments because 16 of 18 bases were identical between SPI - 2 and SSR - 3 from S. glossinidius, differing only in the 4 - bp spacer between heptamers ( Figure 4C).	"ssaG	13	17	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ssaG"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We mutated the palindrome in a series of transcriptional reporters that were otherwise identical to the evolved ssaG promoter ( Figure 5A) and promoter activity was compared to that of a wild - type palindrome sequence.	"ssaG	112	116	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ssaG"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Precise deletion of the entire 18 - bp palindrome lead to approximately10% residual activity in wild - type cells, which was reduced to less than 1% in an ssrB mutant ( Figure 5C).	"ssrB	155	159	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ssrB"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 159, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To determine whether the remaining 10% transcriptional activity was a result of an SsrB - dependent feed - forward mechanism or transcriptional read - through of our chromosomally integrated reporter, we constructed an ectopic deletion reporter.	"SsrB	83	87	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The possibility existed that this modified heptamer, although now weaker in consensus, could still be sufficient for recruitment of a functional form of SsrB when paired with the other wild - type heptamer.

All of the critical residues in the dimerization helix and HTH motif required for specific transcriptional activity by SsrB [ 32] are conserved in the Sodalis ortholog ( Figure S3).	"SsrB	119	123	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

The transcriptional activity from a wild - type Sodalis palindrome sequence was high, but was completely abolished in an ssrB mutant and in experiments where only the palindrome sequence was precisely deleted ( Figure 5D).	"ssrB	121	125	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ssrB"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These experiments demonstrated a functional role for the conserved palindrome in Sodalis and the requirement for SsrB for transcriptional activation.	"SsrB	113	117	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The above results identified the conserved, yet flexible, palindrome sequence defining DNA recognition by SsrB.	"SsrB	106	110	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The palindrome in the ssrA promoter was not used to create the PWM due to its weaker consensus in the left heptamer, however, it was recovered in the computational analysis in a second group of lower - scoring motifs ( Figure 6A).	"ssrA	22	26	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ssrA"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We identified 24 palindromes co - occurring with ChIP - on - chip peaks upstream of 24 different SsrB - regulated genes or operons.	"SsrB	97	101	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
No palindrome was identified for the ssaJ interaction peak and so further characterization was not pursued.	"ssaJ	37	41	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ssaJ"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
For the IGR palindrome upstream of ssaR, we tested both a chromosome - integrated transcriptional fusion and an autonomous episomal reporter.	"ssaR	35	39	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ssaR"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Together, these data provide compelling evidence for the identity of the DNA recognition element that has been selected through evolution to co - regulate an SsrB - dependent gene program involved in adaptation to a host.	"SsrB	158	162	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 158, ""end_span"": 162, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Extensive work has been reported on the characterization of SsrB dependent genes, including functional evaluation of genes encoded within SPI - 2 in addition to genome - wide transcriptional studies [ 14], [ 15].	"SsrB	60	64	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In this study we identified genes co - expressed under SsrB - inducing conditions and found those with strong levels of expression localized predominantly to mobile genetic elements, recently acquired genomic islands or other annotated islands.	"SsrB	55	59	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Some of these genes may not be directly regulated by SsrB and will require further experimental investigation.	"SsrB	53	57	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This analysis identified many interactions which have not been previously described and interaction sites within coding regions of genes which may represent non - canonical functions for SsrB.	"SsrB	187	191	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 187, ""end_span"": 191, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Other groups have reported the existence of similar numbers of ChIP - on - chip interactions within intragenic regions for other transcription factors [ 35], [ 36] suggesting that this phenomenon is not restricted to SsrB.	"SsrB	217	221	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 217, ""end_span"": 221, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In light of the disparate number of microarray genes in comparison to ChIP - on - chip peaks we attempted to generate a more comprehensive picture of the SsrB regulon by combining these data sets at the operon level.	"SsrB	154	158	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In doing so we believe that the nineteen operons containing differentially expressed genes determined by microarray and containing a ChIP - on - chip peak three standard deviations above the mean captured by this analysis represent the genes directly activated by SsrB ( Table 2).	"SsrB	264	268	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 264, ""end_span"": 268, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Those operons having a ChIP - on - chip peak directly upstream in the IGR region encompass the majority of known SsrB regulated genes while those possessing a ChIP peak within the CDS of the first gene may represent non - functional interactions that deserve follow - up experimental investigation.	"SsrB	113	117	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
By using a genetic screening strategy together with functional and comparative genomics, we were able to define the essential SsrB regulatory element as being an 18 - bp palindrome with a conserved 7 - 4 - 7 internal organization.	"SsrB	126	130	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Evaluation of the 7 - 4 - 7 palindrome in the ssaG promoter revealed the minimal architecture and sequence orientation required for transcriptional input.	"ssaG	46	50	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ssaG"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Deletion of the entire palindrome resulted in less than 1% activity in wild - type cells, an equivalent level of activity to those lacking ssrB entirely.	"ssrB	139	143	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ssrB"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Although palindrome architecture was conserved upstream of SsrB - regulated genes, degenerate palindromes in which one half - site was more conserved were also functional.	"SsrB	59	63	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As a result of our mutational analyses we conclude that so long as the orientation of a single heptamer of the palindrome is conserved with respect to the downstream gene, SsrB is tolerant of degeneracy in the adjacent spacer and heptamer sequences.

A recent report by Carroll et al, postulated that SsrB first interacts with DNA as a monomer, followed by dimerization [ 32].	"SsrB	50	54	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The finding that a flexible palindromic sequence can be selective for SsrB input raises many interesting questions around the nature of regulatory evolution.	"SsrB	70	74	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We showed that the SsrB regulatory palindrome is also present in the orthologous SSR - 3 island of the endosymbiont Sodalis glossinidius and that the palindrome evolved in Sodalis can act as a cis regulatory input function in Salmonella.	"SsrB	19	23	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To the contrary, high local conservation in the promoters evolved in Salmonella and Sodalis was the crux in defining the functional SsrB input among stochastic noise.	"SsrB	132	136	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Among palindrome - containing promoters, the ssrA promoter is exceptional for two reasons: a lack of conservation between Salmonella and Sodalis, and the evolution of tandem palindromes in Salmonella.

The DNA module that choreographs SsrB - mediated pathogenic behaviour in Salmonella appears to have been conserved for mutualism as well, thereby shedding new light on the significance of cis - regulatory mutations for bacteria evolving in different ecological settings.

Having previously reported that M1T1 Streptococcus pyogenes become hypervirulent in mice due to selection of mutants in the covRS regulatory genes, we set out to dissect the impact of these mutations in vitro and in vivo from the impact of other adaptive events.

Using a murine subcutaneous chamber model to sample the bacteria prior to selection or expansion of mutants, we compared gene expression dynamics of wild type ( WT) and previously isolated animal - passaged ( AP) covS mutant bacteria both in vitro and in vivo, and we found extensive transcriptional alterations of pathoadaptive and metabolic gene sets associated with invasion, immune evasion, tissue - dissemination, and metabolic reprogramming.	"covS	213	217	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""covS"", ""start_span"": 213, ""end_span"": 217, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Our findings demonstrate the engagement of unique regulatory modules in niche adaptation, implicate a critical role for bacterial genetic heterogeneity that surpasses transcriptional in vivo adaptation, and portray the dynamics underlying the selection of hypervirulent covS mutants over their parental WT cells.	"covS	270	274	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""covS"", ""start_span"": 270, ""end_span"": 274, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Subsequent studies uncovered that this genetic switch is driven by host innate immune pressure that selects for bacteria with pathoadaptive mutations in the covRS genetic locus [ 13], [ 14].

In accordance with these biochemical findings, we and others have reported that some covS mutations generate hypervirulent isolates associated with invasive forms of streptococcal infection [ 13], [ 14], [ 26], [ 28].

One of the most striking outcomes of these mutations is the constitutive repression of a gene encoding the key GAS cysteine protease, SpeB, which remodels the host - pathogen interface [ 29] by differentially degrading bacterial surface and secreted proteins [ 12], [ 30], [ 31] as well as host proteins [ 32], [ 33], [ 34].

Consequently, absence of a proteolytically active SpeB preserves several virulence factors that it normally degrades [ 12], [ 35].	"SpeB	50	54	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SpeB"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Additionally, the effects of covS mutations on bacterial niche adaptability are still undetermined because the in vivo transcriptomes of the wild type ( WT) and animal - passaged ( AP) bacteria have not been compared under the same experimental conditions.	"covS	29	33	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""covS"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This difference in buoyancy can be attributed to differences in proteolytic activity ( WT > > AP) that may degrade many surface proteins, including pilin, or induce changes in the surface charge making bacterial aggregates more compact.	"pilin	148	153	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""pilin"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Overall, at the least conservative statistical threshold ( P < 0. 05), the transcription of 557 ( 23. 9%) out of 2, 329 genes probed in the microarrays was significantly perturbed ( up or down, at one or more conditions, Fig. S3) and the only set of contiguous genes that underwent transcriptional changes at all tested conditions is the SpeB operon gene set ( CC4 in Fig. 2).	"SpeB	338	342	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SpeB"", ""start_span"": 338, ""end_span"": 342, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, the fold - change in SpeB operon transcription level largely varied across the four experimental conditions, ranging from a 2. 2 - fold to a 30 - fold downregulation ( Table 3).	"SpeB	30	34	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SpeB"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
For example, in both the SLS operon and the Trx locus, we observed a striking difference between the effects of the covS mutation and the in vivo adaptation ( Fig. 4, CC6).	"covS	116	120	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""covS"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Data integration reveals genomic subsystems influenced by the covS mutation in vitro and in vivo	"covS	62	66	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""covS"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Of interest, among the genes of known function, 25% of those whose transcription was modulated as a consequence of the covS mutation are virulence - related and another 25% are related to carbohydrate metabolism pathways, which are connected to virulence in streptococci [ 44], [ 45], [ 46].	"covS	119	123	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""covS"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Another complex regulatory pattern is exhibited by the genes of the Trx locus, which include a two - component regulatory system, TrxRS.	"TrxRS	130	135	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TrxRS"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Most genes within the Trx locus are downregulated in AP GAS relative to WT, but upregulated in the WT bacteria in vivo ( Fig. 2, CC6 and Fig. 3) suggesting the possibility of CovS - dependent in vivo signaling.	"CovS	175	179	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CovS"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 179, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These in vivo - selected bacteria with the AP phenotype could be differentiated from the WT bacteria by mutations that are clustered in the sensor kinase - encoding covS gene in AP bacteria [ 14], [ 27].	"covS	165	169	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""covS"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 169, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Environmental adaptation vs. covS mutation	"covS	29	33	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""covS"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This finding is in agreement with studies showing that the CovRS system is mainly linked to the regulation of virulence factors and virulence - associated pathways [ 19], [ 20], [ 24], [ 26], [ 27], [ 28], [ 52], [ 53], [ 54], [ 55].	"CovRS	59	64	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CovRS"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Whereas SpeB expression may be important in the initial stages of skin infections [ 29], [ 35], its downregulation has been associated with an invasive and hypervirulent phenotype [ 13], [ 14], [ 59].	"SpeB	8	12	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SpeB"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Interestingly, what this study revealed is that some of the downstream regulatory effects of the covS mutation in AP bacteria are only manifested in vivo.	"covS	97	101	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""covS"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Both these expression patterns suggest CovS - dependent in vivo signaling via different downstream pathways.	"CovS	39	43	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CovS"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Taken together, these results demonstrate how the murine model has allowed us to finely dissect two classes of events affecting GAS sociomicrobiology: those related to reversible transcriptional adaptation and those irreversibly caused by the covS mutation in AP bacteria.	"covS	243	247	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""covS"", ""start_span"": 243, ""end_span"": 247, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This has been demonstrated by the larger number of genes affected during in vivo adaptation of both M1T1 variants compared to those affected by the covS mutation ( Table 2).	"covS	148	152	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""covS"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
( 2) The covS mutation in AP bacteria seems to be preferentially modulating virulence mechanisms, as about 25% of the known genes perturbed by the mutation belong to virulence subsystems ( Fig. 5) and many of the other perturbed genes are indirectly associated with virulence ( e. g., carbohydrate metabolism [ 66] and arginine utilization proteins [ 38]).	"covS	9	13	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""covS"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, a complete shutdown of proteolytically active SpeB is essential to preserve effective extracellular virulence factors [ 15].	"SpeB	52	56	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SpeB"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, the CovRS system is a major player, among these regulators, in driving the bacterial adaptation to the host ' s environment and regulating virulence directly or through other downstream regulators [ 20], [ 54].	"CovRS	13	18	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CovRS"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It is thus counterintuitive that bacteria lacking the important environmental sensor, CovS, would prevail in one of the most stressful environments.	"CovS	86	90	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CovS"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This flexible mechanism allows the bacteria to initially hide from the immune system through SpeB - driven camouflaging, i. e. degradation of most of their immunogenic virulence factors [ 2], [ 3].	"SpeB	93	97	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SpeB"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In conclusion, we have established a model that allowed us to resolve two sets of complex transcriptional events: ( i) those occurring in response to the host environment and ( ii) those caused by a mutation in covS sensor kinase.	"covS	211	215	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""covS"", ""start_span"": 211, ""end_span"": 215, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Inactivation of CovRS was also observed at phenotypic level: the mutant strains became less virulent compared to the parental wild - type strain [ 9].	"CovRS	16	21	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CovRS"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Transcriptome analysis revealed the CovRS core - regulon which consisted of 39 genes including genes of the stress response, the genes important for adhesion of S. agalactiae to the host cells and others [ 10].	"CovRS	36	41	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CovRS"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As result, 53 strains isolated from pregnant women and 5 strains isolated from the cow ' s milk were found to be bac gene positive.	"bac	113	116	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bac"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As result, most of human bac gene positive strains showed resistance or intermediate resistance to Em in the standard diffusion disk test, that is in agreement with previous observations demonstrating an increase in Em resistance in S. agalactiae population [ 30], [ 31].	"bac	25	28	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bac"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In this strain, the bac gene has unique allele with the closest similarity with 676a and 676b alleles according to classification of Kong et al.	"bac	20	23	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bac"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Subsequently, EcoRI fragments were cloned into suicide vector pVA891 - 2, and the recombinant plasmids named as pHK and pRR, respectively, were used to transform S. agalactiae strain 168 / 00 according to the protocol [ 33].

Effect of insertional inactivation on expression of beta - antigen	"beta - antigen	52	66	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""beta - antigen"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Effect of insertional inactivation on transcription of bac gene	"bac	55	58	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bac"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In order to analyze if changes in beta - antigen expression are regulated at transcriptional level, the quantitative RT - PCR was performed using RNA samples isolated during the middle - exponential phase corresponding to 2 hrs of growth.	"beta - antigen	34	48	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""beta - antigen"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, the regulatory mechanism of bac gene expression has not been studied.	"bac	37	40	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bac"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Importantly, 8 out of 9 amino acids, which composed HTH motif presumably involved in DNA - binding according to BLASTp analysis ( http: / / blast. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov / Blast. cgi), were lost in Sak189 protein due to insertional mutagenesis.	"Sak189	195	201	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sak189"", ""start_span"": 195, ""end_span"": 201, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Intraperitoneal infection of laboratory mice demonstrated that Sak189 DNA - binding response regulatory protein is important for virulent properties of S. agalactiae.	"Sak189	63	69	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sak189"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, we suggest that beta - antigen located on the bacterial surface can interfere with the disease process and play a role of anti - virulent factor ( at least, in mice) similarly to hyaluronate lyase of S. pyogenes [ 41].	"beta - antigen	22	36	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""beta - antigen"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It is also in agreement with results of Kong et al. who demonstrated that presence of shorter variants of beta - antigen is associated with increased virulence [ 32].	"beta - antigen	106	120	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""beta - antigen"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
