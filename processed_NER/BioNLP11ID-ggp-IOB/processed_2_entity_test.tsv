Several genetic studies have demonstrated the regulation of AMP synthesis by the Toll and immune - deficient ( Imd) pathways.

Among them we identified the GacS / GacA two - component regulatory system which, in Pseudomonas fluorescens, has been well characterized and demonstrated to be an essential regulator of virulence [ 11].	"GacS	29	33	Protein"	"GacA	36	40	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GacS"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GacA"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
No killing of either larvae or adults was observed with a culture filtrate derived from the avirulent P. entomophila strain carrying a Tn5 transposon in the gacA gene [ 9].	"Tn5	135	138	Protein"	"gacA	157	161	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Tn5"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These data suggested that P. entomophila secreted one or more factors with toxic activity under the control of the GacS / GacA two - component system.	"GacS	115	119	Protein"	"GacA	122	126	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GacS"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GacA"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
MALDI - TOF analysis of tryptic fragments of the 51 - kDa band identified this protein as a homolog of the previously characterized Apr proteases from Pseudomonas spp., Prt proteases from Erwinia spp. and Photorhabdus spp., and serralysins from Serratia spp.	"Prt	169	172	Protein"	"serralysins	228	239	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Prt"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 172, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""serralysins"", ""start_span"": 228, ""end_span"": 239, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Interestingly, in a gacA mutant the number of proteins in the supernatant was greatly reduced, including the complete absence of the 51 - kDa band corresponding to AprA ( Figure 1C, lane 3).	"gacA	20	24	Protein"	"AprA	164	168	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 168, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Two independent Tn5 insertions in the prtR gene affecting virulence have recently been identified in a random insertional mutagenesis screen of P. entomophila [ 10].	"Tn5	16	19	Protein"	"prtR	38	42	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Tn5"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""prtR"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Interestingly, both prtR mutants ( CL25 and CU1) displayed a secreted protein profile identical to the wild - type strain except for a marked decrease of AprA ( Figure 1C, lanes 4 and 5).	"prtR	20	24	Protein"	"AprA	154	158	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""prtR"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore, the prtR supernatant showed no toxicity toward flies after injection, suggesting a correlation between AprA levels and virulence ( unpublished data).	"prtR	17	21	Protein"	"AprA	116	120	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""prtR"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Altogether, this analysis indicates that P. entomophila gacA and prtR genes regulate the secretion of a protease with toxic activity when injected into flies or fed to larvae.	"gacA	56	60	Protein"	"prtR	65	69	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""prtR"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Only 40% of the aprA - infected larvae succumbed within 3 days, while 70% of the larvae died after infection with wild - type P. entomophila, demonstrating that the aprA mutant was attenuated for virulence ( Figure 2B).	"aprA	16	20	Protein"	"aprA	165	169	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 169, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, aprA gut persistence remained higher than that of gacA mutants.	"aprA	9	13	Protein"	"gacA	59	63	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The observation that both factors are under the control of the GacS / GacA, confirmed that this two - component system is the master regulator of P. entomophila virulence.	"GacS	63	67	Protein"	"GacA	70	74	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GacS"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GacA"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
AprA Confers Protection against the Imd - Dependent Immune Response	"AprA	0	4	Protein"	"Imd	36	39	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The observation that P. entomophila persistence in flies and larvae is lower in aprA mutants clearly indicates that the AprA protease promotes bacterial persistence in the Drosophila gut.	"aprA	80	84	Protein"	"AprA	120	124	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To determine at which time Imd was required to impede P. entomophila infection, we monitored survival to P. entomophila in flies in which the Imd pathway was artificially activated in a time - dependent manner.	"Imd	27	30	Protein"	"Imd	142	145	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Altogether, these data reveal that the Imd pathway is crucial for host survival after oral infection with P. entomophila and that AprA plays a key role in counteracting this effect.	"Imd	39	42	Protein"	"AprA	130	134	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
P. entomophila, but not the gacA derivative, rapidly activates both the local and systemic Imd - dependent immune responses in Drosophila adults, which can be demonstrated using RT - qPCR with fat body and gut extracts ( Figure 5A).	"gacA	28	32	Protein"	"Imd	91	94	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This experiment shows that wild - type, but not Rel flies previously infected with Ecc15 evf -, resisted a second challenge by P. entomophila ( Figure 5D).	"Rel	48	51	Protein"	"evf	89	92	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rel"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""evf"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The results described above were corroborated by the over - expression of Imd in the gut or in the fat body using specific Gal4 drivers.	"Imd	74	77	Protein"	"Gal4	123	127	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Gal4"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These flies lack a functional Imd pathway except in the gut where cad - Gal4 is expressed.

AprA Confers Protection against Diptericin	"AprA	0	4	Protein"	"Diptericin	32	42	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Diptericin"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We have shown that AprA protects P. entomophila against the Imd - regulated immune response.

Previous studies indicated that Attacin A and Diptericin are the AMP genes most strongly induced in the gut following ingestion of infectious bacteria [ 7].	"Attacin A	32	41	Protein"	"Diptericin	46	56	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Attacin A"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Diptericin"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We confirmed that P. entomophila AprA rapidly degrades Cecropin A in vitro ( unpublished data).	"AprA	33	37	Protein"	"Cecropin A	55	65	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Cecropin A"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In a first set of experiments, we compared the survival rate of wild - type, imd, and imd; da > Dpt or AttA flies to natural infection with P. entomophila.	"Dpt	96	99	Protein"	"AttA	103	107	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Dpt"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""AttA"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To investigate the in vivo relationship between AMP activity and microbial persistence we next compared the numbers of bacteria of wild - type P. entomophila and aprA mutants in imd fly lines over - expressing Diptericin.	"aprA	162	166	Protein"	"Diptericin	210	220	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 162, ""end_span"": 166, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Diptericin"", ""start_span"": 210, ""end_span"": 220, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Figure 6B shows that the aprA mutant persisted less well than wild - type bacteria in imd flies over - expressing Diptericin.

This result clearly indicates an in vivo action of AprA against Diptericin.

Our study reveals that over - expression of either Diptericin or Attacin confers protection against P. entomophila.

In B. thuringiensis, it has been proposed that the protease InhA2 participates in the degradation of the gut, thus facilitating the action of the Cry toxins [ 27, 28].

Alternatively, in Photorhabdus luminescens, an AprA homologue, PrtA, has been proposed not to be a virulence factor, but rather to be involved in degrading host tissues following host death in order to promote efficient nutrition and development of its symbiotic nematode host [ 14, 29].	"AprA	47	51	Protein"	"PrtA	63	67	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PrtA"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, oral ingestion of purified AprA induces only low levels of lethality, indicating that AprA alone is not sufficient to kill the host via this route of entry, and other factors participate in oral toxicity.

The GacS / GacA two - component regulatory system is conserved in numerous Gram - negative bacteria and has been shown to regulate a wide variety of cellular functions and virulence factors [ 30, 31].

Our results indicate that the GacS / GacA two - component system regulates one or several genes that promote bacterial survival in the gut.

This hypothesized persistence - promoting factor may have a function similar to the Erwinia virulence factor ( evf) gene of E. carotovora Ecc15 that promotes persistence of Gram - negative bacteria in the larval gut [ 34].

Finally, our study shows that aprA, but not gacA, mutants of P. entomophila retain a moderate capacity to kill both adult flies and larvae.	"aprA	30	34	Protein"	"gacA	44	48	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We confirmed this expectation by showing that deletions of fliT and aer did not affect motility ( data not shown).

The neutral behavior of the fliT mutation is not surprising since fliT null strains were found to make functional flagella in S. enterica [ 19].	"fliT	28	32	Protein"	"fliT	66	70	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""fliT"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fliT"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Because of this redundancy, only aer tsr double mutants are expected to show a motility phenotype in tryptone plates.

CheZ is a phosphatase of CheY, the protein whose phosphorylated state biases the flagella toward the CW direction [ 26, 27].

Interrogation of genes with high z - scores in the enrichment for mutants incapable of swarming identified two additional genes that impact surface motility: hns, encoding a global transcriptional regulator, and yfiR, encoding a predicted periplasmic protein of unknown function.	"hns	158	161	Protein"	"yfiR	212	216	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""hns"", ""start_span"": 158, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""yfiR"", ""start_span"": 212, ""end_span"": 216, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In - frame deletions of these genes abolished swarming; however, while the Deltahns mutant showed a severe swimming defect, the swimming motility of the DeltayfiR mutant was only mildly impaired ( Figures 3D and 4).

Phosphorylated RcsB is known to bind upstream of the flhDC operon and to repress its expression.

This conclusion is further supported by the dramatic reduction in swimming motility by rcsC137 mutants ( Figure S7), in which the rcsC137 gene product has lost its phosphatase activity [ 40].

These measurements revealed that indeed the flagella of DeltayhjH mutants, while not strictly locked in one direction of rotation, exhibit a strong CCW bias with a rotational switching frequency intermediate between that found in wild - type cells and in DeltacheR mutants ( Figure 6B).	"DeltayhjH	56	65	Protein"	"DeltacheR	255	264	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltayhjH"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""DeltacheR"", ""start_span"": 255, ""end_span"": 264, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Secondary insertional mutations were observed to suppress motility defects in Deltahns and DeltayhjH genetic backgrounds ( Figures 6C and S8A).	"Deltahns	78	86	Protein"	"DeltayhjH	91	100	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Deltahns"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""DeltayhjH"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Among the 18 suppressor mutants sampled at random from the DeltayhjH background, half had insertions in different regions of ycgR, a gene encoding a protein of unknown function ( Figure 6D).

This finding is consistent with a recent report in which the inactivation of ycgR was observed to improve motility of yhjH mutants [ 48].

The cyclase and phosphodiesterase activities have been attributed to GGDEF and EAL protein domains, respectively [ 50, 51], and the activity of these domains is known to have opposite effects on motility [ 52].	"GGDEF	69	74	Protein"	"EAL	79	82	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GGDEF"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""EAL"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
YhjH contains an EAL domain, and expression of this protein leads to the degradation of c - di - GMP and enhanced motility in S. enterica [ 52].	"YhjH	0	4	Protein"	"EAL	17	20	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""YhjH"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""EAL"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Based on this observation and because EAL domain proteins function in the degradation of c - di - GMP, we hypothesized that the motility defect of DeltayhjH ( Figure 1C) is a result of increased intracellular levels of c - di - GMP.	"EAL	38	41	Protein"	"DeltayhjH	147	156	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""EAL"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""DeltayhjH"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, a single GGDEF / EAL composite protein exhibiting concomitant DGC and PDE activities has not been reported.

Deletion of yegE and over - expression of yfgF did not have significant effects on the motility of the wild - type strain ( unpublished data).

If c - di - GMP levels act globally and can influence motility, then insertions in many of the genes containing active GGDEF domains should rescue motility in the DeltayhjH double mutant library.

However, it has been reported that c - di - GMP binds to the PilZ domain of the aforementioned YcgR protein [ 48].

It is hypothesized that YcgR undergoes a conformational change upon binding to c - di - GMP, and that the YcgR - c - di - GMP complex impairs motility through a protein - protein interaction with the flagellar motor [ 57].

The observations that the DeltayhjH mutant is impaired in swimming but indistinguishable from the wild - type strain in swarming, while in contrast the DeltayfiR strain cannot swarm and is only mildly impaired in swimming, support the notion that c - di - GMP signaling pathways are temporally and / or spatially separated, as recently suggested by others [ 58, 59].

Finally, the Fsr system, a major positive and negative transcriptional regulator in OG1RF [ 22], affects expression of several virulence factor genes, including gelE, which encodes gelatinase [ 23], and contributes to infection in various animal models [ 15, 24].

Our analysis of this area in OG1RF revealed the presence of an additional 14. 8 kb fragment inserted between the corresponding EF1826 and EF1827 of OG1RF ( confirmed by PCR; results not shown).

OG1RF does not contain homologues of EF2248 - 54 ( carrying instead the iol operon), though it has a novel WxL locus within the 14. 8 kb unique region upstream of the fsr locus ( Additional data file 2).

It is interesting to note that while several of these WxL loci, including the EF0750 and EF3184 loci, were present by hybridization in all the strains ( clinical or food isolates) tested by Lepage et al.

A gene ( OG1RF _ 0191) encoding an M15 family muramoyl pentapeptide carboxypeptidase is located downstream of these two - component regulatory genes ( Figure 4a).

However, OG1RF _ 0191 lacks an identifiable transmembrane domain that is important to the VanY function and it is likely, therefore, that this protein may be a soluble D, D - carboxypeptidase / transpeptidase as seen in Streptomyces [ 39] and Actinomadura [ 40], and thus may not be involved in peptidoglycan metabolism.

Also, the OG1RF operon carries two copies of an iolG - like gene, which encodes inositol 2 - dehydrogenase, the first enzyme of the myo - inositol degradation pathway ( Figure 5).

To verify that the iol genes are responsible for the fermentation of myo - inositol in OG1RF, transposon insertion mutants [ 9] in the iolB and iolG2 genes of OG1RF were tested.

Relative changes in protein abundance between DeltasmpB or Deltahfq mutant strains and a wild - type strain were evaluated across four differing growth conditions.

Across each of the four growth conditions examined our analysis revealed that Hfq had a far more significant effect on the Salmonella Typhimurium proteome than SmpB.

Overall, in comparison to expression in the parent strain, Hfq and SmpB altered, approximately50% ( 781proteins) and approximately12% ( 189 proteins) of the observed proteome ( 1621 proteins) respectively, as determined by an ANOVA analysis ( p < 0. 05) using the computer program DAnTE [ 30] ( Table S1).

Considering the reported pleitropic nature of deletion of hfq on the biology of Salmonella Typhimurium it is likely that a proportion of the changes in protein abundances maybe a non - specific and / or secondary consequence of hfq deletion.

[ 10] showed an approximately 25% overlap ( Table S2), similar to the approximately30% overlap observed between data from a transcriptional analysis of an Deltahfq mutant strain and data from a co - IP analysis of Hfq - associated mRNAs [ 10].

Considering that we observe 36% ( 1621 orfs) of the entire Salmonella proteome ( 4450 orfs) and that 50% ( 781 orfs) of this observed proteome ( 1621 orfs) is modulated by Hfq, it would be expected that a significant portion of the unobserved Salmonella proteome ( 2829 orfs) would also be regulated by Hfq, thus our assertion that the approximately20% value may very well represent an underestimation.

Examination of transcript levels using microarray analysis ( > / = 2 - fold change) revealed a more modest effect on Salmonella transcription, with approximately11% ( 492 genes) and approximately8% ( 370 genes) of the Salmonella Typhimurium genome ( 4550 genes; [ 31]) under control of Hfq and SmpB, respectively ( Table S4).

One of these preserved factors is the highly potent DNase, Sda1, which destroys neutrophil extracellular traps, NETs [ 36], protecting the bacteria from neutrophil killing, promoting bacterial invasion, and facilitating human plasminogen - mediated bacterial dissemination into normally sterile sites, which results in invasive infections [ 14].

Likewise, some genes are only induced in AP - vivo, including those encoding the toxin / enzyme streptokinase and a RofA / Nra - like transcriptional regulator ( Fig. 2, CC10).

Although CovS is expected to modulate many known CovR - repressed subsystems, certain operons may be differentially modulated or may be influenced by other regulator ( s).

Alternatively, the mutation in covS may have different effects on CovR - mediated regulation of different genes [ 26].

In fact, our in vivo data show that covR itself is downregulated in vivo in both WT and AP strains ( Fig. 2, CC2 and Table S1); however, the SLS operon is upregulated in vivo in WT bacteria, suggesting that its regulation is not solely modulated by CovRS.	"covR	36	40	Protein"	"CovRS	249	254	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""covR"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CovRS"", ""start_span"": 249, ""end_span"": 254, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It is possible that SLS is regulated by the catabolite control protein ( CcpA), which was recently shown to be another key transcriptional regulator of the SLS operon [ 46] and which may override CovR - mediated repression of SLS.

SpeB is a major virulence factor in GAS pathogenesis and its expression is regulated by different systems [ 40], [ 56], [ 57], [ 58], including the CovRS system [ 20], [ 53].	"SpeB	0	4	Protein"	"CovRS	148	153	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SpeB"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CovRS"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In addition, the downregulation of SpeB, EndoS, and CAMP is in agreement with our previous proteomic results [ 12] as well as other published transcriptional analyses [ 13], [ 27].	"SpeB	35	39	Protein"	"EndoS	41	46	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SpeB"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""EndoS"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
On the other hand, genes encoding the fibrinolytic enzyme streptokinase, Ska, a RofA - like transcriptional regulator, several cell division proteins, and some phage proteins were only upregulated when the AP bacteria sensed the in vivo environment ( AP - vivo, Fig. 2, CC10).	"Ska	73	76	Protein"	"RofA	80	84	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Ska"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RofA"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
"This finding suggests that AP bacteria are somehow "" pre - adapted "" to invasiveness and, consequently, when injected into mice, they do not undergo much virulence - related changes as they already possess a thicker capsule, lack a functional SpeB, are equipped with surface virulence proteins, and secrete ready - to - use toxins, including the potent DNase, Sda1."	"SpeB	243	247	Protein"	"Sda1	360	364	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SpeB"", ""start_span"": 243, ""end_span"": 247, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Sda1"", ""start_span"": 360, ""end_span"": 364, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It is noteworthy that SpeB expression has a dominant effect, since even if secreted in low amounts by a minor subpopulation, this broad - spectrum protease would still be able to degrade, fully or partially, many GAS virulence proteins, including Sda1, thereby rendering the bacteria vulnerable to different effector mechanisms of the host ' s innate immune system including neutrophil killing [ 14], [ 67], [ 68].

This dominant SpeB effect may explain why WT bacteria parish in vivo even though they partially downregulate SpeB transcription ( Table 3).

An intact CovRS system would offer the bacteria enough versatility to turn on and off many regulatory networks through CovS signaling.

( 4) We also show that the impact of the covS mutation goes beyond the defined CovR regulon.

Recently, the novel two - component regulatory system Sak188 / Sak189 was identified.

In S. agalactiae genome, it was adjacent to the bac gene encoding for beta - antigen, an important virulence factor.

Finally, insertional inactivation of sak189 gene, but not sak188 gene, significantly affected virulent properties of S. agalactiae.

In addition, inactivation of histidine kinase gene rgfC resulted in increased transcription of scpB gene [ 12].

Recently, putative two - component regulatory system genes encoding for sensor histidine kinase ( sak188) and DNA - binding response regulator ( sak189) were identified in S. agalactiae strains 98 - D60C and A909 [ 13], [ 14].

In addition, some regions of CbpA protein has the certain similarity with beta - antigen.

Inactivation of RR06 in S. pneumoniae resulted in the loss of CbpA expression [ 22] - [ 24].

HK06 / RR06 was also important for the ability of pneumococci to adhere to epithelial cells in vitro and to survive and proliferate in an in vivo mouse model [ 22].

The goal of the present study was to investigate the function of S. agalactiae Sak188 / Sak189 TCS.	"Sak188	79	85	Protein"	"Sak189	88	94	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sak188"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Sak189"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Briefly, DNA fragments of sak188 and sak189 genes were PCR amplified using pairs of primers hkFor, hkRev, and rrFor, rrRev ( Table 1), respectively.	"sak188	26	32	Protein"	"sak189	37	43	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""sak188"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak189"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Western - blotting with labeled human IgA identified this protein as beta - antigen ( Fig. 3).	"IgA	38	41	Protein"	"beta - antigen	69	83	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IgA"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""beta - antigen"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
On the other hand, the bac gene transcription level in sak188 mutant strain was almost similar to that in the wild - type strain that confirmed the results of SDS - PAGE and western - blotting.	"bac	23	26	Protein"	"sak188	55	61	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bac"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak188"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, these data demonstrate that Sak189 protein regulates expression of beta - antigen at transcriptional level.	"Sak189	34	40	Protein"	"beta - antigen	73	87	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sak189"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""beta - antigen"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Finally, insertional inactivation of sak189 gene, but not sak188 gene, significantly affects virulent properties of S. agalactiae.	"sak189	37	43	Protein"	"sak188	58	64	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""sak189"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak188"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In some strains, the mutations in bac gene resulted in expression of truncated non - functional forms of beta - antigen [ 39], [ 40].	"bac	34	37	Protein"	"beta - antigen	105	119	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bac"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""beta - antigen"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In present study, the sak188 and sak189 genes of S. agalactiae were inactivated.	"sak188	22	28	Protein"	"sak189	33	39	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""sak188"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak189"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Given that insertional inactivation does not delete the entire gene from the chromosome and often results in truncated or modified protein, we analyzed which functional activities of Sak188 and Sak189 proteins could potentially retain if the modified proteins expressed.	"Sak188	183	189	Protein"	"Sak189	194	200	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sak188"", ""start_span"": 183, ""end_span"": 189, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Sak189"", ""start_span"": 194, ""end_span"": 200, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Similarly, ATP - binding and Mg2 + - binding sites located at C - terminal end of Sak188, which are essential for phosphorylation, were lost in Sak188 protein due to the mutagenesis.	"Sak188	82	88	Protein"	"Sak188	144	150	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sak188"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Sak188"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, we can not rule out the possibility of a cross - talk between Sak189 response regulator and sensor kinase ( s) in S. agalactiae, and Sak189 can potentially recruit another histidine kinase for proper functioning.	"Sak189	68	74	Protein"	"Sak189	139	145	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sak189"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Sak189"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In the present study, insertional inactivation of sak189 gene abrogated beta - antigen expression but resulted in increased virulence ( Fig. 4).	"sak189	50	56	Protein"	"beta - antigen	72	86	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""sak189"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""beta - antigen"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The difference among the growth curves of the wild - type and mutant strains ( data not shown) indicate that in addition to bac gene, some metabolic genes can be controlled by Sak188 / Sak189 TCS.

This suggestion is confirmed by the numerous studies demonstrating the genome - wide location of the genes affected by TCSs [ 10], [ 42], [ 43], and set of the genes controlled by Sak188 / Sak189 ( TCS regulon) can be identified using microarray technology.

As seen from the data of this study, transcription of bac gene and expression of encoded beta - antigen are the primary genotypic / phenotypic properties controlled by Sak188 / Sak189 TCS.

In conclusion, the data presented here characterize the functional role of S. agalactiae Sak188 / Sak189 two - component system.

Both transcription of bac gene and expression of encoded beta - antigen are controlled by Sak189 response regulator, and the regulation occurs at transcriptional level.
