The low Mg2 + activation of the PmrA protein requires PhoQ, a protein that senses extracellular Mg2 + levels ( Vescovi et al., 1996), PhoQ ' s cognate regulator PhoP, and the PhoP - activated protein PmrD ( Kox et al., 2000; Kato and Groisman, 2004).

This acid pH - promoted increase appears to be specific to a subset of PhoP - activated genes ( our unpublished results) that includes pmrD because expression of the PhoP - regulated slyA gene and the PhoP - independent corA gene was not affected by the pH of the medium ( Fig. 4A).

HilC and HilD, which are members of the AraC / XylS family, have been postulated to act as a derepressor of hilA expression by counteracting the action of negative regulatory elements at the hilA promoter ( 12, 13).

Additionally, the over - expression of HilD from the plasmid pJB3 containing hilD gene under the control of a lac promoter caused the induction of hilA by approximately2 - fold and invF by approximately6 - fold irrespective of hilE or mlc mutation when real - time PCR was used to compare the expression levels ( data not shown).

On the negative strand of 89K, peptides encoded by 05SSU0944 and 05SSU0943 exhibit 27% and 41% amino acid sequence identity with the SalK and the SalR proteins of Streptococcus salivarius, respectively, forming a TCSTS belonging to the Nar / LuxR family.

Downstream of salKR, the 05SSU0942, 05SSU0941, 05SSU0940, 05SSU0939, 05SSU0938 genes were predicted to encode peptides with significant identities to the orthologues of Streptococcus agalactiae.

In order to examine the effect of sigmaE ( rpoE) on the expression of a broad range of SsrB - regulated virulence genes, we tested whether or not the effect of rpoE deletion was specific to sseB or if it extended to other SsrB - regulated genes.
