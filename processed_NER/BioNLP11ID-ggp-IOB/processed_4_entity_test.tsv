The Toll pathway is mainly activated by Gram - positive bacteria and fungi, and controls, to a large extent, the expression of AMPs ( e. g., Drosomycin) through the nuclear factor - kappaB transactivators Dif and Dorsal.

In contrast, the Imd pathway mainly responds to Gram - negative bacterial infections and controls different AMP genes ( e. g., Diptericin) via the activation of the nuclear factor - kappaB transactivator Relish ( Rel) [ 3, 4, 6].

Studies in other bacteria have shown that AprD, E, and F participate in the elaboration of a Type I transporter required for AprA secretion to the external medium [ 17].

Diptericin was expressed at a wild - type level following oral infection with the aprA and prtR mutants, but no expression was detected in the case of the gacA mutant ( Figures 2C and 5A).

The observation that AprA was required to promote persistence in wild - type flies and larvae but was dispensable in a Rel background, indicates that AprA plays an important role in the protection against the Imd - dependent immune response.

Use of Diptericin - GFP or lacZ reporter genes reveals strong Diptericin expression in the proventriculus, an organ that acts as a valve between the oesophagus and the anterior midgut ( Figure 5B).

In agreement with previous studies, we show that aprA expression in P. entomophila depends on both PrtR and the GacS / GacA system.

The Rcs pathway consists of a phosphotransfer protein ( RcsD) that mediates phosphate transfer from a sensor kinase ( RcsC) to a response regulator ( RcsB) that binds DNA with an accessory protein ( RcsA).

Based on the known antagonistic effects of c - di - GMP on motility [ 52] and by following several lines of reasoning, we hypothesized the dominant enzymatic activities of the GGDEF and EAL domains in YfgF and YegE.

Our finding that the EnvZ / OmpR signaling pathway mediates motility suppression in high [ NaCl] is consistent with previous work that found phosphorylated OmpR to negatively regulate the expression of flagella by interacting with the promoter region of flhDC [ 66].

OG1RF carries two CRISPR elements: CRISPR1 ( between the OG1RF homologue of EF0672 and EF0673) and CRISPR2 ( between the OG1RF homologue of EF2062 and EF2063); CRISPR1 is linked to cas - like genes while CRISPR2 is not ( Figure 3).

The four cas genes encode Cas _ csn1 ( possible endonuclease), Cas1 ( novel nuclease), Cas2 ( conserved hypothetical protein), and Cas _ csn2 ( conserved hypothetical protein).

To determine the distribution of the CRISPR1 locus in E. faecalis strains, 16 isolates of various MLST types were tested for the presence ( PCR with primers specific for csn1 and cas1) or absence ( PCR with primers overlapping the junction between EF0672 and EF0673) of the CRISPR1 locus ( Table 2).

OG1RF _ 0186 ( corresponding to EF2505 of V583) has four repeats compared to seven in V583, and OG1RF _ 0165 ( corresponding to EF2224 of V583) has eight repeats compared to five in V583.

However, OG1RF _ 0186 carries fewer repeats than EF2505 while Ace and OG1RF _ 0165 carry more repeats than their counterparts in V583, suggesting that our observation does not fit this hypothesis or that the peptidoglycan depth is not uniform.

Apart from these three MSCRAMMs with B - repeat polymorphisms, we identified two unique MSCRAMM proteins in OG1RF: a homologue of EF0089 ( OG1RF _ 0063, which shares 48% similarity) and a homologue of EF1896 ( OG1RF _ 0039, which shares 75% similarity); both are located in the approximately 49 kb region unique to OG1RF described below ( Figure 1; Additional data file 1).

The other ComDE homology is that with a two - component system unique to OG1RF ( OG1RF _ 0199 and OG1RF _ 0198, respectively) that lies on a 4, 706 bp unique fragment that maps between EF3114 and EF3115 in V583.

This fragment also carries two genes ( OG1RF _ 0200 and OG1RF _ 0201) encoding homologues of the YhaQ and YhaP sodium efflux ATP - binding cassette efflux / transporter proteins ( Figure 4b).

In this study we utilize a SpeB - negative M1T1 clinical isolate, 5628, with a naturally occurring mutation in the gene encoding the regulator RopB, to elucidate the role of RopB and SpeB in systemic virulence.	"SpeB	27	31	Protein"	"RopB	143	147	Protein"	"RopB	174	178	Protein"	"SpeB	183	187	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SpeB"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RopB"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 147, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RopB"", ""start_span"": 174, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SpeB"", ""start_span"": 183, ""end_span"": 187, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, SpeB has also been shown to cleave a range of GAS proteins such as the fibrinogen - binding M1 protein [ 14], [ 15], various superantigens [ 16], [ 17], the secreted plasminogen activator streptokinase [ 18] as well as the DNase Sda1 [ 17], and thus possibly interfere with the proven virulence functions of these bacterial factors.

No mutations were found in the strain 5628 in the speB gene nor in the covR / S locus, which has been previously linked to loss of SpeB expression [ 37], [ 38].

Strain 5628RDeltaSpeB containing a full - length RopB but lacking SpeB also showed reduced virulence, suggesting that the reduced virulence of 5628 may primarily result from the lack of SpeB expression in this strain.

In this report we have used global proteomics to directly identify proteins regulated by Hfq or SmpB by comparing protein abundance in the parent and isogenic hfq or smpB mutant.

Identifying what proteins are actually regulated by Hfq and SmpB is an important step in understanding the impact of post - transcriptional gene regulation in Enterobacteria and more specifically how Hfq and SmpB control Salmonella gene expression at the post - transcriptional / translational level and the role that this may play in Salmonella pathogenesis.

To address the role of Hfq and SmpB in Salmonella Typhimurium pathogenesis and protein synthesis we first constructed non - polar deletion mutations of the hfq and smpB genes using a modified pKD13 derivative as the template.

To directly assess the role of Hfq and SmpB in Salmonella Typhimurium pathogenesis, BALB / c mice were infected intraperitoneally with 200 cfu of either Deltahfq mutant strain, DeltasmpB mutant strain or wildtype strain and monitored for 21 days ( Figure 1).

The absence of smpB and hfq attenuated Salmonella virulence; mice infected with the DeltasmpB mutant strain died at 10 days post - infection while mice infected with the Deltahfq mutant strain were fully resistant to the infection.

Overall, the transcription data showed fewer discernable patterns of regulation by Hfq or SmpB relative to the proteome analysis, and comparison across all growth conditions revealed little overlap in proteins and transcripts regulated by either Hfq or SmpB ( Figure 3).

These observations are in agreement with the recently suggested role of Hfq in envelope stress based on lacZ translational fusions [ 34] as well as the observation that rpoE is translationally regulated by Hfq [ 10].

Both microarray analysis and confirmative qRT - PCR assays showed that RNA levels were unchanged for pduA and pduE genes in the Deltahfq mutant strain compared to the wildtype strain ( Figure 5), thus showing that Hfq represses translation in these two environmental conditions.

For example it was possible that Hfq directly modulates translation of smpB and therefore all of the effects observed for smpB could be related to Hfq.

We performed a sample - matched global proteomics and transcriptional analysis to examine the broad impacts of deletion mutants of hfq and smpB on global protein and transcript abundance levels to begin to understand how Hfq and SmpB mediate the control of global gene expression at the post - transcriptional level.

Further strengthening this hypothesis is the fact that two subunits from DNA polymerase III ( dnaN, dnaX), which is the primary enzyme for replicative DNA functions in E. coli, are down - regulated, as well the genes coding for the DNA primase ( dnaG) and the cell division protein FtsX.

PCR analysis of the bac gene positive strains revealed that the presence of bac gene correlated with the presence of sensor histidine kinase gene sak188 and DNA - binding response regulator gene sak189 ( data not shown).

To investigate a functional role of the two - component regulatory system Sak188 / Sak189 in S. agalactiae, the sak188 and sak189 genes were inactivated by insertional mutagenesis ( Fig. 2).

It was demonstrated that both transcription of bac gene and expression of encoded beta - antigen were controlled by the Sak189 response regulator, but not Sak188 histidine kinase.

Comparative analysis of Sak188 and Sak189 amino acid sequences in the wild - type strain 168 / 00 and deduced protein sequences in mutant strains predicted the replacement of 95 amino acids at the C - terminal end of Sak188 protein by 191 amino acids, and replacement of 51 amino acids at the C - terminal end of Sak189 protein by 15 amino acids ( Fig. 5).

In S. pneumoniae, inactivation of the response regulator RR06 ( 83% similarity with Sak189), which binds promoter region of cbpA, repressed transcription of the cbpA gene [ 22].	"RR06	57	61	Protein"	"Sak189	84	90	Protein"	"cbpA	124	128	Protein"	"cbpA	161	165	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RR06"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Sak189"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cbpA"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cbpA"", ""start_span"": 161, ""end_span"": 165, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In this study, western blotting and quantitative RT - PCR revealed that DNA - binding response regulator Sak189 is necessary for beta - antigen expression suggesting direct binding of Sak189 with bac gene promoter.	"Sak189	105	111	Protein"	"beta - antigen	129	143	Protein"	"Sak189	184	190	Protein"	"bac	196	199	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sak189"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""beta - antigen"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Sak189"", ""start_span"": 184, ""end_span"": 190, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""bac"", ""start_span"": 196, ""end_span"": 199, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Given that insertional inactivation of sak188 gene does not affect beta - antigen expression, we suggest that beta - antigen expression can be activated independently of Sak188, perhaps through small - molecular - weight phosphodonors such as acetyl phosphate or other noncognate histidine kinases.
