P. entomophila gacA mutants are non - pathogenic and fail to trigger a systemic immune response after ingestion, indicating that the GacS / GacA two - component system regulates important bacterial virulence effectors required to infect and kill flies [ 9].	"gacA	15	19	Protein"	"GacS	133	137	Protein"	"GacA	140	144	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GacS"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GacA"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In P. fluorescens, membrane - localized anti - sigma factor PrtR cleaves the extracytoplasmic sigma factor PrtI, resulting in increased expression of multiple genes, including one encoding for a metalloprotease, aprX [ 16].	"PrtR	60	64	Protein"	"PrtI	107	111	Protein"	"aprX	212	216	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PrtR"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PrtI"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""aprX"", ""start_span"": 212, ""end_span"": 216, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To test a possible role of prtR in the regulation of aprA expression, we analyzed the proteins present in the supernatant of prtR mutants.	"prtR	27	31	Protein"	"aprA	53	57	Protein"	"prtR	125	129	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""prtR"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""prtR"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Measurement of in vitro protease activity with azocasein revealed that the gacA mutant secretes no detectable protease activity and that prtR mutants retain only 30% of wild - type supernatant activity, thus indicating a role for PrtR in the regulation of P. entomophila protease secretion ( Figure 1F).	"gacA	75	79	Protein"	"prtR	137	141	Protein"	"PrtR	230	234	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""prtR"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PrtR"", ""start_span"": 230, ""end_span"": 234, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Using the same assay, both prtR and gacA mutants were almost avirulent toward Drosophila indicating that both genes regulate other virulence factors in addition to AprA ( Figure 2B).	"prtR	27	31	Protein"	"gacA	36	40	Protein"	"AprA	164	168	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""prtR"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 168, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Whereas this food - uptake cessation was still observed in aprA and prtR mutants, it was not evident in gacA mutant - infected larvae ( Figure 2D and data not shown for prtR).	"aprA	59	63	Protein"	"prtR	68	72	Protein"	"gacA	104	108	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""prtR"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The data presented above clearly indicate that AprA is a major virulence factor of P. entomophila that promotes bacterial persistence and killing of the host, but that other virulence factors controlled by gacA and prtR exist.	"AprA	47	51	Protein"	"gacA	206	210	Protein"	"prtR	215	219	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 206, ""end_span"": 210, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""prtR"", ""start_span"": 215, ""end_span"": 219, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Our previous study had already revealed that the humoral arm of the Drosophila immune response mediated by the Imd pathway contributes to resistance against orally transmitted P. entomophila, since flies mutated in the Relish ( Rel) gene showed a consistently increased mortality rate [ 9].	"Imd	111	114	Protein"	"Relish	219	225	Protein"	"Rel	228	231	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Relish"", ""start_span"": 219, ""end_span"": 225, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Rel"", ""start_span"": 228, ""end_span"": 231, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Whereas the titer of gacA mutants decreased with time, we observed that the aprA derivative persisted at a level similar to wild - type bacteria in Rel - deficient mutant flies and larvae ( Figure 3A and 3B, and unpublished data).	"gacA	21	25	Protein"	"aprA	76	80	Protein"	"Rel	148	151	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Rel"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It is interesting to note that in agreement with the results described above, persistence of both the aprA mutant and wild - type bacteria was significantly altered in fly lines over - expressing the Imd pathway, and that aprA mutants survived less than wild - type bacteria ( Figure 4B).	"aprA	102	106	Protein"	"Imd	200	203	Protein"	"aprA	222	226	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 200, ""end_span"": 203, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 222, ""end_span"": 226, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To ascertain that the protection was due to Imd pathway activation and not to a competition between P. entomophila and Ecc15, we next monitored resistance to P. entomophila of wild - type and Rel flies orally infected by Ecc15 evf -.	"Imd	44	47	Protein"	"Rel	192	195	Protein"	"evf	227	230	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Rel"", ""start_span"": 192, ""end_span"": 195, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""evf"", ""start_span"": 227, ""end_span"": 230, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, we next compared survival of Rel flies specifically expressing a wild - type copy of Rel in the intestine using caudal ( cad) - Gal4.	"Rel	35	38	Protein"	"Rel	91	94	Protein"	"Gal4	134	138	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rel"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Rel"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Gal4"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Figure 5E shows that Rel flies expressing Rel in the gut survive better than Rel mutant flies.	"Rel	21	24	Protein"	"Rel	42	45	Protein"	"Rel	77	80	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rel"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Rel"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Rel"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The Imd pathway regulates a large number of immune genes including those encoding AMPs; and two peptides, Diptericin and Attacin, are preferentially synthesized following bacterial infection in the digestive tract of Drosophila [ 7].	"Imd	4	7	Protein"	"Diptericin	106	116	Protein"	"Attacin	121	128	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Diptericin"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Attacin"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The difference in pathogenicity exhibited by gacA, prtR, and aprA mutants underlines the complexity of P. entomophila virulence factors.	"gacA	45	49	Protein"	"prtR	51	55	Protein"	"aprA	61	65	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""prtR"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The observation that both aprA and prtR, but not gacA, mutants retained the capacity to trigger a systemic immune response indicates a clear distinction between pathogenicity and immune activation.	"aprA	26	30	Protein"	"prtR	35	39	Protein"	"gacA	49	53	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""prtR"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Another interesting feature of P. entomophila virulence is the food - uptake cessation which is observed in prtR and aprA but not in gacA mutants.	"prtR	108	112	Protein"	"aprA	117	121	Protein"	"gacA	133	137	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""prtR"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The three remaining motility genes that were not significantly enriched are two chemoreceptor genes, trg and aer, and the filament cap chaperone, fliT.	"trg	101	104	Protein"	"aer	109	112	Protein"	"fliT	146	150	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""trg"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""aer"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fliT"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In addition, it has been reported that fliT mutations enhance expression of class 2 flagellar operons [ 20] because FliT acts as a negative regulator of these operons by binding to and inhibiting the activity of FlhDC [ 21].	"fliT	39	43	Protein"	"FliT	116	120	Protein"	"FlhDC	212	217	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""fliT"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FliT"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FlhDC"", ""start_span"": 212, ""end_span"": 217, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To investigate this possibility, we introduced flhDC - lacZ translational fusions in the deletion strains and performed beta - galactosidase assays.	"flhDC	47	52	Protein"	"lacZ	55	59	Protein"	"beta - galactosidase	120	140	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""flhDC"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""lacZ"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""beta - galactosidase"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Surprisingly, a large fraction of the mutants tested showed significant reduction in flhDC - lacZ expression values relative to the wild - type strain, demonstrating that the motility defects can be partly attributed to reduced expression of the flhDC operon.	"flhDC	85	90	Protein"	"lacZ	93	97	Protein"	"flhDC	246	251	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""flhDC"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""lacZ"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""flhDC"", ""start_span"": 246, ""end_span"": 251, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We found that deletion of rcsB, rcsD, or rcsF was sufficient to rescue motility in both LPS and OPG mutants ( Figure S6), providing strong evidence that perturbations in these structures repress motility by signaling through the Rcs pathway.	"rcsB	26	30	Protein"	"rcsD	32	36	Protein"	"rcsF	41	45	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""rcsB"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""rcsD"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""rcsF"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We also observed that sensitivity to chi - phage was higher in rfaI mutants than rfaC mutants, indicating that chi - phage infectivity is directly related to the degree of flhDC expression ( Figures 4, 5B, and 5C).	"rfaI	63	67	Protein"	"rfaC	81	85	Protein"	"flhDC	172	177	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""rfaI"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""rfaC"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""flhDC"", ""start_span"": 172, ""end_span"": 177, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Based on these observations, we hypothesized that this mutant has flagella with an extreme CCW rotation bias, a phenotype also exhibited, to varying degrees, by cheA, cheR, and cheW mutants [ 43].	"cheA	161	165	Protein"	"cheR	167	171	Protein"	"cheW	177	181	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cheA"", ""start_span"": 161, ""end_span"": 165, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheR"", ""start_span"": 167, ""end_span"": 171, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheW"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 181, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
First, chi - phage infectivity assays with DeltayhjH mutants showed comparable levels of infection to cheR mutants ( which exhibit CCW flagellar rotation bias) in contrast to the reduced sensitivity displayed by cheZ mutants ( which have CW flagellar rotation bias), consistent with the z - scores of our chi - phage selection ( Figure 5E).	"DeltayhjH	43	52	Protein"	"cheR	102	106	Protein"	"cheZ	212	216	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltayhjH"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheR"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheZ"", ""start_span"": 212, ""end_span"": 216, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In a final functional test, individual cells of four different strains - wild - type cells and mutants with yhjH, cheR, and cheZ deletions - were tethered to a microscope slide and the frequency of flagellar rotation switching was measured using computer tracking software in a fashion similar to Block et al.	"yhjH	108	112	Protein"	"cheR	114	118	Protein"	"cheZ	124	128	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""yhjH"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheR"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheZ"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The other half of DeltayhjH suppressor mutations were found to contain insertions within the intergenic region between the divergently transcribed genes yfgF and yfgG, which encode gene products of unknown function.	"DeltayhjH	18	27	Protein"	"yfgF	153	157	Protein"	"yfgG	162	166	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltayhjH"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""yfgF"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""yfgG"", ""start_span"": 162, ""end_span"": 166, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, deletions of either yfgF or yfgG produced no measurable difference in motility in the DeltayhjH background ( Figure S9).	"yfgF	29	33	Protein"	"yfgG	37	41	Protein"	"DeltayhjH	95	104	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""yfgF"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""yfgG"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""DeltayhjH"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Conversely, overexpression of yfgF ( but not yfgG) was found to suppress the motility defect of DeltayhjH mutants ( Figure 6E).	"yfgF	30	34	Protein"	"yfgG	45	49	Protein"	"DeltayhjH	96	105	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""yfgF"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""yfgG"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""DeltayhjH"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The mechanisms by which deletion of yegE and overexpression of yfgF suppress the motility defect of DeltayhjH mutants are discussed in the next section.	"yegE	36	40	Protein"	"yfgF	63	67	Protein"	"DeltayhjH	100	109	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""yegE"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""yfgF"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""DeltayhjH"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Based on sequence homology, YhjH, YfgF, and YegE belong to the newly identified and highly prevalent family of proteins that function in the turnover of bis - ( 3 ' - 5 ') - cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate ( c - di - GMP), which is a second messenger involved in the regulation of a wide variety of bacterial behaviors [ 49].	"YhjH	28	32	Protein"	"YfgF	34	38	Protein"	"YegE	44	48	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""YhjH"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""YfgF"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""YegE"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Based on these observations, we propose that deleting yegE and over - expressing yfgF suppress the motility defect of the DeltayhjH strain by reducing the intracellular levels of c - di - GMP ( Figure 7).	"yegE	54	58	Protein"	"yfgF	81	85	Protein"	"DeltayhjH	122	131	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""yegE"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""yfgF"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""DeltayhjH"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Such an interaction may explain the observed rotational bias of flagella in DeltayhjH mutants ( Figure 6B) and is in agreement with our finding that mutations in ycgR strongly suppress the motility defects of DeltayhjH mutants ( Figure 6F).	"DeltayhjH	76	85	Protein"	"ycgR	162	166	Protein"	"DeltayhjH	209	218	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltayhjH"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ycgR"", ""start_span"": 162, ""end_span"": 166, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""DeltayhjH"", ""start_span"": 209, ""end_span"": 218, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The yfiR gene is the first in an operon that also contains yfiN and yfiB ( inset of Figure 7).	"yfiR	4	8	Protein"	"yfiN	59	63	Protein"	"yfiB	68	72	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""yfiR"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""yfiN"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""yfiB"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Mutations in ycgR were also found to suppress the swarming defect of the DeltayfiR strain ( unpublished data), suggesting that YcgR binds c - di - GMP to affect both swimming and swarming motility.	"ycgR	13	17	Protein"	"DeltayfiR	73	82	Protein"	"YcgR	127	131	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ycgR"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""DeltayfiR"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""YcgR"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The fimS mutant exhibited a level of fimbriation similar to fimB - fimE - double mutants locked in phase ON ( Figure S11A), indicating that a high level of fimbriation reduces motility in semi - solid agar.	"fimS	4	8	Protein"	"fimB	60	64	Protein"	"fimE	67	71	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""fimS"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fimB"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fimE"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This observation is confirmed by comparing the motility of the fimS mutant to phase ON fimB - fimE - double mutants ( Figure S11B).

The absence / presence of the 23. 9 kb region, from EF1820 / fsrC to EF1841, did not appear to correlate with the clinical origin of the isolates [ 30].

Finally, as previously found using PCR, the cpsCDEFGHIJK operon capsule polysaccharide genes [ 37] were confirmed here as missing, although OG1RF carries the cpsA and cpsB genes, which were proposed to be essential for E. faecalis since all strains tested by Hufnagel et al.

However, an OG1RF - unique two - component system with high homology with the vanG locus was found at the location corresponding to the region between EF2860 and EF2861 in V583 ( Table 3).

OG1RF _ 0193 shares 82% similarity with VanRG and 81% similarity with VanRG2.

In Streptococcus pneumoniae [ 50], the competence operon is tightly regulated by a quorum sensing two - component system ( ComDE) and a competence - stimulating peptide ( CSP; encoded by comC).

Searching for a possible CSP in the vicinity of these genes, we identified a small ORF encoding 50 amino acids between yhaP and OG1RF199 and another encoding 20 amino acids downstream of OG1RF198.

The existence of a SpeB - negative invasive phenotype has been hypothesized that results from mutations in the regulator covR / S [ 9].

In this study we examined the effect of a natural mutation in the gene encoding the regulator RopB ( also known as Rgg [ 22]) identified in a SpeB - negative GAS clinical isolate.	"RopB	94	98	Protein"	"Rgg	115	118	Protein"	"SpeB	142	146	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RopB"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Rgg"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SpeB"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
RopB is a GAS transcriptional regulator that has been shown to be essential for expression of SpeB and binds directly to the promoter region of speB [ 23], [ 24].

All colonies sequenced were found to have substitution mutations in covR / S resulting in truncation of CovS.

This finding reveals that when SpeB - negative colonies are selected for in vivo, this selection is predominantly a phenomenon associated with CovR / S inactivation.

In addition to the SpeB operon, genes of the streptolysin S operon were also found to be strongly down - regulated in the ropB mutant strain.

The two strains containing a truncated RopB ( 5628 and 5448R -) demonstrated similarly reduced virulence compared to the two strains containing a full - length RopB ( 5628R + and 5448) ( Fig. 4B), confirming that inactivation of RopB results in decreased virulence in systemic infection.	"RopB	39	43	Protein"	"RopB	160	164	Protein"	"RopB	229	233	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RopB"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RopB"", ""start_span"": 160, ""end_span"": 164, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RopB"", ""start_span"": 229, ""end_span"": 233, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Recently, we and others have found a connection between inactivation of SpeB through mutation in the two - component regulatory system covR / S and development of invasive disease in the murine model [ 37], [ 38].	"SpeB	72	76	Protein"	"covR	135	139	Protein"	"S	142	143	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SpeB"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""covR"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""S"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Of the down - regulated genes in CovR / S mutant strains, SpeB would appear to be one of the most important due to its ability to degrade many host and self - proteins.	"CovR	33	37	Protein"	"S	40	41	Protein"	"SpeB	58	62	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CovR"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""S"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SpeB"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In this study we found that SpeB - positive bacteria with a restored RopB reverted to a SpeB - negative phenotype on subcutaneous infection.	"SpeB	28	32	Protein"	"RopB	69	73	Protein"	"SpeB	88	92	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SpeB"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RopB"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SpeB"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore, the switch to a SpeB - negative phenotype appeared to occur exclusively through mutations in covR / S.	"SpeB	29	33	Protein"	"covR	106	110	Protein"	"S	113	114	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SpeB"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""covR"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""S"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This result suggests that covR / S mutations are the predominant method of phenotypic switching in GAS and that ropB mutation is not readily selected for in vivo.	"covR	26	30	Protein"	"S	33	34	Protein"	"ropB	112	116	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""covR"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""S"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ropB"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This leads to the conclusion that ropB mutation in 5628 does not represent a similar mechanism to covR / S mutation and may ( a) be an incidental occurrence or ( b) arise secondary to different selection pressures than those associated with the shift to invasive infection.	"ropB	34	38	Protein"	"covR	98	102	Protein"	"S	105	106	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ropB"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""covR"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""S"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The clinical isolate 5628 expressing a truncated RopB, as well as the allelic exchange mutant 5448R - also expressing the truncated RopB from 5628, showed reduced virulence compared to strains containing a full - length RopB.	"RopB	49	53	Protein"	"RopB	132	136	Protein"	"RopB	220	224	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RopB"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RopB"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RopB"", ""start_span"": 220, ""end_span"": 224, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Moreover, these data suggest that SpeB loss, only in the context of mutation of the covR / S regulatory circuit, promotes invasion.	"SpeB	34	38	Protein"	"covR	84	88	Protein"	"S	91	92	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SpeB"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""covR"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""S"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In bacteria post - transcriptional regulation is mediated by relatively few identified RNA - binding protein factors including CsrA, Hfq and SmpB.

A mutation in any one of these three genes, csrA, hfq, and smpB, in Salmonella is attenuated for mouse virulence and unable to survive in macrophages.

While co - immunoprecipiatation has proven valuable in identifying targets of Hfq, and thus targets of translational regulation, one possible criticism of this approach is that the RNA co - immunoprecipitated with Hfq may be brought down simply because Hfq strongly binds to RNA molecules and that the binding is somewhat non - specific.

Deletion of SmpB resulted in a significant decrease in protein expression levels of FliC under LB Log and a significant increase in the protein levels of YciF in AMM - 2.

The result for hfq transcriptional analysis is in general agreement with previous studies for Salmonella [ 10] and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [ 33] where approximately20% and approximately15% of all genes, respectively, were regulated by Hfq, but slightly higher than the number of Hfq - dependent genes reported for E. coli [ 27] and Vibrio cholerae [ 21], approximately6% each.

However, other genes related to anaerobic metabolism and that were previously shown to be important in vivo [ 61 - 63], namely dmsA, aspA and hlyX, were not found in our list of differentially expressed genes.

Numerous phoR, phoB ( the other component of the two - component system) and pts ( the phosphate transport genes genetically and functionally linked to phoBR) mutants were found to be less virulent or avirulent when compared to wild - type strains, with phenotypes such as increased sensitivity to serum, acidity and cationic antimicrobial peptides [ 66] and reduced colonization [ 67].

Three genes satisfied those criteria: two that are coding for outer membrane proteins ( APL _ 0959 and irp), and one coding for a lipoprotein ( APL _ 0920) ( see Additional file 1).

The protein sequence deduced from the gene sequence shares approximately 30% identity with different large sections of the filamentous hemagglitinin / adhesin ( FhaB) from bacteria of the Bordetella genus, which also colonize the respiratory tract of various mammalian hosts.

The three proteins that are encoded by genes fhaB, irp and APL _ 0920 have all these features, and might therefore represent good candidates to include in future cross - serotype vaccines against A. pleuropneumoniae.

Transcriptional profiling of an ssrB mutant To begin to understand regulatory evolution and network expansion of the SsrB response regulator, we profiled the transcriptome of an ssrB mutant and compared it to S.	"ssrB	32	36	Protein"	"SsrB	117	121	Protein"	"ssrB	178	182	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ssrB"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ssrB"", ""start_span"": 178, ""end_span"": 182, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Our ChIP - on - chip data showed discrete SsrB binding at all of these promoters except for the promoter reported to be between ssrA and ssrB [ 25] ( Figure 3).	"SsrB	42	46	Protein"	"ssrA	128	132	Protein"	"ssrB	137	141	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ssrA"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ssrB"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These genes either lacked an upstream ChIP peak above our 3 - standard deviation cut - off ( sseK) or had such a peak but did not reach statistical significance in our transcriptional profiling experiments ( steA, gogB).

The analysis described above recovered SsrB palindrome sequences at the sseA ' and ssaR locations prompting further validation of these sites.

These experiments showed that the sseA ' sequence contributes approximately 75% of transcriptional output at the sseA promoter ( Figure 6C), since deleting the single heptamer in the sseA IGR had little effect on transcriptional output in any of the strain backgrounds.

Mutations in covS are thus expected to affect CovR phosphorylation status differentially in vitro and in vivo ( under stress conditions), and to consequently modulate CovRS signaling - regulation circuits in a complex manner that remains largely unexplored.	"covS	13	17	Protein"	"CovR	46	50	Protein"	"CovRS	167	172	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""covS"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CovR"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CovRS"", ""start_span"": 167, ""end_span"": 172, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Despite the association between covS mutations and the emergence of the hypervirulent phenotype of M1T1 strains, it is unclear whether this increased virulence can be entirely attributed to the modulation of the CovR regulon or if other networks are also perturbed in vivo directly, indirectly, or independently of the CovRS system.

The TrxRS system reportedly responds to a yet - to - be - identified extracellular signal while TrxR itself is directly regulated by CovR [ 42].

Besides metabolic gene sets involved in trehalose and ascorbate utilization, several known virulence factors were downregulated in AP bacteria, and these included the SpeB operon, GRAB, EndoS, and CAMP factor.

Similarly, EndoS, an IgG protease, and CAMP, a hemolysin, are likely needed in blood but with no defined function in subcutaneous or deep tissue.

For example, among the downregulated gene sets are those involved in citrate metabolism, arginine degradation, and de novo pyrimidine synthesis; many of those gene sets were previously reported to be perturbed upon blood inoculation and to be controlled by CovR [ 61] and RopB / Rgg [ 38].

Finally, genes encoding the antiphagocytic M protein, and the toxins streptolysin O and NADGH were among few genes that were upregulated in all conditions except WT - vitro ( Fig. 2, CC7), which suggests that their transcription is dependent on multiple signals, including signals from the host as well as covS - dependent cues.

An occurrence of bac gene, sak188, sak189 TCS genes and erythromycin resistance among S. agalactiae strains A total of 239 S. agalactiae strains isolated from human and animals were studied.

PCR products were cloned into pGEM - T Easy vector ( Promega, USA), and the recombinant plasmids named as pGEM - Tsak188 and pGEM - Tsak189 were digested with EcoRI.

However, SDS - PAGE of the cell lysates revealed that at least one protein band of approximately140 kDa was present in the wild - type strain 168 / 00 and sak188 mutant strain, and was absent in sak189 / sak188 double mutant strain.

4, the mortality rate caused by sak189 / sak188 double mutant strain significantly differed in comparison with that caused by the wild - type and sak188 mutant strains.
