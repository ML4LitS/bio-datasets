We investigated whether PmrB was also required for the pH - dependent induction of pbgP, which was chosen as a prototypical PmrA - activated gene because the PmrA protein binds to the pbgP promoter in vitro ( Wosten and Groisman, 1999) and in vivo ( Shin and Groisman, 2005).

Thus, we determined the beta - galactosidase activity of isogenic pmrB strains harbouring a chromosomal pbgP - lac transcriptional fusion: expression was approximately sixfold lower in a pmrB mutant than in the pmrB + strain following growth at pH 5. 8 ( Fig. 3), indicating that a functional pmrB gene is necessary for a normal response to mild acid pH.

The expression of invF leads to the induction of several effector genes encoded both within SPI1 ( sic / sip operon) and outside SPI1 ( sigD / sopB and sopE), with SicA as a co - factor ( 11).

Using two - hybrid analysis, it has been shown that HilE interacts with HilD, which suggests that HilE represses hilA expression by inhibiting the activity of HilD through a protein - protein interaction ( 19, 20).	"HilE	52	56	Protein"	"HilD	72	76	Protein"	"HilE	98	102	Protein"	"hilA	113	117	Protein"	"HilD	159	163	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""HilE"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""HilD"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""HilE"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilA"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""HilD"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 163, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The expression levels of hilA, invF and hilD, but not of hilC, are decreased in the mlc mutant	"hilA	25	29	Protein"	"invF	31	35	Protein"	"hilD	40	44	Protein"	"hilC	57	61	Protein"	"mlc	84	87	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""hilA"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""invF"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilD"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilC"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mlc"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To identify the target gene in SPI1 that is regulated by Mlc, the expression patterns of the SPI1 - regulatory genes, which include hilA, invF, hilC and hilD, were examined by primer extension analysis of total RNA from SL1344 and SR1304 grown statically to the exponential phase.	"Mlc	57	60	Protein"	"hilA	132	136	Protein"	"invF	138	142	Protein"	"hilC	144	148	Protein"	"hilD	153	157	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mlc"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilA"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""invF"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilC"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilD"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To study the effect of Mlc on hilE expression, we measured the expression of hilE - lacZY on the low - copy plasmid pMAB69, which contains the hilE promoter region from - 886 to + 121, relative to the translation start site.	"Mlc	23	26	Protein"	"hilE	30	34	Protein"	"hilE	77	81	Protein"	"lacZY	84	89	Protein"	"hilE	143	147	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mlc"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilE"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilE"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""lacZY"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilE"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 147, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The role of HilE in the regulation of SPI1 gene expression by Mlc was further studied by comparing the invasive abilities of the hilE and hilE / mlc mutant strains of Salmonella.	"HilE	12	16	Protein"	"Mlc	62	65	Protein"	"hilE	129	133	Protein"	"hilE	138	142	Protein"	"mlc	145	148	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""HilE"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Mlc"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilE"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilE"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mlc"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, the hilE / mlc double mutant showed an almost similar invasion ability to that of the hilE mutant ( Figure 3B), which suggests that the effect of the mlc mutation on the invasive phenotype is mainly dependent upon HilE function.	"hilE	13	17	Protein"	"mlc	20	23	Protein"	"hilE	95	99	Protein"	"mlc	159	162	Protein"	"HilE	223	227	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""hilE"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mlc"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilE"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mlc"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 162, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""HilE"", ""start_span"": 223, ""end_span"": 227, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
While hilD expression was reduced in the mlc mutant, it was slightly higher than the wild - type level in both the hilE and hilE / mlc mutant strains ( Figure 3C).	"hilD	6	10	Protein"	"mlc	41	44	Protein"	"hilE	115	119	Protein"	"hilE	124	128	Protein"	"mlc	131	134	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""hilD"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mlc"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilE"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilE"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mlc"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The low level of hilD expression in the mlc mutant can be explained by the fact that the increased level of HilE in the mlc mutant can repress the activity of HilD, which is known to act as an activator of its own expression ( 9, 36).	"hilD	17	21	Protein"	"mlc	40	43	Protein"	"HilE	108	112	Protein"	"mlc	120	123	Protein"	"HilD	159	163	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""hilD"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mlc"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""HilE"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mlc"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""HilD"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 163, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The 2 - 3 - fold decrease in hilD expression caused by the mlc mutation is sufficient to account for the nearly 10 - fold decrease in hilA and invFA transcription, owing to the nature of the feed - forward regulatory loop, in that moderate effects on HilD production are amplified ( 9).	"hilD	29	33	Protein"	"mlc	59	62	Protein"	"hilA	134	138	Protein"	"invFA	143	148	Protein"	"HilD	251	255	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""hilD"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mlc"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilA"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""invFA"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""HilD"", ""start_span"": 251, ""end_span"": 255, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The two Mlc - binding sites in hilE P3 identified by the gel mobility shift assay and DNase I footprinting analysis show high - level homology with the known consensus Mlc - binding sequences; additionally, the two Mlc - binding sites are separated by 98nt, as is the case for other promoters that have two Mlc - binding sites ( 41).	"Mlc	8	11	Protein"	"hilE	31	35	Protein"	"Mlc	168	171	Protein"	"Mlc	215	218	Protein"	"Mlc	307	310	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mlc"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilE"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Mlc"", ""start_span"": 168, ""end_span"": 171, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Mlc"", ""start_span"": 215, ""end_span"": 218, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Mlc"", ""start_span"": 307, ""end_span"": 310, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, carbon metabolism sensed by PhoB / R may also affect hilE expression ( 22), and this may be one of the reasons for the elevated hilE expression in the presence of carbohydrates in the mlc mutant ( Figure 6A).	"PhoB	34	38	Protein"	"R	41	42	Protein"	"hilE	59	63	Protein"	"hilE	134	138	Protein"	"mlc	190	193	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PhoB"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""R"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilE"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilE"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mlc"", ""start_span"": 190, ""end_span"": 193, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In order to define the role of SalK / SalR in SS2 infection, an isogenic SalK / SalR - deficient mutant was generated and the impact of salKR deletion on virulence of SS2 was assessed.	"SalK	31	35	Protein"	"SalR	38	42	Protein"	"SalK	73	77	Protein"	"SalR	80	84	Protein"	"salKR	136	141	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SalK"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SalR"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SalK"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SalR"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""salKR"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
SsrB regulates the expression of SPI - 2 encoded substrate effectors including ssaB, as well as several integrated virulence effectors such as sseL [ 8] and srfN [ 9] that are encoded elsewhere on the chromosome but that have integrated into the SsrB regulon.

Consistent with the results for SseB, there was a decrease in SifA - 2HA levels in DeltarpoE compared to wild type, although deletion of rpoE did not have an effect on SseL - 2HA.
