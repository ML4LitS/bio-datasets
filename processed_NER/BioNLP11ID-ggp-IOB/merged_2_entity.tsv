Firstly, we constructed a partially diploid H37Ra knock - in strain carrying cosmid RD1 - ppe68 - ko that, in BCG yields the greatest amounts of ESAT - 6 expression and secretion [ 24].	ppe68,90,95,Protein	ESAT - 6,145,153,Protein	"[{""token"": ""ppe68"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	train
However, in comparison to the corresponding MT103 wild - type strain, the SO2 strain showed a strongly reduced ESAT - 6 and CFP - 10 specific T cell response, corresponding to a similar low level as the H37Ra strain ( Figure 3B).

We have previously shown that antigen - specific IFN - gamma production of splenocytes is a reliable readout system to evaluate whether or not ESAT - 6 was secreted by recombinant strains [ 23, 24, 26].

Thus, in order to determine the reason for the observed failure of H37Ra to induce ESAT - 6 - specific responses, H37Rv and H37Ra strains were tested for their potential to express and secrete ESAT - 6 in vitro.

The western blot analysis presented in Figure 5 shows that the cell lysates of H37Ra and H37Ra:: rpsL contain large amounts of ESAT - 6, indicating that the antigen is properly expressed.	rpsL,97,101,Protein	ESAT - 6,127,135,Protein	"[{""token"": ""rpsL"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	train
However, hardly any ESAT - 6 was present in the culture filtrates of these cultures, indicating that these strains were unable to secrete ESAT - 6 under the in vitro conditions employed in spite of proper expression.

In contrast, from examination of the western blots of M. tuberculosis H37Ra:: phoP and H37Rv it is clear that a large portion of their ESAT - 6 protein is secreted into the culture filtrates.	phoP,78,82,Protein	ESAT - 6,135,143,Protein	"[{""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	train
Analysis of the M. tuberculosis MT103 phoP ko strain SO2 showed strong expression of ESAT - 6, but only very little secreted ESAT - 6 ( Figure 5).	ESAT - 6,85,93,Protein	ESAT - 6,125,133,Protein	"[{""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	train
These findings are consistent with data from a previous transcriptional study [ 12] and suggest that the proposed ability of PhoP to downregulate its own expression [ 22] is affected by the S219L phoP mutation [ 29].

They also indicate that it is not a lack of phoP expression that is causing the phoP - associated effects in H37Ra.	phoP,44,48,Protein	phoP,80,84,Protein	"[{""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	train
In the bacterial world the PhoP / PhoR like two - component systems are widely distributed and fulfill a large variety of functions including sensing phosphate and magnesium [ 32, 33], or regulating virulence genes [ 34].

For M. tuberculosis, several studies have described a link between the inactivation of phoP and loss of virulence, suggesting that the phoP gene is required for intracellular growth of M. tuberculosis [ 14, 25].	phoP,87,91,Protein	phoP,135,139,Protein	"[{""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	train
It was also found that the PhoP - PhoR system controls the biosynthesis of polyketide - derived lipids [ 35] and determines the amount of triacylated and monoacylated lipoarabinomannans in M. tuberculosis [ 36].	PhoP,27,31,Protein	PhoR,34,38,Protein	"[{""token"": ""PhoP"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PhoR"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	train
Finally, microarray - based trancriptome analysis using the wild - type versus a phoP ko mutant of H37Rv has provided an overview of the transcriptional regulation linked to PhoP [ 21].	phoP,81,85,Protein	PhoP,174,178,Protein	"[{""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PhoP"", ""start_span"": 174, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	train
This finding argues that the PhoP S219L mutation likely has a broad impact on gene regulation in H37Ra with effects similar to those seen for complete inactivation of phoP.

[ 12] show substantial differences between cultures grown in roller bottles relative to cultures grown in shake flasks, arguing that this gene cluster might be regulated by environmental conditions through the PhoP / PhoR system.

Furthermore, rv3614c - rv3616c were reported to be transiently upregulated in the phagosome and under acidic stress [ 38].	rv3614c,13,20,Protein	rv3616c,23,30,Protein	"[{""token"": ""rv3614c"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""rv3616c"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	train
Our results obtained for ESAT - 6 expression ( Figure 5) and the transcriptome data from Gao and colleagues [ 12] argue against direct downregulation of ESAT - 6 in H37Ra.

By complementation with the wild - type copy of PhoP, we obtained a significant increase in virulence in ex vivo and animal models as well as restoration of ESAT - 6 secretion and the accompanying antigen - specific immunological recognition by sensitized splenocytes or T cell hybridomas.

The link described here between mutation of phoP and consequences on ESAT - 6 secretion, however, appears to be one factor that significantly contributes to attenuation.	phoP,44,48,Protein	ESAT - 6,69,77,Protein	"[{""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	train
Thus, our results once more emphasize the great importance of the ESX - 1 system for tubercle bacilli and provide important new information about the phoP - associated virulence regulation in M. tuberculosis.

It is interesting to note that there is only one bacterium else, the insect colonizing S. glossinidius, whose genome also carries a series of unclustered genes coding for PAS _ 4 / LuxR - like receptors, indicating that this kind of receptors plays a role during insect infection.

Therefore, the potential PAS _ 4 / LuxR - like receptors of P. luminescens, Y. enterocolitica, and S. glossinidius might sense JH or other eukaryotic hormones of the insect to adapt their gene expression to the insect host.

Phenotypic variation and thus the switch between mutualism and pathogenicity in P. luminescens is proposed to be regulated by a Ner - like and a HexA - like regulator that repress primary variant specific genes in the stage of the secondary variant [ 17].

Taken together, these data indicate that P. aeruginosa can sense the presence of Mg2 +, Ca2 + or Mn2 + and that chelation of these same cations by DNA results in induction of the PA3552 - PA3559 LPS modification operon.

This coincides with the localization of a CAP - tolerant subpopulation of bacteria that expresses the PA3552 - PA3559 operon along the surface of mushroom - structured P. aeruginosa biofilms [ 49].

Therefore, it appears that there are multiple environmental signals in the CF lung that can induce the expression the PA3552 - PA3559 operon, which may explain why many P. aeruginosa CF isolates show LPS modifications such as aminoarabinose addition to lipid A [ 78].

To explore the relationship between the putative ATP - dependent biochemical function of Rv2623 and the growth - regulating attribute of Rv2623, we engineered mutations within the L1 ( D15E) and beta4 ( G117A) conserved residues that were predicted, on the basis of the crystal structure, to disrupt ATP recognition ( Figure 7A).

Furthermore, given that the attenuated growth phenotype caused by overexpression of Rv2623 could be abrogated by mutations that interfere with the binding of this protein to its nucleotide substrate, it is likely that the mycobacterial growth - regulatory faculty of Rv2623 is mediated by an ATP - dependent function.

Alternatively, in Photorhabdus luminescens, an AprA homologue, PrtA, has been proposed not to be a virulence factor, but rather to be involved in degrading host tissues following host death in order to promote efficient nutrition and development of its symbiotic nematode host [ 14, 29].

Based on this observation and because EAL domain proteins function in the degradation of c - di - GMP, we hypothesized that the motility defect of DeltayhjH ( Figure 1C) is a result of increased intracellular levels of c - di - GMP.

It is hypothesized that YcgR undergoes a conformational change upon binding to c - di - GMP, and that the YcgR - c - di - GMP complex impairs motility through a protein - protein interaction with the flagellar motor [ 57].

The observations that the DeltayhjH mutant is impaired in swimming but indistinguishable from the wild - type strain in swarming, while in contrast the DeltayfiR strain cannot swarm and is only mildly impaired in swimming, support the notion that c - di - GMP signaling pathways are temporally and / or spatially separated, as recently suggested by others [ 58, 59].

The SSR - 3 region in S. glossinidius is fully conserved in gene synteny and content with that of SPI - 2 [ 31], with the exception of two effector genes missing in SSR - 3 ( sseF and sseG) that are required to localize vacuolar Salmonella to the perinuclear Golgi in host cells [ 38], [ 39].	sseF,175,179,Protein	sseG,184,188,Protein	"[{""token"": ""sseF"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 179, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sseG"", ""start_span"": 184, ""end_span"": 188, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
The SsrB ortholog in S. glossinidius is approximately30% divergent with SsrB at the protein level, initially leading us to think that they might have different binding site preferences.

Salmonella may have retained or evolved SsrB input here to create a positive feedback loop on the regulatory system to rapidly adapt to the host environment during infection, similar to transcriptional surge described for the PhoP response regulator [ 40].

With the structure of SsrB available [ 32] and its recognized sequence now identified, future studies will be able to build a picture of how SsrB interacts with both its target DNA, RNA polymerase and potentially other transcription factors including nucleoid associated proteins in order to direct transcription of its regulon.

Additionally, our results reflect that WT bacteria ' s rapid host - adaptive transcriptional reprogramming was not sufficient for their survival, and they were outnumbered by hypervirulent covS mutants with SpeB - / Sdahigh phenotype, which survived up to 14 days in mice chambers.	covS,189,193,Protein	SpeB,207,211,Protein	"[{""token"": ""covS"", ""start_span"": 189, ""end_span"": 193, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SpeB"", ""start_span"": 207, ""end_span"": 211, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test

One of these preserved factors is the highly potent DNase, Sda1, which destroys neutrophil extracellular traps, NETs [ 36], protecting the bacteria from neutrophil killing, promoting bacterial invasion, and facilitating human plasminogen - mediated bacterial dissemination into normally sterile sites, which results in invasive infections [ 14].

Likewise, some genes are only induced in AP - vivo, including those encoding the toxin / enzyme streptokinase and a RofA / Nra - like transcriptional regulator ( Fig. 2, CC10).

Although CovS is expected to modulate many known CovR - repressed subsystems, certain operons may be differentially modulated or may be influenced by other regulator ( s).

In fact, our in vivo data show that covR itself is downregulated in vivo in both WT and AP strains ( Fig. 2, CC2 and Table S1); however, the SLS operon is upregulated in vivo in WT bacteria, suggesting that its regulation is not solely modulated by CovRS.	covR,36,40,Protein	CovRS,249,254,Protein	"[{""token"": ""covR"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CovRS"", ""start_span"": 249, ""end_span"": 254, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
It is possible that SLS is regulated by the catabolite control protein ( CcpA), which was recently shown to be another key transcriptional regulator of the SLS operon [ 46] and which may override CovR - mediated repression of SLS.

SpeB is a major virulence factor in GAS pathogenesis and its expression is regulated by different systems [ 40], [ 56], [ 57], [ 58], including the CovRS system [ 20], [ 53].

In addition, the downregulation of SpeB, EndoS, and CAMP is in agreement with our previous proteomic results [ 12] as well as other published transcriptional analyses [ 13], [ 27].

On the other hand, genes encoding the fibrinolytic enzyme streptokinase, Ska, a RofA - like transcriptional regulator, several cell division proteins, and some phage proteins were only upregulated when the AP bacteria sensed the in vivo environment ( AP - vivo, Fig. 2, CC10).

"This finding suggests that AP bacteria are somehow "" pre - adapted "" to invasiveness and, consequently, when injected into mice, they do not undergo much virulence - related changes as they already possess a thicker capsule, lack a functional SpeB, are equipped with surface virulence proteins, and secrete ready - to - use toxins, including the potent DNase, Sda1."

It is noteworthy that SpeB expression has a dominant effect, since even if secreted in low amounts by a minor subpopulation, this broad - spectrum protease would still be able to degrade, fully or partially, many GAS virulence proteins, including Sda1, thereby rendering the bacteria vulnerable to different effector mechanisms of the host ' s innate immune system including neutrophil killing [ 14], [ 67], [ 68].

This dominant SpeB effect may explain why WT bacteria parish in vivo even though they partially downregulate SpeB transcription ( Table 3).
