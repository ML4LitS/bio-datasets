PmrD binds to the phosphorylated form of PmrA protecting it from dephosphorylation by PmrB ( Kato and Groisman, 2004).

Here we show that PmrA ' s cognate sensor kinase PmrB is required for responding to external changes in pH through a mechanism that requires a histidine and several glutamic acid residues located in its periplasmic domain, as well as the post - translational activator PmrD protein.

Moreover, a mutant expressing a derivative of the PmrA protein that cannot be phosphorylated due to substitution of the putative phosphorylation residue aspartate 51 by alanine ( Kato and Groisman, 2004) completely failed to promote transcription of PmrA - activated genes in response to pH 5. 8, in a similar fashion to the pmrA strain ( A. Kato and E. A. Groisman, unpubl. results).	"PmrA	50	54	Protein"	"PmrA	250	254	Protein"	"pmrA	325	329	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 250, ""end_span"": 254, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pmrA"", ""start_span"": 325, ""end_span"": 329, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The PhoP - activated PmrD protein favours the phosphorylated state of the PmrA protein ( Fig. 1) ( Kato and Groisman, 2004).

This could be because PmrB is directly involved in sensing extracytoplasmic pH in a way analogous to its sensing of Fe3 + and Al3 + ( Wosten et al., 2000), or because PmrB plays an indirect role in its capacity of main ( if not sole) phosphodonor for PmrA.

In fact, PmrB is required for the activation of PmrA - regulated genes in response to the low Mg2 + signal, which is sensed by the PhoQ protein ( Kato and Groisman, 2004) ( Fig. 1).	"PmrB	9	13	Protein"	"PmrA	48	52	Protein"	"PhoQ	131	135	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PhoQ"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We have established that the sensor kinase PmrB is the primary sensor that activates the PmrA protein when Salmonella experiences mild acid pH, resulting in transcription of PmrA - activated genes ( Fig. 1).

Finally, while a role for the PmrA - dependent LPS modifications in the previously described acid tolerance response is unlikely because survival to acid stress ( pH approximately3) was not reduced in cells deficient in pmrA ( data not shown and Bearson et al., 1998), some of the PmrA - regulated genes to which no function has been ascribed yet could mediate other cellular responses to acid pH.

We found that the two known promoters of hilE were not modulated by Mlc, and we identified a third promoter, designated P3, which was repressed by Mlc.

The gel mobility shift assay and footprinting analysis revealed that Mlc repressed hilE in a direct manner by binding to two distinct sites in the hilE P3 promoter region.

The specific down - regulation of hilD observed in the presence of Mlc regulon - inducible sugars, such as glucose and mannose, could not be detected in the mlc mutant.

HilA plays a crucial role in the expression of genes that encode the SPI1 - T3SS apparatus, the prg and inv / spa operons, by binding upstream of prgH and invF ( 10).

( 20) have found that HilE plays an important regulatory role in the expression of the Salmonella - invasive phenotype by affecting hilA transcription through direct interaction with HilD.

The requirement of hilE for Mlc function was reflected in the levels of hilD transcription.

Using a primer extension assay with the hilE5 primer ( Table 2), the promoter of hilE, which is designated as P3, was newly identified; this promoter initiates 335 nucleotides upstream of the translation start site of hilE ( Figure 4B, lane 1).	"hilE5	40	45	Protein"	"hilE	81	85	Protein"	"hilE	218	222	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""hilE5"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilE"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilE"", ""start_span"": 218, ""end_span"": 222, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The specificity of the Mlc effect was verified by complementation, as the plasmid pKB, which expresses mlc, restored the transcriptional level of hilE in SR1304 almost to that of the wild - type strain ( Figure 4B, lane 4).	"Mlc	23	26	Protein"	"mlc	103	106	Protein"	"hilE	146	150	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mlc"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mlc"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilE"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
A gel mobility shift assay was performed with purified Mlc, to test whether Mlc directly represses the hilE P3 promoter.

Sequestration of Mlc by the unphosphorylated form of glucose permease, enzyme IICBGlc, is known to displace Mlc from its DNA - binding sites, thereby allowing transcription of its target genes ( 25 - 27).

In the wild - type strain, glucose and mannose increased hilE expression 2 - fold and hilE activation reduced hilD expression ( Figure 6).

In the absence of sugars, the mlc mutation increased hilE expression 1. 5 - fold, with a concomitant reduction in hilD expression.

The genetic evidence to date is consistent with a regulatory cascade of transcriptional activation, in which HilD, HilA and InvF act sequentially to activate SPI1 expression.	"HilD	109	113	Protein"	"HilA	115	119	Protein"	"InvF	124	128	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""HilD"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""HilA"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""InvF"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In brief, HilD binds directly to sites upstream of hilA and invFD and acts as an activator ( 14, 16, 36).

HilA activates the transcription of invFA and SPI1 - T3SS apparatus genes required for the secretion of effector proteins, whereas the expression of effector proteins is regulated by InvF ( 10, 11).

This may be partly due to the expression of hilC, a de - repressor of hilA, which was not reduced in the mlc mutant ( Figure 2A).	"hilC	44	48	Protein"	"hilA	70	74	Protein"	"mlc	105	108	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""hilC"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilA"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mlc"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We have reported previously that there may be an independent hilC regulatory pathway that is not applicable to hilA or invFA regulation when bacteria respond to changes in osmolarity ( 29).

Our data clearly demonstrate that Mlc directly regulates hilE expression by binding to the hilE P3 promoter ( Figure 5).

It has been demonstrated that the region 190 - 270 - bp upstream of the hilE promoter is required for the activation of hilE P2 expression by FimYZ, which is a response regulator that is involved in the expression of type 1 fimbriae and motility genes ( 18, Figure 5C).

Glucose and mannose induce the Mlc regulon ( 39) by dephosphorylating EIICBGlc, which then sequesters Mlc from its binding sites ( 27, 43).

The results presented in this study support the notion that hilE expression is activated as a result of Mlc sequestration by unphosphorylated EIICBGlc in the presence of glucose.

We observed a 2 - fold activation of hilE and concomitant repression of hilD in the presence of glucose or mannose, which are known inducers of the Mlc regulon, when TB was used ( Figure 6).

Interestingly, carbohydrate regulation of hilE and hilD expression in the mlc mutant created a different story.

All of the carbohydrates tested in this study, with the exception of glycerol, increased hilD expression by approximately1. 1 - 1. 2 - fold, even though hilE expression in the mlc mutant was increased by approximately30% in the presence of the sugars tested ( Figure 6).

The PhoR sensor kinase phosphorylates PhoB when extracellular Pi levels are low, and the phosphorylated PhoB then binds and activates the promoters in the Pho regulon.

However, even in the absence of PhoR, many carbon sources are known to activate the Pho regulon via CreC, which is a PhoR homolog ( 47).

The experiments of functional complementation with the complemented strain CDeltasalKR showed clearly that the reintroduction of salKR into DeltasalKR restored its high pathogenicity.

Mutants lacking the gene encoding the alternative sigma factor sigmaE ( rpoE) are also highly attenuated for intracellular survival, pointing to a potential connection with the SsrAB regulatory system.

SPI - 2 also has genes, ssrA and ssrB, which code for SsrAB, a two - component regulatory system needed for expression of the T3SS [ 6, 7].	"ssrA	24	28	Protein"	"ssrB	33	37	Protein"	"SsrAB	54	59	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ssrA"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ssrB"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SsrAB"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
By testing six promoters representing four classes of SsrB - regulated promoters ( ( i) two type III secretion structural operons in SPI - 2, ( ii) the effector operon in SPI - 2, ( iii) two effector genes unlinked with SPI - 2, and ( iv) an integrated virulence gene unlinked with SPI - 2) we demonstrate that RpoE elicits an effect on a subset of SsrB - regulated genes.	"SsrB	54	58	Protein"	"RpoE	311	315	Protein"	"SsrB	349	353	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RpoE"", ""start_span"": 311, ""end_span"": 315, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 349, ""end_span"": 353, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This effect was bidirectional depending on the promoter and was downstream of ssrB expression itself, since deletion of rpoE had no effect on SsrB levels in the mutant cells.	"ssrB	78	82	Protein"	"rpoE	120	124	Protein"	"SsrB	142	146	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ssrB"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""rpoE"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In this screen, rpoS deletion resulted in a slight increase in SseB levels ( Figure 1A) indicating a role for RpoS in the repression of SPI - 2.	"rpoS	16	20	Protein"	"SseB	63	67	Protein"	"RpoS	110	114	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""rpoS"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SseB"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RpoS"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Since we were predominantly interested in sigma factors that activate SPI - 2 and which could be linked to the previous observation that rpoE mutants are highly attenuated in vivo we choose to focus on RpoE in the current study, which had the most influence on SseB levels in the cell.	"rpoE	137	141	Protein"	"RpoE	202	206	Protein"	"SseB	261	265	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""rpoE"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RpoE"", ""start_span"": 202, ""end_span"": 206, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SseB"", ""start_span"": 261, ""end_span"": 265, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Typhimurium strain SL1344 and we verified that this in - frame deletion had the same effect on SseB as the rpoE:: cat mutant used previously ( Figure 1B).

To do this we examined the levels of SseL - 2HA, SifA - 2HA and SrfN - 2HA expressed from their endogenous promoters under SPI - 2 inducing conditions ( Figure 1C).	"SseL - 2HA	37	47	Protein"	"SifA - 2HA	49	59	Protein"	"SrfN - 2HA	64	74	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SseL - 2HA"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SifA - 2HA"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SrfN - 2HA"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Relative to its expression in wild type cells, the level of SrfN - 2HA was reproducibly increased in the DeltarpoE cells, suggesting a role for sigmaE in the repression of SrfN, although it is unlikely that this is through a direct mechanism.	"SrfN - 2HA	60	70	Protein"	"DeltarpoE	105	114	Protein"	"SrfN	172	176	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SrfN - 2HA"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""DeltarpoE"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SrfN"", ""start_span"": 172, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Our results indicate that rpoE deletion has no effect on SsrB levels under SPI - 2 inducing conditions suggesting that the sigmaE pathway regulates effector expression downstream of ssrAB transcription.

The cheB2 gene belongs to the P. aeruginosa chemotaxis che2 gene cluster ( cluster II, PA0180 - PA0173) ( Figure 1) [ 21].

In our study we further compare the phenotypes of cheB2 and cheB1 mutants and propose that the cheB2 gene has a specific role during infection, which is essential for pathogenesis.

The first, PA2588, encodes an AraC - type regulatory protein, with 48% similarity to the PAO1 PA0831 gene product, OruR [ 36].

Another mutant had an insertion in PA2585 encoding the UvrABC endonuclease subunit UvrC, required for the excision of damaged DNA.

For example, three group 1A mutants TB0173s ( cheB2, p < 0. 001), TB4554s ( pilY1, p < 0. 001) and TB4380s ( colS, p < 0. 001) each required at least one additional day ( 4 days) in order to reach 50% killing ( data not shown).

Furthermore, the mutants TB0260s ( hypothetical, PA0260) and TB5479s ( gltP - like) had a significant reduction in swimming motility ( Table 1) whereas the mutants TB2588s ( araC - like) and TB3080s ( hypothetical) had a significant reduction in swarming motility ( Table 1).

The 8 PCR products were meant to cover the totality of the che2 cluster ( Figure 1 and Figure S2) starting from the mcpA gene to the PA0171 gene located downstream cheB2 ( PA0173).
