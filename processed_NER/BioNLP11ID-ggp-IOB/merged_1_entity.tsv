We were particularly interested in a C to T mutation responsible for the serine to leucine replacement at position 219, S219L, of the two - component regulator PhoP as this protein is well known for its involvement in the virulent phenotype of M. tuberculosis [ 14].

As in previous DNA / DNA microarray analyses [ 10], and from inspection of the very recently released genome sequence of H37Ra, no significant differences in the ESX - 1 encoding region were found, the assumption that the observed lack of ESAT - 6 secretion in H37Ra may be caused by factors outside of the RD1 region is very plausible.

With its well documented role in virulence and strong T cell antigenicity, ESAT - 6 is one of the most important proteins of M. tuberculosis involved in host pathogen interaction [ 5, 41 - 43].

However, as previously observed in complementation studies of BCG [ 18], the level of virulence displayed by the phoP complemented H37Ra strain was still substantially below that of wild - type H37Rv, arguing that the strong attenuation of the H37Ra strain is likely based on several different genetic lesions, such as the one responsible for the absence of phthiocerol dimycocerosates ( PDIM) [ 29], that were probably introduced into this strain during years of continued culture following the original event of attenuation described by Steenken et al. in 1934 [ 6].	phoP,113,117,Protein	"[{""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	train

Measurement of the binding stoichiometry, which comprised HPLC - based quantification of adenine nucleotides from the boiled supernatant and spectral analysis of heat denatured Rv2623 following reconstitution in 6 M guanidine - HCl, yields 1. 4 + / - 0. 2 nucleotide equivalents / monomer with an overall content of 86 + / - 4% ATP ( 14 + / - 4% ADP).

Phylogenomic analysis places Rv2623 in a Uniprot / TrEMBL family ( Q5YVE7) of 370 tandem - domain USPs, and a 113 - member subfamily ( N631) that consists almost exclusively of actinobacterial representatives ( Text S1).

Continued growth for more than 72 hr, however, resulted in the disaggregation of DeltagacS mutant biofilms as indicated by the presence of large, detached clusters floating in the bulk liquid, and a significantly reduced attached biofilm biomass and biofilm thickness ( Fig. 3, Table 2).

Instead, DeltabfiS biofilms exhibited stage - specific phosphorylation events typically detected in 8 - hr - and 24 - hr - old wild type biofilms: the Ser / Thr phosphoproteome contained 15 out of 23 phosphorylated proteins and 2 out of 21 phosphorylated proteins that are specific for 8 - hr - and 24 - hr - old wild type biofilms, respectively ( see Fig. 1, Suppl.

Infection with the wild type resulted in 50% dead animals ( 5 of 10) by day 5 compared to 10% deaths for the TB0173s cheB2 mutant ( 1 of 10; P = 0. 036, Fisher ' s exact test).	cheB2,117,122,Protein	"[{""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	valid
Surviving mice infected with the cheB2 mutant showed a significantly less troubled body condition from days 3 to 6 post infection ( P < 0. 01, Mann - Whitney rank test) than surviving mice infected with the wild type strain indicating that the former group recovered earlier than the latter ( Figure 4B).	cheB2,33,38,Protein	"[{""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	valid
To further evaluate the change in virulence between the parental TB isolate and the TB0173s cheB2 mutant, mice were sacrificed 2 days after bacterial challenge and the lungs were formalin fixed and paraffin embedded.	cheB2,92,97,Protein	"[{""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	valid

We subsequently purified this protease, termed AprA, to homogeneity from the P. entomophila supernatant by anion exchange chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography ( Figure 1D).

To further test this hypothesis, we used a genetic approach by inactivating the aprA gene.	aprA,80,84,Protein	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Sequence analysis of the locus corresponding to aprA revealed a genetic organization characteristic of this class of Type I - secreted proteases [ 14].	aprA,48,52,Protein	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test

SDS - PAGE protein profiles of culture supernatants clearly demonstrated the absence of the 51 - kDa band, and in vitro protease activity of the aprA mutant confirmed the concomitant absence of secreted protease activity ( Figure 1C, lane 6, and 1F).	aprA,145,149,Protein	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
To analyze the in vivo contribution of AprA to P. entomophila virulence, we performed a survival analysis of Drosophila larvae and adults after oral infection with various P. entomophila derivatives.

Similarly, the aprA mutant showed reduced pathogenicity after oral infection of adult flies ( Figure S1).	aprA,15,19,Protein	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
We next compared persistence of wild - type P. entomophila and the aprA mutant by quantifying the number of bacteria in larvae and adults at different time points after infection.	aprA,67,71,Protein	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Whereas the wild - type P. entomophila titer remained high, aprA bacterial levels decreased significantly with time ( Figure 3A, not shown for larvae).	aprA,60,64,Protein	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Complementation of the aprA mutant with the wild - type apr operon restored protease secretion and activity ( Figure 1C, lane 7, and 1F) and resulted in a complete regain of function with respect to all virulence phenotypes ( Figures 2B and S1).	aprA,23,27,Protein	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
In contrast, no rescue was observed with a plasmid containing the full apr operon but carrying a non - polar mutation in aprA ( Figures 2B and S1).	aprA,121,125,Protein	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test

To investigate the connection between activation of the Imd pathway and the outcome of P. entomophila infection in more detail, we focused our analysis on the adult stage when it is easier to monitor survival.

Since P. entomophila is pathogenic under normal wild - type conditions, it may overcome the immune response by establishing a niche in the gut before the Imd pathway is activated.	Imd,154,157,Protein	"[{""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
We used the evf - deficient derivative because this bacterium triggers a local immune response without persisting in the gut.	evf,12,15,Protein	"[{""token"": ""evf"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
This demonstrates that the protection was indeed due to Imd pathway activation in the gut.	Imd,56,59,Protein	"[{""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Over - expression of Imd in the gut protected against P. entomophila, whereas its activation in the fat body did not ( Figure S2).	Imd,21,24,Protein	"[{""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
However, the previous results did not address whether the Imd pathway induced during the course of a natural P. entomophila infection contributes to fly resistance to P. entomophila.	Imd,58,61,Protein	"[{""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
In these flies, the Imd pathway was not constitutively active in the gut but could be induced upon oral bacterial infection similarly to the wild - type situation ( Figure S3A).	Imd,20,23,Protein	"[{""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
It has also been suggested that proteases homologous to AprA in other bacterial species degrade AMPs in vitro, thereby enabling pathogens to withstand the attack of the host immune system [ 20, 21].

This experiment demonstrates that these AMPs can confer protection against P. entomophila and is in good agreement with a previous study showing that Attacin is the most potent AMP against Gram - negative bacteria [ 22].

Importantly, it also reveals for the first time a major contribution of Diptericin to host defense, which was not previously detected using systemic injection of microbes [ 22].

Local Expression of AMP Genes Plays a Major Role against Food - Borne Infections The use of GFP reporter transgenes in Drosophila has revealed that, in addition to the fat body, AMP genes can be expressed in several barrier epithelia that are in direct contact with microorganisms from the environment [ 7, 23].

To explore the potential implication of AMPs in the Imd immune defense against oral infection by P. entomophila, we compared survival of flies expressing only a single AMP.	Imd,52,55,Protein	"[{""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Previous studies revealed only a modest contribution of Diptericin to resistance against Gram - negative bacteria during systemic infection [ 22].	Diptericin,56,66,Protein	"[{""token"": ""Diptericin"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
In contrast, our data reveal that Diptericin plays an essential role in the defense against Gram - negative bacteria when they are ingested.	Diptericin,34,44,Protein	"[{""token"": ""Diptericin"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
The antibacterial activity of Diptericin may be enhanced in the gut by pH and other factors such as lysozymes [ 24].	Diptericin,30,40,Protein	"[{""token"": ""Diptericin"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
It is also possible that Diptericin could reach high concentration levels in restricted areas of the Drosophila gut such as the proventriculus and thus be more effective against pathogens than in other body compartments.

Altogether, our study reveals that local AMP expression plays an important role in defense against oral pathogens and that entomopathogens such as P. entomophila can counteract this effect by expressing aprA.	aprA,203,207,Protein	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 203, ""end_span"": 207, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
We cannot exclude that AprA degrades other immune effectors or participates directly as a toxic factor by degrading the gut epithelium or the peritrophic matrix.	AprA,23,27,Protein	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
The observation that injection of AprA into the hemocoel is lethal to adult flies supports the hypothesis of additional roles for the protease in bacterial pathogenesis.	AprA,34,38,Protein	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Many pseudomonads and other bacteria express proteases similar to AprA but are not able to infect Drosophila by oral ingestion.	AprA,66,70,Protein	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test

Since gacA mutants did not persist in imd - deficient mutant hosts, we speculate that this persistence - promoting factor provides general protection against gut intestinal conditions rather than a specific protection against the fly immune response.	gacA,6,10,Protein	"[{""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test

The wide functional repertoire of gene products found to affect motility prompted us to examine whether genetic perturbations in these loci affect motility by signaling upstream of the regulatory circuit that controls flagellar biogenesis, resulting in repression of the flhDC flagellar master operon.	flhDC,271,276,Protein	"[{""token"": ""flhDC"", ""start_span"": 271, ""end_span"": 276, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
In addition, we noticed that LPS mutants varied widely in flhDC expression and that the repression of this operon, and the corresponding motility defect, were related to the degree of LPS truncation ( Figure 4).	flhDC,58,63,Protein	"[{""token"": ""flhDC"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Previous evidence links LPS and OPG mutations to the activation of the Rcs phosphorelay system [ 34, 35], and the Rcs system is known to negatively regulate the flhDC operon [ 36].	flhDC,161,166,Protein	"[{""token"": ""flhDC"", ""start_span"": 161, ""end_span"": 166, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test

An flhD mutant was used as a chi - phage - resistant control and, as expected, showed no sensitivity, whereas chi - phage multiplied rapidly in the presence of the wild - type strain ( Figure 5A).	flhD,3,7,Protein	"[{""token"": ""flhD"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Both OPG and LPS mutants showed decreased sensitivity to chi - phage, and the decrease in sensitivity was eliminated by introducing DeltarcsF deletions, indicating that OPG and LPS are not directly required for chi - phage infection ( Figures 5B - D).	DeltarcsF,132,141,Protein	"[{""token"": ""DeltarcsF"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
We found that mutants with OPG defects and severe LPS truncations were incapable of swarming and that introducing DeltarcsF deletions into these mutants was sufficient to rescue the phenotype ( Figures 3F and S6).

Electron microscopy of DeltayhjH mutants showed the appearance of flagella, and light microscopy showed vigorous cellular movement ( unpublished data), indicating that the flagella are capable of rotating; still, this mutant exhibited severe impairment in swimming ( Figure 1C).

Second, while DeltayhjH mutants are impaired in swimming motility, they did not show a measurable defect in swarming ( Figure 6A), which is in agreement with our finding that flagellar motor switching is not critical for swarming.

This is in agreement with a recent study that found that Hfq affects 18% of the Salmonella genome [ 10].	Hfq,57,60,Protein	"[{""token"": ""Hfq"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
We report that Hfq directly or indirectly modulates approximately20% of the Salmonella genome.	Hfq,15,18,Protein	"[{""token"": ""Hfq"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
However this most likely is an underestimate of the true number of proteins that are regulated by Hfq, if accurate protein identifications could be made for the remaining 2829 orfs of the entire Salmonella proteome ( 4450 orfs) that are either expressed at levels too low to be detected or not expressed under the four growth conditions employed in this study.	Hfq,98,101,Protein	"[{""token"": ""Hfq"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Similarly 189 proteins represents approximately4% when compared to all annotated orfs but again this is likely an underestimate of proteins regulated by SmpB if accurate protein identifications could be made for the remaining 2829 orfs that are either expressed at levels too low to be detected or not expressed under the four growth conditions employed in this study.

Craig Venter Institute ( JCVI) functional categories [ 32] showed that Hfq modulated the expression of > / = 40% of the observed proteins in 15 of the 19 functional categories annotated for Salmonella ( Table 1).

Furthermore 51 of the approximately70 Hfq - dependent proteins identified by Sittka et al. were also found to be differentially expressed in the present study.	Hfq,38,41,Protein	"[{""token"": ""Hfq"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test

However under SPI - 1 inducing conditions ( LB Log) regulation of SPI - 1 proteins by Hfq was generally consistent with the literature.	Hfq,86,89,Protein	"[{""token"": ""Hfq"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
However it is worth noting that our observation that Hfq strongly regulates flagellar genes and SPI - 1 TTSS genes, discussed below, is consistent with previous results in Salmonella [ 10], [ 20].

Hfq also appears to play a significant role in central metabolism based on observed differential regulation of numerous proteins involved in glycolysis / gluconeogenesis, the TCA pathway, pyruvate decarboxylation and the pentose phosphate shunt ( see Table S1).	Hfq,0,3,Protein	"[{""token"": ""Hfq"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Examination of the transcript levels of the corresponding genes showed no significant change in mRNA expression levels relative to wildtype, suggesting that Hfq provides most of the control of these pathways for the growth conditions monitored.

Hfq also appears to play a role in the regulation of the translational machinery itself presumably as a feedback mechanism to maintain tight control over the amount of ribosomal synthesis.	Hfq,0,3,Protein	"[{""token"": ""Hfq"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
This suggests that Hfq normally represses translation of these genes under conditions that mimics the intracellular environment ( AMM).	Hfq,19,22,Protein	"[{""token"": ""Hfq"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Collectively, these results point to a central role for Hfq in regulating stress response in Salmonella Typhimurium.	Hfq,56,59,Protein	"[{""token"": ""Hfq"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test

A recent study showed that an Deltahfq mutant that was non - motile exhibited an invasion defect [ 20].	Deltahfq,30,38,Protein	"[{""token"": ""Deltahfq"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Consistent with this previous study, we observed reduced expression of SPI - 1 invasion proteins and numerous motility proteins in the Deltahfq mutant strain primarily in the log phase growth condition compared to the wildtype strain.	Deltahfq,135,143,Protein	"[{""token"": ""Deltahfq"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
This reduction in mRNA expression suggests that Hfq regulates motility and invasion at the transcription level, presumably by modulating one of the upstream regulators.	Hfq,48,51,Protein	"[{""token"": ""Hfq"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Results from our proteomics analysis revealed that Hfq regulates the cob - pdu operon in AMM - 2 ( Figure 4A) and stationary phase ( Figure 4D) growth conditions, with several products of the cob - pdu operon exhibiting increased expression compared to wild type.	Hfq,51,54,Protein	"[{""token"": ""Hfq"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
This was not apparent in the DeltasmpB mutant strain in which cob - pdu protein levels are the same as the parent ( Figure 4A and 4D).	DeltasmpB,29,38,Protein	"[{""token"": ""DeltasmpB"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
The strong regulation of Pdu protein expression by Hfq suggests the pdu operon to be a potential target of sRNA regulation and that correct coordinate expression may be essential for activity.

However, results from our global proteomics analysis indicate that SmpB directly or indirectly modulates the expression of at least 4% of the entire Salmonella Typhimurium proteome determined from ANOVA analysis ( p < 0. 05) ( Table S1).	SmpB,67,71,Protein	"[{""token"": ""SmpB"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
The majority of genes encoding these proteins showed no changes in mRNA level thus it is interesting to speculate an additional role for SmpB as a general post - transcriptional / translational regulator in Salmonella Typhimurium.

P. luminescens produces a signaling molecule AI - 2 to resist reactive oxygen species [ 8] and phenylpropanoid chemical ST to inhibit the activity of antimicrobial enzyme PO and formation of melanotic nodules [ 9], but the strategy used by X. nematophila appears to be that of suppression of transcripts involved in the insect immune response [ 10 - 12].

Gene dacC encoding a peptidoglycan synthesis enzyme D - alanyl - D - alanine carboxypeptidase was induced in X. koppenhoeferi but not in P. temperata, implying that peptidoglycan undergoes structural alterations in X. koppenhoeferi that probably add to its fitness when residing in the host.	dacC,5,9,Protein	"[{""token"": ""dacC"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
As a well - defined virulence factor playing a major role in the development of septicemia [ 22], lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis gene lpsE was induced in X. koppenhoeferi, but not in P. temperata, which may explain in part why relatively slower growing X. koppenhoeferi did not differ from P. temperata in virulence to R. majalis in our previous studies [ 17].	lpsE,135,139,Protein	"[{""token"": ""lpsE"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test

Evaluation of the 7 - 4 - 7 palindrome in the ssaG promoter revealed the minimal architecture and sequence orientation required for transcriptional input.	ssaG,46,50,Protein	"[{""token"": ""ssaG"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Deletion of the entire palindrome resulted in less than 1% activity in wild - type cells, an equivalent level of activity to those lacking ssrB entirely.	ssrB,139,143,Protein	"[{""token"": ""ssrB"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Although palindrome architecture was conserved upstream of SsrB - regulated genes, degenerate palindromes in which one half - site was more conserved were also functional.	SsrB,59,63,Protein	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
As a result of our mutational analyses we conclude that so long as the orientation of a single heptamer of the palindrome is conserved with respect to the downstream gene, SsrB is tolerant of degeneracy in the adjacent spacer and heptamer sequences.

A recent report by Carroll et al, postulated that SsrB first interacts with DNA as a monomer, followed by dimerization [ 32].	SsrB,50,54,Protein	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
The finding that a flexible palindromic sequence can be selective for SsrB input raises many interesting questions around the nature of regulatory evolution.	SsrB,70,74,Protein	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
We showed that the SsrB regulatory palindrome is also present in the orthologous SSR - 3 island of the endosymbiont Sodalis glossinidius and that the palindrome evolved in Sodalis can act as a cis regulatory input function in Salmonella.	SsrB,19,23,Protein	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
To the contrary, high local conservation in the promoters evolved in Salmonella and Sodalis was the crux in defining the functional SsrB input among stochastic noise.	SsrB,132,136,Protein	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Among palindrome - containing promoters, the ssrA promoter is exceptional for two reasons: a lack of conservation between Salmonella and Sodalis, and the evolution of tandem palindromes in Salmonella.	ssrA,45,49,Protein	"[{""token"": ""ssrA"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
One possible interpretation of this divergent regulatory architecture in front of ssrA might relate to bacterial lifestyle.	ssrA,82,86,Protein	"[{""token"": ""ssrA"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
The DNA module that choreographs SsrB - mediated pathogenic behaviour in Salmonella appears to have been conserved for mutualism as well, thereby shedding new light on the significance of cis - regulatory mutations for bacteria evolving in different ecological settings.

Having previously reported that M1T1 Streptococcus pyogenes become hypervirulent in mice due to selection of mutants in the covRS regulatory genes, we set out to dissect the impact of these mutations in vitro and in vivo from the impact of other adaptive events.	covRS,124,129,Protein	"[{""token"": ""covRS"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Using a murine subcutaneous chamber model to sample the bacteria prior to selection or expansion of mutants, we compared gene expression dynamics of wild type ( WT) and previously isolated animal - passaged ( AP) covS mutant bacteria both in vitro and in vivo, and we found extensive transcriptional alterations of pathoadaptive and metabolic gene sets associated with invasion, immune evasion, tissue - dissemination, and metabolic reprogramming.	covS,213,217,Protein	"[{""token"": ""covS"", ""start_span"": 213, ""end_span"": 217, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Our findings demonstrate the engagement of unique regulatory modules in niche adaptation, implicate a critical role for bacterial genetic heterogeneity that surpasses transcriptional in vivo adaptation, and portray the dynamics underlying the selection of hypervirulent covS mutants over their parental WT cells.	covS,270,274,Protein	"[{""token"": ""covS"", ""start_span"": 270, ""end_span"": 274, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Subsequent studies uncovered that this genetic switch is driven by host innate immune pressure that selects for bacteria with pathoadaptive mutations in the covRS genetic locus [ 13], [ 14].	covRS,157,162,Protein	"[{""token"": ""covRS"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 162, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
CovR regulatory activity is thought to be triggered when the protein is phosphorylated at D53 [ 21], possibly by acetyl phosphate [ 22], [ 23].	CovR,0,4,Protein	"[{""token"": ""CovR"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
In accordance with these biochemical findings, we and others have reported that some covS mutations generate hypervirulent isolates associated with invasive forms of streptococcal infection [ 13], [ 14], [ 26], [ 28].	covS,85,89,Protein	"[{""token"": ""covS"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
One of the most striking outcomes of these mutations is the constitutive repression of a gene encoding the key GAS cysteine protease, SpeB, which remodels the host - pathogen interface [ 29] by differentially degrading bacterial surface and secreted proteins [ 12], [ 30], [ 31] as well as host proteins [ 32], [ 33], [ 34].	SpeB,134,138,Protein	"[{""token"": ""SpeB"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Consequently, absence of a proteolytically active SpeB preserves several virulence factors that it normally degrades [ 12], [ 35].	SpeB,50,54,Protein	"[{""token"": ""SpeB"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Additionally, the effects of covS mutations on bacterial niche adaptability are still undetermined because the in vivo transcriptomes of the wild type ( WT) and animal - passaged ( AP) bacteria have not been compared under the same experimental conditions.	covS,29,33,Protein	"[{""token"": ""covS"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
This difference in buoyancy can be attributed to differences in proteolytic activity ( WT > > AP) that may degrade many surface proteins, including pilin, or induce changes in the surface charge making bacterial aggregates more compact.	pilin,148,153,Protein	"[{""token"": ""pilin"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Overall, at the least conservative statistical threshold ( P < 0. 05), the transcription of 557 ( 23. 9%) out of 2, 329 genes probed in the microarrays was significantly perturbed ( up or down, at one or more conditions, Fig. S3) and the only set of contiguous genes that underwent transcriptional changes at all tested conditions is the SpeB operon gene set ( CC4 in Fig. 2).	SpeB,338,342,Protein	"[{""token"": ""SpeB"", ""start_span"": 338, ""end_span"": 342, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
However, the fold - change in SpeB operon transcription level largely varied across the four experimental conditions, ranging from a 2. 2 - fold to a 30 - fold downregulation ( Table 3).	SpeB,30,34,Protein	"[{""token"": ""SpeB"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
For example, in both the SLS operon and the Trx locus, we observed a striking difference between the effects of the covS mutation and the in vivo adaptation ( Fig. 4, CC6).	covS,116,120,Protein	"[{""token"": ""covS"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Data integration reveals genomic subsystems influenced by the covS mutation in vitro and in vivo	covS,62,66,Protein	"[{""token"": ""covS"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Of interest, among the genes of known function, 25% of those whose transcription was modulated as a consequence of the covS mutation are virulence - related and another 25% are related to carbohydrate metabolism pathways, which are connected to virulence in streptococci [ 44], [ 45], [ 46].	covS,119,123,Protein	"[{""token"": ""covS"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Another complex regulatory pattern is exhibited by the genes of the Trx locus, which include a two - component regulatory system, TrxRS.	TrxRS,130,135,Protein	"[{""token"": ""TrxRS"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Most genes within the Trx locus are downregulated in AP GAS relative to WT, but upregulated in the WT bacteria in vivo ( Fig. 2, CC6 and Fig. 3) suggesting the possibility of CovS - dependent in vivo signaling.	CovS,175,179,Protein	"[{""token"": ""CovS"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 179, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
These in vivo - selected bacteria with the AP phenotype could be differentiated from the WT bacteria by mutations that are clustered in the sensor kinase - encoding covS gene in AP bacteria [ 14], [ 27].	covS,165,169,Protein	"[{""token"": ""covS"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 169, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Environmental adaptation vs. covS mutation	covS,29,33,Protein	"[{""token"": ""covS"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
This finding is in agreement with studies showing that the CovRS system is mainly linked to the regulation of virulence factors and virulence - associated pathways [ 19], [ 20], [ 24], [ 26], [ 27], [ 28], [ 52], [ 53], [ 54], [ 55].	CovRS,59,64,Protein	"[{""token"": ""CovRS"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Whereas SpeB expression may be important in the initial stages of skin infections [ 29], [ 35], its downregulation has been associated with an invasive and hypervirulent phenotype [ 13], [ 14], [ 59].	SpeB,8,12,Protein	"[{""token"": ""SpeB"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Interestingly, what this study revealed is that some of the downstream regulatory effects of the covS mutation in AP bacteria are only manifested in vivo.	covS,97,101,Protein	"[{""token"": ""covS"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Both these expression patterns suggest CovS - dependent in vivo signaling via different downstream pathways.	CovS,39,43,Protein	"[{""token"": ""CovS"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Taken together, these results demonstrate how the murine model has allowed us to finely dissect two classes of events affecting GAS sociomicrobiology: those related to reversible transcriptional adaptation and those irreversibly caused by the covS mutation in AP bacteria.	covS,243,247,Protein	"[{""token"": ""covS"", ""start_span"": 243, ""end_span"": 247, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
This has been demonstrated by the larger number of genes affected during in vivo adaptation of both M1T1 variants compared to those affected by the covS mutation ( Table 2).	covS,148,152,Protein	"[{""token"": ""covS"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
( 2) The covS mutation in AP bacteria seems to be preferentially modulating virulence mechanisms, as about 25% of the known genes perturbed by the mutation belong to virulence subsystems ( Fig. 5) and many of the other perturbed genes are indirectly associated with virulence ( e. g., carbohydrate metabolism [ 66] and arginine utilization proteins [ 38]).	covS,9,13,Protein	"[{""token"": ""covS"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Thus, a complete shutdown of proteolytically active SpeB is essential to preserve effective extracellular virulence factors [ 15].	SpeB,52,56,Protein	"[{""token"": ""SpeB"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
However, the CovRS system is a major player, among these regulators, in driving the bacterial adaptation to the host ' s environment and regulating virulence directly or through other downstream regulators [ 20], [ 54].	CovRS,13,18,Protein	"[{""token"": ""CovRS"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
It is thus counterintuitive that bacteria lacking the important environmental sensor, CovS, would prevail in one of the most stressful environments.	CovS,86,90,Protein	"[{""token"": ""CovS"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
This flexible mechanism allows the bacteria to initially hide from the immune system through SpeB - driven camouflaging, i. e. degradation of most of their immunogenic virulence factors [ 2], [ 3].	SpeB,93,97,Protein	"[{""token"": ""SpeB"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
In conclusion, we have established a model that allowed us to resolve two sets of complex transcriptional events: ( i) those occurring in response to the host environment and ( ii) those caused by a mutation in covS sensor kinase.	covS,211,215,Protein	"[{""token"": ""covS"", ""start_span"": 211, ""end_span"": 215, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Inactivation of CovRS was also observed at phenotypic level: the mutant strains became less virulent compared to the parental wild - type strain [ 9].	CovRS,16,21,Protein	"[{""token"": ""CovRS"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Transcriptome analysis revealed the CovRS core - regulon which consisted of 39 genes including genes of the stress response, the genes important for adhesion of S. agalactiae to the host cells and others [ 10].

As result, 53 strains isolated from pregnant women and 5 strains isolated from the cow ' s milk were found to be bac gene positive.	bac,113,116,Protein	"[{""token"": ""bac"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
As result, most of human bac gene positive strains showed resistance or intermediate resistance to Em in the standard diffusion disk test, that is in agreement with previous observations demonstrating an increase in Em resistance in S. agalactiae population [ 30], [ 31].	bac,25,28,Protein	"[{""token"": ""bac"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test

Subsequently, EcoRI fragments were cloned into suicide vector pVA891 - 2, and the recombinant plasmids named as pHK and pRR, respectively, were used to transform S. agalactiae strain 168 / 00 according to the protocol [ 33].

Importantly, 8 out of 9 amino acids, which composed HTH motif presumably involved in DNA - binding according to BLASTp analysis ( http: / / blast. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov / Blast. cgi), were lost in Sak189 protein due to insertional mutagenesis.

Thus, we suggest that beta - antigen located on the bacterial surface can interfere with the disease process and play a role of anti - virulent factor ( at least, in mice) similarly to hyaluronate lyase of S. pyogenes [ 41].	beta - antigen,22,36,Protein	"[{""token"": ""beta - antigen"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
It is also in agreement with results of Kong et al. who demonstrated that presence of shorter variants of beta - antigen is associated with increased virulence [ 32].	beta - antigen,106,120,Protein	"[{""token"": ""beta - antigen"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
