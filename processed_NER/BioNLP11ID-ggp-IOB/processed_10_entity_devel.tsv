In order to confirm the effect of sigmaE on the expression of a broad range of SsrB - regulated virulence genes, we used wild type and DeltarpoE cells and integrated into the chromosome individually six single - copy transcriptional fusions representing promoters for four classes of SsrB - dependent genes or operons ( ( i) type III secretion effector operon ( sseA); ( ii) structural operon I ( ssaB); ( iii) structural operon II ( ssaG); ( iv and v) effectors encoded outside of SPI - 2 ( sseL and sifA); and ( vi) integrated virulence genes unlinked to SPI - 2 ( srfN) [ 9].

In contrast, promoter activity for sseA, ssaB, and sifA decreased in the rpoE mutant compared to wild type cells ( Figure 2A, B and 2D), whereas promoter activity from the ssaG and srfN reporters was upregulated in the rpoE mutant ( Figure 2C and 2F). beta - galactosidase activity observed from the sseL reporter was unaltered in the rpoE deletion compared to that in wild type cells ( Figure 2E).
