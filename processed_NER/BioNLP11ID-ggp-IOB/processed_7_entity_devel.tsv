Mild acid pH induces transcription of PmrA - regulated genes To examine the mild acid pH induction of PmrA - activated genes, we grew Salmonella cells harbouring chromosomal lacZYA transcriptional fusions to the PmrA - regulated genes pbgP, pmrC and ugd ( Wosten and Groisman, 1999) in N - minimal media buffered at pH 5. 8 or 7. 7.

In the animal model, attenuation of virulence has been noted for Salmonella strains that carry mutations in the pts, crr, cya or crp genes, which encode the general energy - coupling enzymes of the PTS, enzyme IIAGlc of the PTS, adenylate cyclase and cyclic AMP receptor protein, respectively ( 23, 24).

The hilC mutation had little effect on SPI1 gene expression or the invasive phenotype, whereas the over - expression of hilC suppressed the hilD mutation, thereby promoting high levels of hilA and invF expression, which suggests that HilC can partially compensate for the loss of function of HilD and the invasive phenotype ( 8, 9, 15).

These results suggested that salK and salR are transcriptionally coupled, and the five downstream ( 05SSU0942 - 05SSU0938) genes are co - transcribed from a promoter positioned immediately upstream of 05SSU0942 and that their transcription ends between the 05SSU0938 - 05SSU0937 intergenic region which contains a terminator - like inverted repeat sequence.

Together with some elements of DNA recombination / repair ( 05SSU0063, 05SSU0588 and 05SSU0953), two transcription regulators ( 05SSU0503 and 05SSU1233) were also under the regulation of SalK / SalR.
