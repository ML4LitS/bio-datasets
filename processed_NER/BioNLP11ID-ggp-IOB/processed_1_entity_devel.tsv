Growth in mild acid ( pH 5. 8) promotes transcription of genes activated by the response regulator PmrA, but the signalling pathway ( s) that mediates this response has thus far remained unexplored.	"PmrA	99	103	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Growth of Salmonella in mild acid ( pH 5. 8) also promotes transcription of genes regulated by the response regulator PmrA ( Soncini and Groisman, 1996).	"PmrA	118	122	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The PmrA - regulated products characterized thus far mediate modifications to the various components of the lipopolysacharide ( LPS) structure including the lipid A ( Gunn et al., 1998; Trent et al., 2001; Zhou et al., 2001; Breazeale et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2004), the core region ( Nishino et al., 2006) and the O - antigen ( Delgado et al., 2006).	"PmrA	4	8	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
While other PmrA - regulated genes have been identified ( Marchal et al., 2004; Tamayo et al., 2005), their biochemical activities and the role ( s) that they play in Salmonella ' s life remain unknown.	"PmrA	12	16	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
A similar induction of pbgP transcription was found when MES was used as the buffering agent in the media at pH 5. 8 instead of Bis - Tris ( data not shown), indicating that the mild acid effect on gene expression was not due to a particular buffering system.	"pbgP	23	27	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""pbgP"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The transcriptional activation of PmrA - regulated genes taking place at pH 5. 8 could be due to trace amounts of metals such as Fe3 +, which is more soluble at acidic pH.	"PmrA	34	38	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Expression of pbgP was still induced when Salmonella was grown in the Chelex - treated medium ( Fig. 2D) or in media containing the specific Fe3 + chelator deferoxamine mesylate ( data not shown) supporting the notion that mild acid pH is responsible for the observed induction.	"pbgP	14	18	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""pbgP"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
From these results we conclude that Salmonella harbours a signalling pathway that responds to mild acid pH by activating the PmrA protein through phosphorylation.	"PmrA	125	129	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We considered the possibility of PmrA being phosphorylated from acetyl phosphate because acetyl phosphate has been shown to serve as phosphoryl donor to several response regulators when their cognate sensors are absent ( see Wolfe, 2005 for a review).	"PmrA	33	37	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We examined transcription of the pmrD gene using RNA isolated from organisms grown at pH 5. 8 or 7. 7.	"pmrD	33	37	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""pmrD"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Growth at pH 5. 8 resulted in pmrD transcript levels that were approximately3. 5 - fold higher than in organisms grown at pH 7. 7 ( Fig. 4A).	"pmrD	30	34	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""pmrD"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Conserved histidine and glutamic acid residues in the periplasmic domain of PmrB are required for signalling in response to mild acid pH	"PmrB	76	80	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, we reasoned that if PmrB senses extracytoplasmic pH directly, its periplasmic domain ( Fig. 5A) was likely to be required for the response to this signal.	"PmrB	26	30	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
There was no pbgP expression in cells grown at pH 5. 8 ( Fig. 5B) or in the presence of Fe3 + ( Fig. 5D), which is in contrast to the normal activation in response to low Mg2 + ( Fig. 5C).	"pbgP	13	17	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""pbgP"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Together, these results argue in favour of the notion that PmrB senses extracellular pH besides its previously described ligands Fe3 + and Al3 + ( Wosten et al., 2000).	"PmrB	59	63	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
An alignment of the amino acid sequences corresponding to the putative periplasmic domain of the PmrB proteins from six enteric species revealed that nine residues are highly conserved ( Fig. 6A).	"PmrB	97	101	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Because the pKa of free histidine is approximately6, the pH at which PmrA - activated genes are induced, we hypothesized that this residue might be required for pH sensing.	"PmrA	69	73	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To test this hypothesis, we constructed a plasmid that produced a PmrB protein containing a single histidine to alanine substitution at position 35.	"PmrB	66	70	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
While this mutation severely diminished the ability of Salmonella to respond to mild acid pH, there still was some residual pbgP expression ( Fig. 6B) suggesting that other residues might also be required for pH sensing.	"pbgP	124	128	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""pbgP"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Four of the nine conserved amino acids in the periplasmic domain of PmrB are glutamic acid residues, which also could be subjected to changes in protonation upon variations in the pH of their surroundings.	"PmrB	68	72	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Although the pKa of free glutamic acid is approximately4, which is well below the range of pH at which PmrA - activated genes are induced, the folding of a protein can dramatically change the pKa of its residues.	"PmrA	103	107	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
For instance, the pKa of one of the glutamic acid residues of the regulatory protein TraM is approximately7. 7 ( Lu et al., 2006).	"TraM	85	89	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TraM"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To test this hypothesis, we used plasmids that produced PmrB proteins containing single - amino - acid replacements in the conserved glutamic acid residues.	"PmrB	56	60	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
What role could the mild acid pH - dependent activation of PmrA - regulated genes play in Salmonella ' s lifestyle?	"PmrA	59	63	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The periplasmic histidine and glutamates are conserved in the PmrB periplasmic domain of other enteric species, raising the possibility that the signalling pathway described in this article may be operating in other organisms in addition to S. enterica.	"PmrB	62	66	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
For example, the eukaryotic G - protein coupled receptor OGR1 is inactive at pH 7. 8 and fully active at pH 6. 8 suggesting that the pH sensing mechanism involves protonation of several extracytoplasmic histidines ( Ludwig et al., 2003), which is in agreement with the pKa of free histidine of approximately6.	"OGR1	57	61	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""OGR1"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In the case of PmrB, a normal response to mild acid pH requires not only a periplasmic histidine but also several glutamic acid residues.	"PmrB	15	19	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, regulation of PmrB activity may involve protonation of one or more of these amino acids.	"PmrB	25	29	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Indeed, the pKa of one of the glutamic acid residues of the regulatory protein TraM is approximately7. 7 in the folded protein ( Lu et al., 2006).	"TraM	79	83	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TraM"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, it is plausible that protonation / deprotonation of one or more of the glutamic acids in the periplasmic domain of PmrB could occur at pH approximately5. 8.	"PmrB	126	130	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Integral membrane proteins that recognize signals in addition to extracytoplasmic pH, such as PmrB, have been identified both in prokaryotes and in eukaryotes.	"PmrB	94	98	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The CadC protein of E. coli, for example, is activated by exogenous lysine besides acid pH ( Dell et al., 1994).	"CadC	4	8	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CadC"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Likewise, the human receptor OGR1 responds to both pH and sphingosylphosphorylcholine ( Ludwig et al., 2003).	"OGR1	29	33	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""OGR1"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The fact that the PmrB H35A and the E64A mutant proteins displayed partial activity in response to ferric iron but were severely impaired in their ability to respond to acid pH ( compare Fig. 6B and D) supports the notion that these signals are sensed independently.	"PmrB	18	22	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Similarly, cadC mutants have been isolated that are impaired in the ability to sense only one of its two inducing signals ( Dell et al., 1994).	"cadC	11	15	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cadC"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore, the ability to sense two different compounds has also recently been shown to be genetically distinguishable in the bacterial chemoreceptor Tcp ( Iwama et al., 2006).	"Tcp	152	155	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Tcp"", ""start_span"": 152, ""end_span"": 155, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Consistent with its role in acid pH activation, expression of the pmrD gene was promoted in media of mild acid pH ( Fig. 4).	"pmrD	66	70	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""pmrD"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The mechanism ( s) by which acid pH leads to an increase in the levels of the pmrD transcript, however, remains unclear.	"pmrD	78	82	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""pmrD"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
What role could the pH - dependent activation of PmrA - regulated genes play in Salmonella ' s lifestyle?	"PmrA	49	53	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Because several PmrA - activated gene products are responsible for remodelling the LPS structure and these modifications are required for resistance to certain antimicrobial peptides and toxic metals, one possibility is that acidic environments provide a means to induce the cell envelope changes resulting in resistance.	"PmrA	16	20	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The global regulator Mlc is a repressor of several genes and operons that are involved in sugar uptake and metabolism.	"Mlc	21	24	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mlc"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Mlc is a global regulator of carbohydrate metabolism and controls several genes involved in sugar utilization ( 25 - 27).	"Mlc	0	3	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mlc"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, it seemed possible that Mlc also affects the virulence of Salmonella.	"Mlc	35	38	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mlc"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Mutation of the mlc gene reduces Salmonella invasiveness The process of invasion into non - phagocytic epithelial cells, which is known to be mediated by proteins secreted by the SPI1 - encoded type III machinery ( 3), is an important initial step in the pathogenesis of S.	"mlc	16	19	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""mlc"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We examined the ability of an mlc mutant, SR1304, to invade cultured HEp - 2 and HeLa epithelial cells.	"mlc	30	33	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""mlc"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To discover whether the mlc mutant grown under the SPI1 - inducing condition affects the capacity to induce apoptosis in macrophages, the release of the cytoplasmic enzyme LDH was determined in a cytotoxicity assay ( 33).	"mlc	24	27	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""mlc"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Figure 1C shows that SL1344 killed 42% of the macrophages, whereas SR1304 killed only 16% of the macrophages 4h after infection, which demonstrates that the mlc gene plays an important role in the expression of genes involved in cytotoxicity.	"mlc	157	160	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""mlc"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 160, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We also tested the effect of the mlc mutation on the ability to replicate within the RAW264. 7 macrophage cell line.	"mlc	33	36	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""mlc"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Collectively, these results suggest that the main target of Mlc action in Salmonella virulence is SPI1, which is known to encode various genes that are required for Salmonella invasion of host cells.

However, hilC expression was unchanged ( Figure 2A).	"hilC	9	13	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""hilC"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Baxter and Jones ( 18) have identified two independent hilE promoters, P1 and P2.	"hilE	55	59	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""hilE"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We performed a primer extension assay of total RNA isolated from SL1344 grown to exponential phase in static culture, using the primer described by Baxter and Jones ( 18), to discover which promoter is regulated by Mlc.	"Mlc	215	218	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mlc"", ""start_span"": 215, ""end_span"": 218, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This difference could be attributed to differences in the experimental model conditions; in our study, total RNA from a Salmonella strain was used in the primer extension assay, whereas Baxter and Jones ( 18) used total RNA prepared from E. coli harboring the hilE reporter plasmid pMAB69.	"hilE	260	264	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""hilE"", ""start_span"": 260, ""end_span"": 264, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, the activities of the two promoters were not changed by mlc mutation.	"mlc	65	68	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""mlc"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We observed putative - 10 ( TTAAAT) and - 35 ( ATAACA) motifs for hilE P3 ( Figure 4C) ( 37).	"hilE	66	70	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""hilE"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Transcription from the P3 promoter was increased substantially by mlc mutation ( Figure 4B, lane 2).	"mlc	66	69	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""mlc"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The Mlc - His6 protein was produced in E. coli and purified to > 90% homogeneity by Ni2 + affinity chromatography.	"Mlc	4	7	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mlc"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Inspection of the DNA sequences at these sites showed high - level homology with the known consensus Mlc - binding sequence, which has the conserved TT - 9bp - AA motif and an AT - rich region at positions + / - 7 to + / - 11, showing imperfect dyad symmetry ( 38) ( Figure 5C).	"Mlc	101	104	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mlc"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The Mlc regulon can be induced by glucose and, to a lesser extent, by mannose ( 39).	"Mlc	4	7	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mlc"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Interestingly, arabinose also activated hilE, albeit to a lesser degree than either glucose or mannose.	"hilE	40	44	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""hilE"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Nevertheless, this caused a minute increase in hilD expression.	"hilD	47	51	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""hilD"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that additional cis - or trans - acting regulatory elements, which have not yet been characterized, are involved in hilE expression.	"hilE	162	166	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""hilE"", ""start_span"": 162, ""end_span"": 166, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In addition, hilE expression was also increased in the presence of arabinose, which suggests an additional regulatory mechanism mediated by arabinose.	"hilE	13	17	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""hilE"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These results suggest that the presence of complex regulatory mechanisms for hilE is required for optimal regulation of the SPI1 genes, as can be expected from the complex regulatory networks identified in Salmonella ( 46).

The results of bioinformatics analysis indicated that the response regulator, SalR, contains 199 amino acids ( aa) with the three N - terminal invariant aa residues ( D30, D54 and K107) of the receiver domain of response regulators from Gram - positive bacteria [ 25].

Together with the wild type strain, DeltasalKR was subjected to PMN - mediated killing assays.	"DeltasalKR	36	46	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltasalKR"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We found that the mortality rate of both strains ( WT and DeltasalKR) increased coordinately with the extension of the co - culture time with PMN cells ( Fig. 6).	"DeltasalKR	58	68	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltasalKR"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Genes involved in substance transport and metabolism In the DeltasalKR mutant, transcripts of several ABC - transporters are less abundant.	"DeltasalKR	60	70	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltasalKR"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Although these genes were found to be down - regulated in the mutant, it is not understood how they are associated with the attenuation of DeltasalKR.	"DeltasalKR	139	149	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltasalKR"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Moreover, it should be noted that numerous proteins of unknown function are also depressed in DeltasalKR, which may in part lead to the virulence loss of the mutant via some thus - far - unknown mechanisms.

Remarkably, no gene was found to be up - regulated ( more than twice) in DeltasalKR.	"DeltasalKR	73	83	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltasalKR"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As shown in Table S1, the quantitative results of RT - PCR were highly compatible to the microarray data, in the DeltasalKR mutant, 41 out of 42 selected genes ( 97. 6%) were confirmed to have similar transcript levels using these two different techniques, thus independently confirming the microarray results.

Among the 26 down - regulated genes in the DeltasalKR mutant, five did not recover to expression level of the wild - type strain, indicating that the complemented strain does not imitate completely the exact tuning of gene expression as in the wild - type strain.

Moreover, PCR analysis using primers amplifying the salKR locus also demonstrated that this TCSTS is specific to Chinese epidemic outbreak strains of SS2 ( data not shown), implying its tight linkage to the virulence of this new emerging pathogenic species.

In wild type cells, promoter activity from all the transcriptional fusions was high, as expected, because LPM medium is highly inducing for SsrB activity [ 21].	"SsrB	140	144	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Although the effect of rpoE deletion on promoter activity in some cases was mild, we have previously shown that gene regulators providing only modest transcriptional input have a profound influence on bacterial fitness in a host animal [ 25].	"rpoE	23	27	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""rpoE"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We predict that RpoE confers a similar fine - tuning effect on Salmonella virulence gene expression that is required for optimal within - host fitness during infection.	"RpoE	16	20	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RpoE"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Due to the high degree of conservation in sigma factor binding sequences, sigmaE may not be directly regulating SsrB - dependent promoters.	"SsrB	112	116	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This mechanism would activate a restorative sigmaE pathway, which is consistent with the enhanced susceptibility of rpoE mutants to oxidative stress and antimicrobial peptides [ 13, 15, 16], both of which perturb membrane integrity in vivo.	"rpoE	116	120	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""rpoE"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Unlinking ssrAB transcription from the sigmaE regulon would be advantageous to the cell to prevent commitment to a virulence gene expression program in response to envelope stress not associated with infection.	"ssrAB	10	15	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ssrAB"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Although when considered individually, each promoter was modestly affected by deletion of rpoE, the cumulative effects of mild rewired inputs on multiple virulence promoters has been shown to severely compromise in - host fitness and virulence ability [ 25].

Based on these and other data [ 4, 12 - 15], the genetic interaction between sigmaE and a subset of SsrB - regulated genes may serve to coordinate the spatial and temporal activation of virulence genes in a host setting, likely in response to membrane damage resulting from oxidative anti - microbial systems and membrane - targeted host defence peptides.

We chose to further characterize the TB0173s mutant ( cheB2), as this isolate was affected in all phenotypes tested and thus exhibited a general motility and virulence defect ( Table 1).	"cheB2	54	59	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To ensure that the cheB2 gene in the TB strain is located in a cluster similar to the che2 cluster described for the PAO1 or PA14 strains, we further analyzed the corresponding TB chromosomal region.	"cheB2	19	24	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Both cheB2 mutants, TB0173s and TB0173i, required at least one additional day, as compared to TB, to kill 50% of exposed nematodes.	"cheB2	5	10	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In addition, we engineered a similar cheB2 mutation in the P. aeruginosa PA14 strain, yielding PA140173i ( see Materials and Methods), and observed similar virulence attenuation on C. elegans ( Figure S3).	"cheB2	37	42	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This further confirmed the virulence phenotype of a cheB2 mutant and indicated that it is not a TB strain - specific trait.	"cheB2	52	57	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

We investigated whether the loss of virulence observed in the cheB2 mutant on C. elegans is specific, and results from a loss of chemotaxis under the direction of the che2 chemotactic cluster, rather than being linked with more global chemotactic or motility deficiency.	"cheB2	62	67	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We thus investigated the fate of a cheB1 mutant in a similar assay.	"cheB1	35	40	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cheB1"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Interestingly, the cheB1 mutant showed no significant reduction in C. elegans killing when compared to the parental TB strain, with only 36% of the worms alive after 4 days post infection.	"cheB1	19	24	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cheB1"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The mobility of the cheB1 mutant was also analyzed and both swimming and swarming motility appeared to be affected as shown in Figure 2.	"cheB1	20	25	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cheB1"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The parental TB strain was able to move towards the attractant ( an increase of slightly more than half a log of bacteria over 45 min) and the TB0173s strain ( cheB2 mutant) was also capable of chemotaxis, even though much reduced as compared to TB ( Figure S4).

However, the TB1459i strain ( cheB1 mutant) was no longer able to move towards the attractant, and thus showed a defect in this chemotaxis assay ( Figure S4).	"cheB1	30	35	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cheB1"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Infection with the wild type resulted in 50% dead animals ( 5 of 10) by day 5 compared to 10% deaths for the TB0173s cheB2 mutant ( 1 of 10; P = 0. 036, Fisher ' s exact test).	"cheB2	117	122	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Surviving mice infected with the cheB2 mutant showed a significantly less troubled body condition from days 3 to 6 post infection ( P < 0. 01, Mann - Whitney rank test) than surviving mice infected with the wild type strain indicating that the former group recovered earlier than the latter ( Figure 4B).	"cheB2	33	38	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To further evaluate the change in virulence between the parental TB isolate and the TB0173s cheB2 mutant, mice were sacrificed 2 days after bacterial challenge and the lungs were formalin fixed and paraffin embedded.

In contrast, the TB0173s cheB2 mutant had caused markedly reduced inflammation and very little PMN infiltration ( Figure 5B).	"cheB2	25	30	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It is worth noting that a mutant affected in the gacA gene, previously identified in the slow killing assay, appeared to be attenuated in our liquid - based killing assay.	"gacA	49	53	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

The cheB2 mutant was also found to have reduced adhesive capabilities to bronchial epithelial cells ( Figure S1).	"cheB2	4	9	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Most importantly in a mouse lung model of infection, the cheB2 mutant was highly attenuated and failed to induce strong inflammatory response in the infected mice lungs.	"cheB2	57	62	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The cheB1 mutant virulence is not attenuated in the slow killing assay.	"cheB1	4	9	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cheB1"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

These observations suggest that the attenuation in virulence of the cheB2 mutant is specific and not due to a global effect on motility or chemotaxis.	"cheB2	68	73	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
