Here we report that this activation requires both PmrA ' s cognate sensor kinase PmrB, which had been previously shown to respond to Fe3 + and Al3 +, and PmrA ' s post - translational activator PmrD.

The PmrB protein is necessary for activation of the PmrA protein in low Mg2 + ( Kox et al., 2000; Kato and Groisman, 2004) and in the presence of Fe3 + ( Wosten et al., 2000), consistent with the notion that PmrB is the major phosphodonor for PmrA.

There was residual pbgP expression in the pmrB mutant induced with mild acid pH ( Fig. 3), which was in contrast to the absence of pbgP transcription in the pmrA mutant ( Fig. 2).	"pbgP	19	23	Protein"	"pmrB	42	46	Protein"	"pbgP	131	135	Protein"	"pmrA	157	161	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""pbgP"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pmrB"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pbgP"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pmrA"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Consistent with this notion, pbgP transcription was abrogated in the pmrB mutant upon deletion of the pta and ackA genes ( Fig. 3), which encode the two enzymes that are required for the production of acetyl phosphate ( Wolfe, 2005) ( Fig. 1).	"pbgP	29	33	Protein"	"pmrB	69	73	Protein"	"pta	102	105	Protein"	"ackA	110	114	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""pbgP"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pmrB"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pta"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ackA"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In contrast, a strain lacking the ability to synthesize acetyl phosphate but with a functional pmrB gene exhibited wild - type pbgP expression levels ( Fig. 3), implying that under normal conditions ( i. e. when a functional pmrB gene is present) acetyl phosphate does not contribute to PmrA phosphorylation.	"pmrB	95	99	Protein"	"pbgP	127	131	Protein"	"pmrB	225	229	Protein"	"PmrA	287	291	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""pmrB"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pbgP"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pmrB"", ""start_span"": 225, ""end_span"": 229, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 287, ""end_span"": 291, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, we tested the possibility of PmrD participating in the PmrA - dependent response to acidic conditions, and thus contributing to the pbgP transcription remaining in a pmrB mutant.	"PmrD	35	39	Protein"	"PmrA	61	65	Protein"	"pbgP	138	142	Protein"	"pmrB	172	176	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrD"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pbgP"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pmrB"", ""start_span"": 172, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Expression of the pbgP gene was abolished in a pmrB pmrD double mutant ( Fig. 3) indicating that both genes are necessary to activate PmrA under acidic conditions.	"pbgP	18	22	Protein"	"pmrB	47	51	Protein"	"pmrD	52	56	Protein"	"PmrA	134	138	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""pbgP"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pmrB"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pmrD"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In contrast to the phenotype of the pta ackA double mutant, pbgP transcription was reduced in the pmrD mutant ( Fig. 3).

The acid - promoted expression of the PmrD protein was phoPQ - dependent, which is in agreement with the fact that PhoP is the only known direct transcriptional activator of pmrD ( Kox et al., 2000).	"PmrD	38	42	Protein"	"phoPQ	55	60	Protein"	"PhoP	115	119	Protein"	"pmrD	174	178	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrD"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""phoPQ"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PhoP"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pmrD"", ""start_span"": 174, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To examine this hypothesis, we tested a Salmonella strain with a chromosomal pbgP - lac fusion, deleted for the chromosomal copy of the pmrB gene and harbouring a plasmid expressing a PmrB protein lacking its periplasmic domain for its ability to promote pbgP expression in response to different signals.	"pbgP	77	81	Protein"	"pmrB	136	140	Protein"	"PmrB	184	188	Protein"	"pbgP	255	259	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""pbgP"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pmrB"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 184, ""end_span"": 188, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pbgP"", ""start_span"": 255, ""end_span"": 259, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Strains expressing the mutant PmrB proteins could express pbgP normally in response to the low Mg2 + signal ( Fig. 6C) ( Wosten et al., 2000), indicating that mutations in residues of the periplasmic domain of PmrB do not impair the enzymatic activity of the cytoplasmic domain of the PmrB protein.	"PmrB	30	34	Protein"	"pbgP	58	62	Protein"	"PmrB	210	214	Protein"	"PmrB	285	289	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pbgP"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 210, ""end_span"": 214, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 285, ""end_span"": 289, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The PmrB protein plays the primary role in the pH - dependent activation of PmrA, but full activation also requires PmrD, the post - translational activator of the PmrA protein ( Fig. 3).	"PmrB	4	8	Protein"	"PmrA	76	80	Protein"	"PmrD	116	120	Protein"	"PmrA	164	168	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PmrD"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 168, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The levels of phosphorylated PmrA are determined by the balance of the autokinase + phosphotransferase activity of PmrB and PmrB ' s phosphatase activity towards phospho - PmrA.	"PmrA	29	33	Protein"	"PmrB	115	119	Protein"	"PmrB	124	128	Protein"	"PmrA	172	176	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 172, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Although it has been suggested that the Salmonella PhoQ protein senses acid pH ( Aranda et al., 1992) or responds to both pH and Mg2 + ( Bearson et al., 1998), a direct role for PhoQ in responding to acid pH appears unlikely because not all PhoP - regulated genes are activated under these conditions, which is in contrast to low Mg2 + activating the whole PhoP regulon ( see Groisman and Mouslim, 2006 for a review).	"PhoQ	51	55	Protein"	"PhoQ	178	182	Protein"	"PhoP	241	245	Protein"	"PhoP	357	361	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PhoQ"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PhoQ"", ""start_span"": 178, ""end_span"": 182, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PhoP"", ""start_span"": 241, ""end_span"": 245, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PhoP"", ""start_span"": 357, ""end_span"": 361, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
A Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium mlc mutant showed reduced levels of invasion and cytotoxicity compared to the wild - type, and exhibited reduced expression levels of hilD, hilA and invF, which are regulatory genes in the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI1).	"mlc	42	45	Protein"	"hilD	176	180	Protein"	"hilA	182	186	Protein"	"invF	191	195	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""mlc"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilD"", ""start_span"": 176, ""end_span"": 180, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilA"", ""start_span"": 182, ""end_span"": 186, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""invF"", ""start_span"": 191, ""end_span"": 195, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Although many factors and a complex mechanism related to environmental stimuli are involved in the modulation of SPI1 genes, they are thought to converge on the activation of several transcriptional regulators encoded within SPI1, such as HilA, HilC, HilD and InvF ( 7 - 9).	"HilA	239	243	Protein"	"HilC	245	249	Protein"	"HilD	251	255	Protein"	"InvF	260	264	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""HilA"", ""start_span"": 239, ""end_span"": 243, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""HilC"", ""start_span"": 245, ""end_span"": 249, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""HilD"", ""start_span"": 251, ""end_span"": 255, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""InvF"", ""start_span"": 260, ""end_span"": 264, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
HilC and HilD also directly activate the alternative promoter of the invF operon, which is independent of HilA ( 15, 16).	"HilC	0	4	Protein"	"HilD	9	13	Protein"	"invF	69	73	Protein"	"HilA	106	110	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""HilC"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""HilD"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""invF"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""HilA"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Similar to HilC and HilD, RtsA activates the expression of SPI1 genes by binding upstream of the master regulatory gene, hilA, to induce its expression ( 9, 17).

We also observed reduced expression of the prgH and sigD genes, which are known to be regulated by HilA and InvF ( 10, 11, 29, 35), in SR1304 ( Figure 2B).

When these cells were grown in static cultures to exponential phase, SL1344 - pMAB69 expressed 28. 9 + / - 3. 5 Miller units of beta - galactosidase, whereas SR1304 - pMAB69 expressed 49. 5 + / - 5. 3 Miller units of beta - galactosidase; the level of hilE expression in the mlc mutant was almost 1. 8 - fold higher than that in the wild - type strain.

Two Mlc - binding sites, one at position - 10 to + 12 ( Mlc 1) and the other at position - 86 to - 108 ( Mlc 2) with respect to the transcriptional start site of hilE P3, were identified ( Figure 5B).

The effects of various carbon sources on the expression of hilE and hilD were studied with two Mlc regulon - inducing sugars, glucose and mannose, and two Mlc regulon - non - inducing carbohydrates, arabinose and glycerol.

SL1344 and SR1304 carrying either pMAB69 ( hilE - lacZY) or pJB5 ( hilD - lacZY) were cultivated in TB that was buffered to pH 7. 0 with 0. 1M MOPS, to minimize pH effects arising from growth in the presence of the various carbon sources.

This regulatory cascade implies that the reduced invasive phenotype of mlc mutant is the result of hilD repression, which affects both hilA and invF expression ( Figures 1 and 2).

The HilC / D - dependent transcriptional start site of the invFD promoter is 631bp upstream of the invF open reading frame ( 16).

It has been suggested that the two - component regulatory system PhoR - PhoB leads to increased hilE P2 expression and subsequent repression of hilA and invasion genes ( 7, 18).

The relatively high glucose concentration in the proximal small intestine may repress SPI1 gene expression through Mlc, perhaps together with PhoR - PhoB and / or SirA, whereas upon transit to the distal ileum, the glucose concentration becomes low enough to activate the invasion genes of SPI1.

05SSU0944 and 05SSU0943 were accordingly renamed salK and salR ( Fig. 1).

To test the role of SalK / SalR in the pathogenesis of SS2, we constructed a homologous suicide plasmid, pUC:: salKR with a SpcR cassette ( Fig. 3A), and electrotransformed the competent cells of 05ZYH33.

In a single cross - over mutant which was set as the reference, both the SpcR and pUC18 probe hybridized with a 6. 1 kb Cla I restriction fragment ( Fig. 3B and 3D, lane 3), and the salKR probe hybridized with a 4. 0 kb fragment ( Fig. 3C, lane 3), indicating that this strain had pUC:: salKR integrated into its chromosome by a single cross - over event at the 3 ' - flanking region of the salKR genes ( Fig. 3A, III).

RT - PCR experiments later also showed that neither salK nor salR could be transcribed in DeltasalKR ( data not shown), which further confirmed that salKR had been deleted from the bacterial chromosome.

Both rpoE and rpoN deletions resulted in decreased SseB levels with a more pronounced effect in the rpoE deletion.

A low - copy plasmid containing full - length rpoE and the three endogenous promoters that can drive its expression [ 20] was able to restore wild type levels of SseB to DeltarpoE cells ( Figure 1B) demonstrating that the results were specific to the rpoE deletion.

The variable effects of rpoE deletion on SsrB - regulated effectors suggested that RpoE might direct transcription downstream of ssrB expression.

To test this, we replaced the ssrB gene in DeltarpoE and wild type cells with an ssrB:: FLAG allele [ 19] and examined the levels of SsrB protein in the strains by western blot.	"ssrB	30	34	Protein"	"DeltarpoE	43	52	Protein"	"ssrB	81	85	Protein"	"SsrB	133	137	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ssrB"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""DeltarpoE"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ssrB"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
There was no change in the levels of SsrB - FLAG between wild type and DeltarpoE cells ( Figure 3), indicating that the effects of RpoE on the four classes of virulence gene promoters examined here was not mediated through changes to SsrB protein levels.

Although a bioinformatics screen identified sigmaE consensus sequences upstream of the SPI - 2 genes ssaU, ssaJ, sscA and ssaC [ 26], these genes were not tested for sigmaE - dependence in the present study because the identified consensus sites are in coding sequence within operons, and as a result may not be directly relevant.

Although there is no evidence that sigmaE can directly repress transcription, the negative effect on two promoters observed here might be due to an intermediate RpoE - regulated repressor or compensatory effect where loss of rpoE increases the relative abundance of another sigma factor that can directly activate the ssaG and srfN promoters.

The wsp genes contained in cluster III ( PA3708 - PA3702) have been proposed to contribute to bacterial biofilm formation [ 25], whereas the cluster IV ( Pil - Chp system, PA0408 - PA0417) has been shown to be involved in twitching motility [ 26], [ 27].

Finally, 4 interrupted genes, PA0946, PA3080, PA0260 and PA2769, encode proteins of unknown function.
