Only two clusters ( spy0127 - 0130 and spy1701 - 1704) could have been identified without neighbor clustering; however, a number of these genes were initially annotated as hypothetical proteins, so a potential relationship between the gene members may not have been readily apparent.	"spy0127	20	27	Protein"	"0130	30	34	Protein"	"spy1701	39	46	Protein"	"1704	49	53	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""spy0127"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""0130"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""spy1701"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""1704"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The upregulated spy0127 - 0130 cluster is part of a larger genomic region known as FCT ( for fibronectin - and collagen - binding proteins and T antigen - encoding loci), which spans spy0123 - 0136 in the SF370 genome and encodes surface proteins and transcriptional regulators [ 46].	"spy0127	16	23	Protein"	"0130	26	30	Protein"	"spy0123	183	190	Protein"	"0136	193	197	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""spy0127"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""0130"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""spy0123"", ""start_span"": 183, ""end_span"": 190, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""0136"", ""start_span"": 193, ""end_span"": 197, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We created a spy0129 deletion mutant in strain SF370 ( SF370Deltaspy0129) to determine if genes contained within the spy0127 - 0130 cluster were directly involved in adherence to pharyngeal cells.	"spy0129	13	20	Protein"	"SF370Deltaspy0129	55	72	Protein"	"spy0127	117	124	Protein"	"0130	127	131	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""spy0129"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SF370Deltaspy0129"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""spy0127"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""0130"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We posited that a deletion in the spy0129 sortase gene may have the greatest overall effect on the production and processing of the gene products of this cluster, since both the spy0128 and spy0130 gene products do not localize to the cell - wall surface in the absence of the sortase enzyme [ 36].

FimA protein was not detectable in the fimR - mutant, while a 50% lower level of Mfa1 protein was found in the fimR - mutant compared with that in wild - type strain 33277.	"FimA	0	4	Protein"	"fimR	39	43	Protein"	"Mfa1	81	85	Protein"	"fimR	111	115	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FimA"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fimR"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Mfa1"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fimR"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In agreement with a previous report ( Nishikawa et al., 2004), rFimR did not bind to the fimA promoter region, suggesting that regulation of fimA expression by FimR is through a different mechanism.	"rFimR	63	68	Protein"	"fimA	89	93	Protein"	"fimA	141	145	Protein"	"FimR	160	164	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""rFimR"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fimA"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fimA"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FimR"", ""start_span"": 160, ""end_span"": 164, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The previous study suggested that regulation of fimA expression by FimR is through a regulation cascade involving interaction of FimR and the promoter region of the first gene in the fimA cluster ( Nishikawa et al., 2004).	"fimA	48	52	Protein"	"FimR	67	71	Protein"	"FimR	129	133	Protein"	"fimA	183	187	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""fimA"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FimR"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FimR"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fimA"", ""start_span"": 183, ""end_span"": 187, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Here it is demonstrated that FimR binds directly to the promoter region of the mfa1 gene, suggesting a direct role of FimR in activation of mfa1 expression.	"FimR	29	33	Protein"	"mfa1	79	83	Protein"	"FimR	118	122	Protein"	"mfa1	140	144	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FimR"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mfa1"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FimR"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mfa1"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Moreover, FimR appears to act on the promoter region identified here, suggesting that this promoter may make significant contributions toward mfa1 expression through the FimS / FimR system.	"FimR	10	14	Protein"	"mfa1	142	146	Protein"	"FimS	170	174	Protein"	"FimR	177	181	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FimR"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mfa1"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FimS"", ""start_span"": 170, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FimR"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 181, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Expression of major fimbriae ( FimA) is extremely low in the fimR mutant, and minor fimbriae production in this mutant is inhibited by least 50%.	"major fimbriae	14	28	Protein"	"FimA	31	35	Protein"	"fimR	61	65	Protein"	"minor fimbriae	78	92	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""major fimbriae"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FimA"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fimR"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""minor fimbriae"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This strategy led us to identify and characterize a point mutation in the phoP / phoR two - component regulatory system of H37Ra that has uncovered novel regulatory links, which impact on the secretion and T cell recognition of the major T cell antigens ESAT - 6 and CFP - 10.	"phoP	74	78	Protein"	"phoR	81	85	Protein"	"ESAT - 6	254	262	Protein"	"CFP - 10	267	275	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""phoR"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 254, ""end_span"": 262, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CFP - 10"", ""start_span"": 267, ""end_span"": 275, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Based on the known role of phoP in virulence [ 14], the H37Ra strain complemented with I36 ( H37Ra:: phoP) was accorded highest priority for further molecular characterization and functional analyses, whereas the two other recombinants ( H37Ra:: fadE5, H37Ra:: rpsL) served as controls.	"phoP	27	31	Protein"	"phoP	101	105	Protein"	"fadE5	246	251	Protein"	"rpsL	261	265	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fadE5"", ""start_span"": 246, ""end_span"": 251, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""rpsL"", ""start_span"": 261, ""end_span"": 265, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In contrast, splenocytes from H37Ra:: phoP inoculated mice showed very strong IFN - gamma production in response to incubation with ESAT - 6 and CFP - 10.	"phoP	38	42	Protein"	"IFN - gamma	78	89	Protein"	"ESAT - 6	132	140	Protein"	"CFP - 10	145	153	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IFN - gamma"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CFP - 10"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Figure 4A shows that infection of BM - DC with H37Ra or H37Ra:: rpsL induced no stimulation of the hybridoma as judged by IL - 2 production, while H37Ra:: phoP or H37Rv triggered high amounts of IL - 2 production in this very sensitive and specific test.

However, the most striking link in relation to our results on phoP and ESAT - 6 secretion that was revealed by these two transcriptional analyses, were the data on gene cluster rv3612c - rv3616c.	"phoP	62	66	Protein"	"ESAT - 6	71	79	Protein"	"rv3612c	177	184	Protein"	"rv3616c	187	194	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""rv3612c"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 184, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""rv3616c"", ""start_span"": 187, ""end_span"": 194, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It should be mentioned here that the SO2 phoP ko strain, which showed strong ESAT - 6 expression but little ESAT - 6 secretion ( Figure 5), induced only very reduced ESAT - 6 - specific T cell responses ( Figure 3).	"phoP	41	45	Protein"	"ESAT - 6	77	85	Protein"	"ESAT - 6	108	116	Protein"	"ESAT - 6 -	166	176	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ESAT - 6 -"", ""start_span"": 166, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As ESAT - 6 - specific T cell responses induced by this strain are low, ESAT - 6 - based IFN - gamma production assays might be used to differentiate between vaccination with SO2 and infection with wild - type M. tuberculosis.

Interestingly, one TCS ( Plu0102 / Plu103 and YE4185 / YE4186) is unique for the genera Photorhabdus and Yersinia.

BvgS / BvgR is the TCS of Y. enterocolitica that corresponds to AstS / AstR.

In Y. pestis, the production of YspI and YspR, the homologues of YenI and YenR, is induced at 26degreesC ( Table 1).

In the genome of P. luminescens, two genes encoding putative AHL - LuxR - like receptors, plu0320 and plu4562, but no luxI genes are present ( Fig. 3).

It is interesting to note that Sodalis glossinidius strain morsitans, an endosymbiont of the tse tse fly Glossina morsitans morsitans [ 38], also has two pontential AHL - LuxR receptors, SG1740 and SG0285, but no luxI homologue ( Fig. 3).

Most of the genes are located in two large gene clusters ( plu0918 - 0925 and plu2001 - 2019).

In P. luminescens, two LuxR - like receptors with a yet unidentified signalling binding site are present, Plu4274 and Plu1817, the latter of which is shared by Y. enterocolitica ( YE1621), but not by S. glossinidius.

P. luminescens, but not Y. enterocolitica, produces two members of the UspFG family, the UspG homologues Plu2030 and Plu2032 ( Tab. 2), indicating a global stress response induced by those Usp proteins that is different in both organisms.

Further RTX toxins are encoded by plu3217, plu3324 ( both RTX A - family), plu4117 ( own family), and plu3668 ( RTX cytotoxin), none of which is present in Y. enterocolitica.

Examples are SopB, a host cell invasion factor translocated via the type - III secretion system that is present in the emerging human pathogen P. asymbiotica, but not in the insect pathogen P. luminescens [ 14], a putative effector protein ( YE2447) with proteolytic activity, and a homologue of SrfA which is negatively regulated by PhoP in S. typhimurium [ 75].

Herein we report that a panel of serotype - matched GAS, which were clinically isolated from severe invasive but not from non - invaive infections, could abrogate functions of human polymorphnuclear neutrophils ( PMN) in at least two independent ways; due to inducing necrosis to PMN by enhanced production of a pore - forming toxin streptolysin O ( SLO) and due to impairment of PMN migration via digesting interleukin - 8, a PMN attracting chemokine, by increased production of a serine protease ScpC.

Streptolysin S ( SLS) is an oxygen - stable beta - hemolysin and Streptolysin O ( SLO) is a pore - forming cholesterol - binding toxin [ 16].

Although sequences of the slo gene and the scpC gene were identical among clinically isolated non - invasive and severe invasive GAS ( data not shown), Figure 5A shows that the slo and the scpC genes were expressed in the severe invasive GAS greater in extent than those in the non - invasive GAS.

Previous studies using animal - passaged GAS have shown that mutations in both csrS and csrR gene are important for the invasive phenotype [ 5], [ 6], and mutation frequency of csrS and csrR seems to be the same [ 21].	"csrS	79	83	Protein"	"csrR	88	92	Protein"	"csrS	177	181	Protein"	"csrR	186	190	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""csrS"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""csrR"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""csrS"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 181, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""csrR"", ""start_span"": 186, ""end_span"": 190, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
On the contrary of a dogma that CsrS / R is a definitive member of the two - component regulatory systems, which involve a coordinate pair of proteins known as the sensor kinase and the response regulator [ 20], CsrS may transmit a signal not only to CsrR but also to other regulators.

Therefore, the second important observation in the present study is that an essential requirement of csrS mutation for invasive infection is associated with increased expression of ScpC and SLO and in vitro evasion of PMN functions, though we do not exclude the possibility that other CsrS - regulating factors contribute to the escape of invasive GAS from host defense.

Four nucleoid - like proteins in enteric bacteria, H - NS, StpA, Hha, and YdgT have a predilection for binding to A + T rich sequences and repress transcription of SPI - 2 genes ( rev. in [ 14]).

It has been shown that virulence regulator slyA, and close homologues rovA [ 82] and toxT [ 83] act to relieve the repression caused by H - NS at specific promoters [ 48], [ 70], [ 84], [ 85].

In agreement with this model, SlyA and PhoP counteract H - NS silencing at pagC [ 85], [ 87].

Finally, complementation with a single integrated copy of rv2623 expressed from a constitutive mycobacterial promoter ( Deltarv2623 attB:: Phsp60Rv2623) abrogated the growth advantage of the deletion mutant ( Figure 3A).

Results of the complementation experiments were further validated using a complemented strain Deltarv2623 attB:: Prv2623Rv2623, whose expression of the wildtype universal stress protein is driven by the native rv2623 promoter [ 18] ( Figure 3D and E).

In contrast to the result of the guinea pig study, we observed no difference in the kinetics of infection between C57BL / 6 mice infected with wildtype M. tuberculosis, Deltarv2623, or the attB:: Phsp60 Rv2623 complemented strain in a low dose aerogenic model [ 19], as assessed by lung bacterial burden ( Figure 4A).

Importantly, thermal denaturation profiles of wild - type Rv2623, Rv2623D15E and Rv2623G117A demonstrated virtually identical Tm values, implying that the native Rv2623 fold was not destabilized by these mutations ( Figure 7C).

To examine whether the effects of overexpression of Rv2623 on M. smegmatis are operative in virulent M. tuberculosis, the growth kinetics of the Erdman strain overexpressing wildtype Rv2623, as well as the Rv2623G117A and the Rv2623D15E mutant proteins, were evaluated in vitro using the BACTEC 9000MB system ( Figure 8B).

Recent transcriptional analysis of Rv2623, while confirming the essentiality of the two 18 bp palindromic DosR - binding motifs that are present in the promoter region of this gene [ 38] for induction of Rv2623 under low oxygen conditions, also demonstrated the presence of additional regulatory elements within the rv2623 5 ' - untranslated region [ 18].

RetS is postulated to act in concert with two other TCS sensor kinase - response regulator hybrids, GacS and LadS, to coordinate the expression of determinants involved in biofilm formation and the production of determinants required for cytotoxicity in P. aeruginosa via the small regulatory RNA rsmZ [ 36], [ 37].

Interestingly, PA4102 ( BfmS), the cognate sensor of PA4101, was found to be phosphorylated following PA4101 phosphorylation after 72 hr of biofilm growth ( Table 1).	"PA4102	15	21	Protein"	"BfmS	24	28	Protein"	"PA4101	53	59	Protein"	"PA4101	102	108	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PA4102"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""BfmS"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PA4101"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PA4101"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
No evidence of phosphorylation of PA4197, PA4101, or GacS was detected in DeltaPA4197 mutant biofilm phosphorylation patterns.	"PA4197	34	40	Protein"	"PA4101	42	48	Protein"	"GacS	53	57	Protein"	"DeltaPA4197	74	85	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PA4197"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PA4101"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GacS"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""DeltaPA4197"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Since GacS was found to be phosphorylated in a BfiS - dependent manner following 8 hrs of growth, we asked whether a DeltagacS mutant forms biofilms similar in architecture to DeltabfiS biofilms.	"GacS	6	10	Protein"	"BfiS	47	51	Protein"	"DeltagacS	117	126	Protein"	"DeltabfiS	176	185	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GacS"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""BfiS"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""DeltagacS"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""DeltabfiS"", ""start_span"": 176, ""end_span"": 185, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The novelty of these TCS is further supported by the finding that a search for BfiS ( PA4197) and BfmR ( PA4101) homologues using BLAST ( http: / / blast. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov / Blast. cgi) and BLINK ( precomputed BLAST, [ 53]), did not reveal any proteins that have been previously characterized in the literature.

While our study did not result in the identification of RetS or LadS, we identified GacS by two different approaches and confirmed GacS phosphorylation by immunoblot analysis ( Table 1).	"RetS	56	60	Protein"	"LadS	64	68	Protein"	"GacS	84	88	Protein"	"GacS	131	135	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RetS"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""LadS"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GacS"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GacS"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
GacS acts as a suppressor of RetS ( and vice versa) with RetS regulating the suppressor activity of the membrane - bound sensor GacS by directly modulating its phosphorylation state [ 38].	"GacS	0	4	Protein"	"RetS	29	33	Protein"	"RetS	57	61	Protein"	"GacS	128	132	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GacS"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RetS"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RetS"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GacS"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Taken together, our observations suggest a link between the multi - component switch RetS / LadS / GacAS / RsmA which reciprocally regulates virulence and the transition between the planktonic and the surface attached mode of growth and the previously undescribed signaling network which regulates developmental steps once P. aeruginosa has committed to the surface associated lifestyle ( Fig. 6).

Further biochemical and quantitative proteomics data revealed three protein interactions with SrcA, including two effector cargos ( SseL and PipB2) and the type III - associated ATPase, SsaN, that increases the efficiency of effector translocation.

Using a reverse genetics approach we identified an SsrB - regulated gene ( STM2138) that we named srcA ( SsrB - regulated chaperone A), whose gene product satisfied several a priori predictions relating to the physical properties associated with T3SS chaperones.	"SsrB	51	55	Protein"	"STM2138	75	82	Protein"	"srcA	98	102	Protein"	"SsrB - regulated chaperone A	105	133	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""STM2138"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""srcA"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SsrB - regulated chaperone A"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The srcA gene is not located in the vicinity of the T3SS encoded by SPI - 2 ( STM1378 - STM1425), but is 713 genes downstream on the chromosome ( STM numbers are based on the LT2 genome and ordered sequentially on the chromosome beginning at STM0001, thrL).

To verify SsrB input on srcA expression, we analyzed SsrB binding in vivo at the region of DNA surrounding srcA using genome - wide ChIP - on - chip [ 21] ( and unpublished data).

A comparison of the SrcA dimer interface with other class I chaperone family members indicates the overall similarity of quaternary structure shared between SrcA, CesT and SicP ( Fig. 3A).

A structural alignment of SrcA and Spa15 generated through alignment of single monomers shows the relative difference in subunit orientation between SrcA and Spa15 reflected by the positions of each monomer in the dimer configuration.

To evaluate the potential for an effector - binding surface on SrcA, the structure of SicP in complex with its effector SptP was aligned with SrcA and represented as a space - filling model ( Fig. 3B).	"SrcA	63	67	Protein"	"SicP	86	90	Protein"	"SptP	120	124	Protein"	"SrcA	142	146	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SrcA"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SicP"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SptP"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SrcA"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
When SrcA was mixed with SsaN, a new protein complex of high molecular weight was observed, along with diminished peaks corresponding to the SrcA dimer and SsaN monomer ( Fig. 4C).

To further show a role for SrcA in chaperoning PipB2, we set up experiments to test whether deleting srcA would phenocopy DeltapipB2 cells for PipB2 - dependent centrifugal displacement of the Salmonella containing vacuole ( SCV) in epithelial cells, an event linked to cell - to - cell transfer during infection in vitro [ 29].

SseK2 is also regulated by the SsrA - SsrB two - component system but compared to SseK1, it is translocated in much less abundance into host cells [ 33].

Using the methods described here, we were not able to detect SseK2 secretion or a physical interaction with SrcA, however it remains possible that SrcA also chaperones SseK2 for low - level translocation.

In common with many other bacteria, ECM synthesis in Y. pestis is controlled by intracellular levels of cyclic di - GMP, which are determined by competing activities of the hmsT diguanylate cyclase and hmsP phosphodiesterase gene products [ 8], [ 9].

The gabD gene functions to produce succinate from both GABA and hydroxyphenylacetate ( HPA), an aromatic degradation product of Tyr and Phe; and the HPA transport ( hpaX) and catabolism ( hpaCBIFHDE) genes of Y. pestis were also highly upregulated in the flea gut ( Table S1, Fig. 2).

The Y. pestis homologs of Pseudomonas aeruginosa cupA1 and cupA3 in a predicted fimbrial biosynthesis operon and yapL, a predicted autotransporter adhesin similar to E. coli tibA, were specifically upregulated in the flea ( Table S1).

The transcriptional regulator gene phoP of the PhoPQ two - component regulatory system and the PhoP - regulated mgtC gene were expressed at levels > 2 - fold higher in fleas than in any other condition ( Tables 1, S1, S3).

Notably, seven transcriptional regulators were affected, including VjbR, ExoR and OmpR that were less expressed in the bvrR mutant.

As expected, these included genes that encoded OMPs like Omp25a ( BAB1 _ 0722) and Omp25d ( BAB1 _ 0115) which were down - regulated.

Although it has been showed that the mutants in the BvrR / BvrS system have no obvious defects with regard to the ability to grow on standard media [ 4], our microarray results suggests that the BvrR / BvrS system controls elements directly involved in adjusting the Brucella metabolism to the nutrient shift expected to occur during the transit to the intracellular niche.

In addition, DeJong and col [ 20] have demonstrated that among the promoters which expression is dependent of the VjbR regulator, is the ompR gene, the regulator of the OmpR / EnvZ two component system.	"VjbR	114	118	Protein"	"ompR	137	141	Protein"	"OmpR	169	173	Protein"	"EnvZ	176	180	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""VjbR"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ompR"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""OmpR"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""EnvZ"", ""start_span"": 176, ""end_span"": 180, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
E. coli OmpR / EnvZ system controls the transcription of the outer membrane porins OmpF and OmpC in response to osmolarity [ 23].

The fact that the expression of VjbR, OmpR and ExoR was altered in the bvrR mutant demonstrated for the first time an interaction or cross - talk among these global regulators, all involved in the control of composition and structure of the cell envelope ( OMPs, LPS, chaperones, flagella, em).

On the other hand, two genes for cell envelope proteins ( omp25d and one lipoprotein) and three denitrification genes ( norC, nirK and glutaminase BAB2 _ 0863) were less expressed intracellularly.

To characterize SeMac, the fragment of S. equi mac gene encoding mature SeMac was cloned, and recombinant SeMac was purified to > 95% purity as assessed by SDS - PAGE ( Fig. 3A).

Although both SeMac and GAS Mac efficiently cleave human IgG, they cannot cleave the majority of total horse IgG.

Cleavable horse IgG1 has PELLGG, while the non - cleavable horse IgG4 has PECLSVG in the same region, suggesting that the amino acid sequences of the lower hinge region are important for cleavability by SeMac and GAS Mac.
