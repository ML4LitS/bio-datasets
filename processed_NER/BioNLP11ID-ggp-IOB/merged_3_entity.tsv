This could be because PmrB is directly involved in sensing extracytoplasmic pH in a way analogous to its sensing of Fe3 + and Al3 + ( Wosten et al., 2000), or because PmrB plays an indirect role in its capacity of main ( if not sole) phosphodonor for PmrA.

P. entomophila gacA mutants are non - pathogenic and fail to trigger a systemic immune response after ingestion, indicating that the GacS / GacA two - component system regulates important bacterial virulence effectors required to infect and kill flies [ 9].	gacA,15,19,Protein	GacS,133,137,Protein	GacA,140,144,Protein	"[{""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GacS"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GacA"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
In P. fluorescens, membrane - localized anti - sigma factor PrtR cleaves the extracytoplasmic sigma factor PrtI, resulting in increased expression of multiple genes, including one encoding for a metalloprotease, aprX [ 16].

To test a possible role of prtR in the regulation of aprA expression, we analyzed the proteins present in the supernatant of prtR mutants.	prtR,27,31,Protein	aprA,53,57,Protein	prtR,125,129,Protein	"[{""token"": ""prtR"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""prtR"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Measurement of in vitro protease activity with azocasein revealed that the gacA mutant secretes no detectable protease activity and that prtR mutants retain only 30% of wild - type supernatant activity, thus indicating a role for PrtR in the regulation of P. entomophila protease secretion ( Figure 1F).	gacA,75,79,Protein	prtR,137,141,Protein	PrtR,230,234,Protein	"[{""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""prtR"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PrtR"", ""start_span"": 230, ""end_span"": 234, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Using the same assay, both prtR and gacA mutants were almost avirulent toward Drosophila indicating that both genes regulate other virulence factors in addition to AprA ( Figure 2B).	prtR,27,31,Protein	gacA,36,40,Protein	AprA,164,168,Protein	"[{""token"": ""prtR"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 168, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Whereas this food - uptake cessation was still observed in aprA and prtR mutants, it was not evident in gacA mutant - infected larvae ( Figure 2D and data not shown for prtR).	aprA,59,63,Protein	prtR,68,72,Protein	gacA,104,108,Protein	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""prtR"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
The data presented above clearly indicate that AprA is a major virulence factor of P. entomophila that promotes bacterial persistence and killing of the host, but that other virulence factors controlled by gacA and prtR exist.

Our previous study had already revealed that the humoral arm of the Drosophila immune response mediated by the Imd pathway contributes to resistance against orally transmitted P. entomophila, since flies mutated in the Relish ( Rel) gene showed a consistently increased mortality rate [ 9].

Whereas the titer of gacA mutants decreased with time, we observed that the aprA derivative persisted at a level similar to wild - type bacteria in Rel - deficient mutant flies and larvae ( Figure 3A and 3B, and unpublished data).	gacA,21,25,Protein	aprA,76,80,Protein	Rel,148,151,Protein	"[{""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Rel"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
It is interesting to note that in agreement with the results described above, persistence of both the aprA mutant and wild - type bacteria was significantly altered in fly lines over - expressing the Imd pathway, and that aprA mutants survived less than wild - type bacteria ( Figure 4B).	aprA,102,106,Protein	Imd,200,203,Protein	aprA,222,226,Protein	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 200, ""end_span"": 203, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 222, ""end_span"": 226, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
To ascertain that the protection was due to Imd pathway activation and not to a competition between P. entomophila and Ecc15, we next monitored resistance to P. entomophila of wild - type and Rel flies orally infected by Ecc15 evf -.	Imd,44,47,Protein	Rel,192,195,Protein	evf,227,230,Protein	"[{""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Rel"", ""start_span"": 192, ""end_span"": 195, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""evf"", ""start_span"": 227, ""end_span"": 230, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Thus, we next compared survival of Rel flies specifically expressing a wild - type copy of Rel in the intestine using caudal ( cad) - Gal4.

Figure 5E shows that Rel flies expressing Rel in the gut survive better than Rel mutant flies.

The Imd pathway regulates a large number of immune genes including those encoding AMPs; and two peptides, Diptericin and Attacin, are preferentially synthesized following bacterial infection in the digestive tract of Drosophila [ 7].

The difference in pathogenicity exhibited by gacA, prtR, and aprA mutants underlines the complexity of P. entomophila virulence factors.	gacA,45,49,Protein	prtR,51,55,Protein	aprA,61,65,Protein	"[{""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""prtR"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
The observation that both aprA and prtR, but not gacA, mutants retained the capacity to trigger a systemic immune response indicates a clear distinction between pathogenicity and immune activation.	aprA,26,30,Protein	prtR,35,39,Protein	gacA,49,53,Protein	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""prtR"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Another interesting feature of P. entomophila virulence is the food - uptake cessation which is observed in prtR and aprA but not in gacA mutants.	prtR,108,112,Protein	aprA,117,121,Protein	gacA,133,137,Protein	"[{""token"": ""prtR"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
The three remaining motility genes that were not significantly enriched are two chemoreceptor genes, trg and aer, and the filament cap chaperone, fliT.	trg,101,104,Protein	aer,109,112,Protein	fliT,146,150,Protein	"[{""token"": ""trg"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""aer"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fliT"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
In addition, it has been reported that fliT mutations enhance expression of class 2 flagellar operons [ 20] because FliT acts as a negative regulator of these operons by binding to and inhibiting the activity of FlhDC [ 21].	fliT,39,43,Protein	FliT,116,120,Protein	FlhDC,212,217,Protein	"[{""token"": ""fliT"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FliT"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FlhDC"", ""start_span"": 212, ""end_span"": 217, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
To investigate this possibility, we introduced flhDC - lacZ translational fusions in the deletion strains and performed beta - galactosidase assays.	flhDC,47,52,Protein	lacZ,55,59,Protein	beta - galactosidase,120,140,Protein	"[{""token"": ""flhDC"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""lacZ"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""beta - galactosidase"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Surprisingly, a large fraction of the mutants tested showed significant reduction in flhDC - lacZ expression values relative to the wild - type strain, demonstrating that the motility defects can be partly attributed to reduced expression of the flhDC operon.	flhDC,85,90,Protein	lacZ,93,97,Protein	flhDC,246,251,Protein	"[{""token"": ""flhDC"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""lacZ"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""flhDC"", ""start_span"": 246, ""end_span"": 251, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
We found that deletion of rcsB, rcsD, or rcsF was sufficient to rescue motility in both LPS and OPG mutants ( Figure S6), providing strong evidence that perturbations in these structures repress motility by signaling through the Rcs pathway.	rcsB,26,30,Protein	rcsD,32,36,Protein	rcsF,41,45,Protein	"[{""token"": ""rcsB"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""rcsD"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""rcsF"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
We also observed that sensitivity to chi - phage was higher in rfaI mutants than rfaC mutants, indicating that chi - phage infectivity is directly related to the degree of flhDC expression ( Figures 4, 5B, and 5C).	rfaI,63,67,Protein	rfaC,81,85,Protein	flhDC,172,177,Protein	"[{""token"": ""rfaI"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""rfaC"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""flhDC"", ""start_span"": 172, ""end_span"": 177, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Based on these observations, we hypothesized that this mutant has flagella with an extreme CCW rotation bias, a phenotype also exhibited, to varying degrees, by cheA, cheR, and cheW mutants [ 43].	cheA,161,165,Protein	cheR,167,171,Protein	cheW,177,181,Protein	"[{""token"": ""cheA"", ""start_span"": 161, ""end_span"": 165, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheR"", ""start_span"": 167, ""end_span"": 171, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheW"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 181, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
First, chi - phage infectivity assays with DeltayhjH mutants showed comparable levels of infection to cheR mutants ( which exhibit CCW flagellar rotation bias) in contrast to the reduced sensitivity displayed by cheZ mutants ( which have CW flagellar rotation bias), consistent with the z - scores of our chi - phage selection ( Figure 5E).

In a final functional test, individual cells of four different strains - wild - type cells and mutants with yhjH, cheR, and cheZ deletions - were tethered to a microscope slide and the frequency of flagellar rotation switching was measured using computer tracking software in a fashion similar to Block et al.	yhjH,108,112,Protein	cheR,114,118,Protein	cheZ,124,128,Protein	"[{""token"": ""yhjH"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheR"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheZ"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
The other half of DeltayhjH suppressor mutations were found to contain insertions within the intergenic region between the divergently transcribed genes yfgF and yfgG, which encode gene products of unknown function.	DeltayhjH,18,27,Protein	yfgF,153,157,Protein	yfgG,162,166,Protein	"[{""token"": ""DeltayhjH"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""yfgF"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""yfgG"", ""start_span"": 162, ""end_span"": 166, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
However, deletions of either yfgF or yfgG produced no measurable difference in motility in the DeltayhjH background ( Figure S9).	yfgF,29,33,Protein	yfgG,37,41,Protein	DeltayhjH,95,104,Protein	"[{""token"": ""yfgF"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""yfgG"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""DeltayhjH"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Conversely, overexpression of yfgF ( but not yfgG) was found to suppress the motility defect of DeltayhjH mutants ( Figure 6E).	yfgF,30,34,Protein	yfgG,45,49,Protein	DeltayhjH,96,105,Protein	"[{""token"": ""yfgF"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""yfgG"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""DeltayhjH"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
The mechanisms by which deletion of yegE and overexpression of yfgF suppress the motility defect of DeltayhjH mutants are discussed in the next section.	yegE,36,40,Protein	yfgF,63,67,Protein	DeltayhjH,100,109,Protein	"[{""token"": ""yegE"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""yfgF"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""DeltayhjH"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Based on sequence homology, YhjH, YfgF, and YegE belong to the newly identified and highly prevalent family of proteins that function in the turnover of bis - ( 3 ' - 5 ') - cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate ( c - di - GMP), which is a second messenger involved in the regulation of a wide variety of bacterial behaviors [ 49].

Based on these observations, we propose that deleting yegE and over - expressing yfgF suppress the motility defect of the DeltayhjH strain by reducing the intracellular levels of c - di - GMP ( Figure 7).	yegE,54,58,Protein	yfgF,81,85,Protein	DeltayhjH,122,131,Protein	"[{""token"": ""yegE"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""yfgF"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""DeltayhjH"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Such an interaction may explain the observed rotational bias of flagella in DeltayhjH mutants ( Figure 6B) and is in agreement with our finding that mutations in ycgR strongly suppress the motility defects of DeltayhjH mutants ( Figure 6F).

Mutations in ycgR were also found to suppress the swarming defect of the DeltayfiR strain ( unpublished data), suggesting that YcgR binds c - di - GMP to affect both swimming and swarming motility.	ycgR,13,17,Protein	DeltayfiR,73,82,Protein	YcgR,127,131,Protein	"[{""token"": ""ycgR"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""DeltayfiR"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""YcgR"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
The fimS mutant exhibited a level of fimbriation similar to fimB - fimE - double mutants locked in phase ON ( Figure S11A), indicating that a high level of fimbriation reduces motility in semi - solid agar.	fimS,4,8,Protein	fimB,60,64,Protein	fimE,67,71,Protein	"[{""token"": ""fimS"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fimB"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fimE"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test

The two strains containing a truncated RopB ( 5628 and 5448R -) demonstrated similarly reduced virulence compared to the two strains containing a full - length RopB ( 5628R + and 5448) ( Fig. 4B), confirming that inactivation of RopB results in decreased virulence in systemic infection.

Recently, we and others have found a connection between inactivation of SpeB through mutation in the two - component regulatory system covR / S and development of invasive disease in the murine model [ 37], [ 38].

Of the down - regulated genes in CovR / S mutant strains, SpeB would appear to be one of the most important due to its ability to degrade many host and self - proteins.

Furthermore, the switch to a SpeB - negative phenotype appeared to occur exclusively through mutations in covR / S.

This result suggests that covR / S mutations are the predominant method of phenotypic switching in GAS and that ropB mutation is not readily selected for in vivo.	covR,26,30,Protein	S,33,34,Protein	ropB,112,116,Protein	"[{""token"": ""covR"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""S"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ropB"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
This leads to the conclusion that ropB mutation in 5628 does not represent a similar mechanism to covR / S mutation and may ( a) be an incidental occurrence or ( b) arise secondary to different selection pressures than those associated with the shift to invasive infection.	ropB,34,38,Protein	covR,98,102,Protein	S,105,106,Protein	"[{""token"": ""ropB"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""covR"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""S"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
The clinical isolate 5628 expressing a truncated RopB, as well as the allelic exchange mutant 5448R - also expressing the truncated RopB from 5628, showed reduced virulence compared to strains containing a full - length RopB.

While co - immunoprecipiatation has proven valuable in identifying targets of Hfq, and thus targets of translational regulation, one possible criticism of this approach is that the RNA co - immunoprecipitated with Hfq may be brought down simply because Hfq strongly binds to RNA molecules and that the binding is somewhat non - specific.
