When SpeB expression is limited, several streptococcal proteins necessary for adherence remain intact [ 24, 32, 33]; thus, decreased SpeB production ( as indicated here) may promote pharyngeal cell attachment.

Furthermore, SpeB abolishes internalization ( following adherence) of certain streptococcal strains by epithelial cells ( including Detroit 562 cells), a process mediated in part by the fibronectin - binding protein F [ 34, 35].

The speH gene ( spy1008) was induced, and the remaining genes, hypothetically involved in replication and regulation [ 39], were downregulated.

Increased expression of speH during pharyngeal cell adherence suggests that the SpeH exotoxin is either necessary for adherence, or is a component of a downstream infection process.

To determine if SpeH plays a direct role in the adherence process, we created a deletion mutant in strain SF370 ( SF370DeltaspeH), which was confirmed by PCR ( unpublished data) and RT - PCR ( Figure 1A) and tested in vitro for adherence to human pharyngeal cells.

For example, we initially identified ( Table 1) the significant upregulation of three of the five known gene members of the folate biosynthetic pathway [ 40] ( spy1096 - 1100), but GenomeCrawler identified a significant cluster containing all five genes ( Table 3 and Figure 2B).

We obtained a similar result for the eight - gene operon encoding the F0F1 - type proton translocating ATPase [ 41] ( spy0754 - 0761).

For example, the streptolysin operon encodes an internal terminator downstream of the sagA gene ( the first gene in the operon), which modulates the abundance of particular mRNA species ( e. g., sagA mRNA versus the polycistronic message for all nine genes) under different environmental conditions [ 45].

Recently, it was reported that the four genes spanning spy0127 - 0130 encode, and are responsible for, the formation of surface - localized, trypsin - resistant pili that induce protective immunity against a lethal dose of group A streptococci in a mouse model of infection [ 36].

We determined experimentally that cluster spy0127 - 0130 is an operon, verifying both related function and regulation of the gene members.

Allelic replacement created two putative deletion mutants; however, RT - PCR analysis ( Figure 4A) revealed that only one such clone ( SF370Deltaspy0129. 2) was a true knock - out for the spy0129 gene and useful for further study.

These results suggest that either the spy0130 gene product is involved directly in adherence, or that due to the elimination of the sortase, the pili, which may function in their entirety as adhesins, were not assembled on the surface of the mutant.

We are working to produce an in - frame deletion of spy0128 and a spy0130 single knock - out mutant to delineate the contribution of each individual clustered gene product to adherence.

Another cluster, spy1725 - 1719, contained six genes that together ( though not individually) exhibited significant downregulation.

We examined the spy1725 and spy1723 gene products ( annotated as hypothetical proteins [ 14]) for similarities with known proteins that might indicate a role for these gene products in protein biosynthesis.

The spy1723 gene product has similar domain structure to the YlxR protein of S. pneumoniae, an RNA - binding protein implicated in transcription termination [ 53].

A P. gingivalis fimA mutant shows impaired invasion capability of epithelial cells compared with wild - type strain, suggesting the involvement of FimA in the bacterial interaction with surface receptor ( s) on gingival cells ( Weinberg et al., 1997).

Coadhesion and biofilm development between P. gingivalis and Streptococcus gordonii require the interaction of Mfa1 with streptococcal protein SspB ( Park et al., 2005).

In a nutrient - limited medium, expression of FimA and Mfa1 are inhibited in P. gingivalis, whereas such differences are not found in gingipain expression.

Whereas the attenuation of BCG is due mainly to loss of the ESAT - 6 secretion system, ESX - 1, the reason why H37Ra is attenuated remained unknown.

Firstly, we constructed a partially diploid H37Ra knock - in strain carrying cosmid RD1 - ppe68 - ko that, in BCG yields the greatest amounts of ESAT - 6 expression and secretion [ 24].	"ppe68	90	95	Protein"	"ESAT - 6	145	153	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ppe68"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, in comparison to the corresponding MT103 wild - type strain, the SO2 strain showed a strongly reduced ESAT - 6 and CFP - 10 specific T cell response, corresponding to a similar low level as the H37Ra strain ( Figure 3B).	"ESAT - 6	111	119	Protein"	"CFP - 10	124	132	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CFP - 10"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We have previously shown that antigen - specific IFN - gamma production of splenocytes is a reliable readout system to evaluate whether or not ESAT - 6 was secreted by recombinant strains [ 23, 24, 26].	"IFN - gamma	49	60	Protein"	"ESAT - 6	143	151	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IFN - gamma"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, in order to determine the reason for the observed failure of H37Ra to induce ESAT - 6 - specific responses, H37Rv and H37Ra strains were tested for their potential to express and secrete ESAT - 6 in vitro.	"ESAT - 6	83	91	Protein"	"ESAT - 6	193	201	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 193, ""end_span"": 201, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The western blot analysis presented in Figure 5 shows that the cell lysates of H37Ra and H37Ra:: rpsL contain large amounts of ESAT - 6, indicating that the antigen is properly expressed.	"rpsL	97	101	Protein"	"ESAT - 6	127	135	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""rpsL"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, hardly any ESAT - 6 was present in the culture filtrates of these cultures, indicating that these strains were unable to secrete ESAT - 6 under the in vitro conditions employed in spite of proper expression.	"ESAT - 6	20	28	Protein"	"ESAT - 6	138	146	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In contrast, from examination of the western blots of M. tuberculosis H37Ra:: phoP and H37Rv it is clear that a large portion of their ESAT - 6 protein is secreted into the culture filtrates.	"phoP	78	82	Protein"	"ESAT - 6	135	143	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Analysis of the M. tuberculosis MT103 phoP ko strain SO2 showed strong expression of ESAT - 6, but only very little secreted ESAT - 6 ( Figure 5).	"ESAT - 6	85	93	Protein"	"ESAT - 6	125	133	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These findings are consistent with data from a previous transcriptional study [ 12] and suggest that the proposed ability of PhoP to downregulate its own expression [ 22] is affected by the S219L phoP mutation [ 29].	"PhoP	125	129	Protein"	"phoP	196	200	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PhoP"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 196, ""end_span"": 200, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
They also indicate that it is not a lack of phoP expression that is causing the phoP - associated effects in H37Ra.	"phoP	44	48	Protein"	"phoP	80	84	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In the bacterial world the PhoP / PhoR like two - component systems are widely distributed and fulfill a large variety of functions including sensing phosphate and magnesium [ 32, 33], or regulating virulence genes [ 34].	"PhoP	27	31	Protein"	"PhoR	34	38	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PhoP"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PhoR"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
For M. tuberculosis, several studies have described a link between the inactivation of phoP and loss of virulence, suggesting that the phoP gene is required for intracellular growth of M. tuberculosis [ 14, 25].	"phoP	87	91	Protein"	"phoP	135	139	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It was also found that the PhoP - PhoR system controls the biosynthesis of polyketide - derived lipids [ 35] and determines the amount of triacylated and monoacylated lipoarabinomannans in M. tuberculosis [ 36].	"PhoP	27	31	Protein"	"PhoR	34	38	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PhoP"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PhoR"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Finally, microarray - based trancriptome analysis using the wild - type versus a phoP ko mutant of H37Rv has provided an overview of the transcriptional regulation linked to PhoP [ 21].	"phoP	81	85	Protein"	"PhoP	174	178	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PhoP"", ""start_span"": 174, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This finding argues that the PhoP S219L mutation likely has a broad impact on gene regulation in H37Ra with effects similar to those seen for complete inactivation of phoP.	"PhoP	29	33	Protein"	"phoP	167	171	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PhoP"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 167, ""end_span"": 171, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
There were also several ppe genes that seem to be regulated by phoP but not ppe68 [ 21].	"phoP	63	67	Protein"	"ppe68	76	81	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ppe68"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Moreover, the expression values of genes rv3612c - rv3616c in H37Rv described in the article by Gao et al.	"rv3612c	41	48	Protein"	"rv3616c	51	58	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""rv3612c"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""rv3616c"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
[ 12] show substantial differences between cultures grown in roller bottles relative to cultures grown in shake flasks, arguing that this gene cluster might be regulated by environmental conditions through the PhoP / PhoR system.	"PhoP	210	214	Protein"	"PhoR	217	221	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PhoP"", ""start_span"": 210, ""end_span"": 214, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PhoR"", ""start_span"": 217, ""end_span"": 221, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore, rv3614c - rv3616c were reported to be transiently upregulated in the phagosome and under acidic stress [ 38].	"rv3614c	13	20	Protein"	"rv3616c	23	30	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""rv3614c"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""rv3616c"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Our results obtained for ESAT - 6 expression ( Figure 5) and the transcriptome data from Gao and colleagues [ 12] argue against direct downregulation of ESAT - 6 in H37Ra.	"ESAT - 6	25	33	Protein"	"ESAT - 6	153	161	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
By complementation with the wild - type copy of PhoP, we obtained a significant increase in virulence in ex vivo and animal models as well as restoration of ESAT - 6 secretion and the accompanying antigen - specific immunological recognition by sensitized splenocytes or T cell hybridomas.	"PhoP	48	52	Protein"	"ESAT - 6	157	165	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PhoP"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 165, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The link described here between mutation of phoP and consequences on ESAT - 6 secretion, however, appears to be one factor that significantly contributes to attenuation.	"phoP	44	48	Protein"	"ESAT - 6	69	77	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, our results once more emphasize the great importance of the ESX - 1 system for tubercle bacilli and provide important new information about the phoP - associated virulence regulation in M. tuberculosis.	"ESX - 1	66	73	Protein"	"phoP	150	154	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ESX - 1"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Primary variants are found to produce extracellular protease, extracellular lipase, intracellular protein crystals CipA and CipB, antibiotics, and are bioluminescent.

Both sensor kinases Plu0102 and YE4185 are of moderate similarity ( 31. 5% identity, 48. 5% homology).

Therefore, Plu0102 and YE4185 are interesting candidates for unravelling invertebrate - specific signals.	"Plu0102	11	18	Protein"	"YE4185	23	29	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Plu0102"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""YE4185"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The role of PhoP / PhoQ in regulating virulence gene expression has been characterized mainly in Salmonella species, but has also been shown, in addition to three other TCSs, to be important for virulence of Y. pseudotuberculosis [ 29, 30].

The AstS / AstR TCS is required for the correct timing of phase variant switching in P. luminescens [ 28].

Both Y. enterocolitica and P. luminescens produce the KdpD / KdpE system that regulates K + homeostasis and osmotic stress.

Therefore, the KdpD / KdpE system is also a further candidate system which might be involved in the regulation of insecticidal activity of Y. enterocolitica.	"KdpD	15	19	Protein"	"KdpE	22	26	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""KdpD"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""KdpE"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The only TCS of P. luminescens absent in Y. enterocolitica is TctE / TctD ( Fig. 2, marked in blue), which, however, is found in the genomes of Y. intermedia and Y. frederiksenii.	"TctE	62	66	Protein"	"TctD	69	73	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TctE"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TctD"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
"Beside these microorganisms, TctE / TctD homologues controlling the transport of tricarboxylic acid ( see section "" Tricarboxylate utilization "") are present in the genera Salmonella, Burkholderia, Agrobacterium, Bordetella, Collinsella, Xylella, Xanthomonas, and Pseudomonas, particularly P. entomophila, all of which are found in association with eukaryotes."

Moreover, we identified a second AHL - LuxR regulator, YE1026, which lacks a separate AHL synthase ( Fig. 3).	"LuxR	39	43	Protein"	"YE1026	55	61	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LuxR"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""YE1026"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Regulation by PAS _ 4 / LuxR - like receptors	"PAS _ 4	14	21	Protein"	"LuxR	24	28	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PAS _ 4"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""LuxR"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
35 of these potential LuxR - like receptors exhibit PAS _ 4 signal binding domains instead of an AHL - binding domain, and two have a signalling domain with a yet unidentified motif ( Fig. 3).	"LuxR	22	26	Protein"	"PAS _ 4	52	59	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LuxR"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PAS _ 4"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It is interesting to note that there is only one bacterium else, the insect colonizing S. glossinidius, whose genome also carries a series of unclustered genes coding for PAS _ 4 / LuxR - like receptors, indicating that this kind of receptors plays a role during insect infection.	"PAS _ 4	171	178	Protein"	"LuxR	181	185	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PAS _ 4"", ""start_span"": 171, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""LuxR"", ""start_span"": 181, ""end_span"": 185, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, the potential PAS _ 4 / LuxR - like receptors of P. luminescens, Y. enterocolitica, and S. glossinidius might sense JH or other eukaryotic hormones of the insect to adapt their gene expression to the insect host.	"PAS _ 4	25	32	Protein"	"LuxR	35	39	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PAS _ 4"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""LuxR"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This hypothesis is underlined by the fact that not more than five PAS _ 4 / LuxR - like receptors are present in S. glossinidius for which only one insect host has been reported.

In E. coli, the sequence motif of Usp proteins is not highly conserved: UspA and UspC show a sequence identity of 37% and a homology of 57%, for example.

In contrast, the UspA and the UspE homologues of P. luminescens and Y. enterocolitica are nearly similar, indicating that an identical stress response is regulated by these proteins.

It is discussed that the AstS / AstR - system prevents or delays phenotypic variation by protecting the cell from stress [ 18].

Phenotypic variation and thus the switch between mutualism and pathogenicity in P. luminescens is proposed to be regulated by a Ner - like and a HexA - like regulator that repress primary variant specific genes in the stage of the secondary variant [ 17].

Therefore, UspA might have a global importance in P. luminescens notifying stress and transmitting signals for HexA [ 18].

Proteins containing a so - called GGDEF domain are responsible for the synthesis of c - di - GMP, and those with a so - called EAL domain for its degradation.

Mutation of csrR or csrS can cause significant alterations in virulence in mouse models of infection, either increasing lethality or the severity of localized soft tissue lesions [ 5], [ 6].

The nucleotide sequence of the csrR gene was identical in all the isolates, and that of the csrS gene was identical among the all non - invasive GAS isolates ( data not shown).

In order to clarify the role of CsrS regarding expression of the virulence - associated genes and resistance to PMN killing, we introduced the intact csrS gene of the 1566 strain into the severe invasive GAS ( see Figure 5A).

The non - invasive 1566 strain displayed the LD50 value approximately 100 - fold higher than that of the severe invasive NIH230 strain ( Table 1), whereas a csrS deletion ( 1566DeltacsrS) caused an increase in the LD50 value comparable to that of the NIH230 strain.

Consistently, an introduction of the intact csrS gene into the NIH230 strain ( NIH230:: csrS +) reduced the LD50 value to the level observed in the non - invasive strain.

As shown in Figure 7A, the NIH230 strain caused bacteremia in mice 24 h after intraperitoneal injection whereas the bacteremia was barely detected in mice infected with NIH230:: csrS + as well as the 1566 strain ( p = 0. 005 compared with non - invasive isolates, and p = 0. 005 compared with invasive isolates + CsrS).

As shown in Table 1, NIH230scpC and NIH230slo exerted the LD50 value 3 - 10 fold lower than that of the non - invasive isolate 1566, but 10 - 30 fold higher than that of severe invasive isolates.

It have been demonstrated that CsrS / R is a member of the two - component regulatory systems for regulating the multipe virulence factors of GAS, by using genetically - manipulated GAS mutants [ 20].

Introduction of the intact csrS gene into the severe invasive GAS restored the susceptibility to the killing by PMN and abrogated the activity for inhibition of PMN recruitment and survival, thus, demonstrating an instructional role of the loss - of - functional mutations in csrS gene for the evasion of PMN functions, providing unique pathophysiology of invasive GAS infections.

Although gene expression was measured in a mutant background, both PAO1 and PA3553:: lux had similar biofilm phenotypes in each condition tested ( Fig 6A).

Taken together, these data indicate that P. aeruginosa can sense the presence of Mg2 +, Ca2 + or Mn2 + and that chelation of these same cations by DNA results in induction of the PA3552 - PA3559 LPS modification operon.	"PA3552	179	185	Protein"	"PA3559	188	194	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PA3552"", ""start_span"": 179, ""end_span"": 185, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PA3559"", ""start_span"": 188, ""end_span"": 194, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To determine if DNA - induced expression of PA3552 - PA3559 resulted in increased resistance to antimicrobials, antibiotic susceptibility testing of P. aeruginosa biofilms grown in the presence and absence of extracellular DNA was performed.	"PA3552	44	50	Protein"	"PA3559	53	59	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PA3552"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PA3559"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We have shown previously that the PA3552 - PA3559 operon is required for resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides in planktonic cultures grown in limiting magnesium conditions [ 47].

To determine if DNA - induced resistance requires these genes in biofilms, the resistance phenotype of the PA3553:: lux mutant was determined.	"PA3553	107	113	Protein"	"lux	116	119	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PA3553"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""lux"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
PA3553:: lux had no significant DNA - induced CAP resistance in biofilm or planktonic cultures, confirming that these genes are essential for CAP resistance in the presence of extracellular DNA ( Table 1).

The biofilms formed by the PA3553:: lux mutant were unaltered compared to PAO1 biofilms under these conditions, ensuring that the difference observed was not due to an altered biofilm phenotype ( Fig 6B).

As an intracellular pathogen, the PhoPQ system of Salmonella typhimurium is activated by limiting magnesium in vitro and phoP - regulated genes are also induced after invasion of macrophages and epithelial cells [ 65].

PhoQ mutants, which constitutively express phoP and are constitutively resistant to cationic antimicrobial peptides, are also more resistant to aminoglycosides [ 43].

We report here that DNA - induces aminoglycoside resistance in P. aeruginosa biofilms, and this resistance is partially dependent on the LPS modification operon PA3552 - PA3559.	"PA3552	161	167	Protein"	"PA3559	170	176	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PA3552"", ""start_span"": 161, ""end_span"": 167, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PA3559"", ""start_span"": 170, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This coincides with the localization of a CAP - tolerant subpopulation of bacteria that expresses the PA3552 - PA3559 operon along the surface of mushroom - structured P. aeruginosa biofilms [ 49].	"PA3552	102	108	Protein"	"PA3559	111	117	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PA3552"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PA3559"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, our data indicates that the presence of DNA in biofilms does indeed result in a cation - limited environment, resulting in the induction of the LPS modification operon PA3552 - PA3559.	"PA3552	177	183	Protein"	"PA3559	186	192	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PA3552"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 183, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PA3559"", ""start_span"": 186, ""end_span"": 192, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, it appears that there are multiple environmental signals in the CF lung that can induce the expression the PA3552 - PA3559 operon, which may explain why many P. aeruginosa CF isolates show LPS modifications such as aminoarabinose addition to lipid A [ 78].	"PA3552	118	124	Protein"	"PA3559	127	133	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PA3552"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PA3559"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As many P. aeruginosa strains isolated from the CF lung overproduce the negatively charged EPS alginate, we hypothesized that alginate may also be a relevant in vivo signal inducing expression of the PA3552 - PA3559 operon.	"PA3552	200	206	Protein"	"PA3559	209	215	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PA3552"", ""start_span"": 200, ""end_span"": 206, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PA3559"", ""start_span"": 209, ""end_span"": 215, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, our data suggests that the success of DNAseI therapy may, in part, be attributed to the degradation of DNA and subsequent disarming of the PhoPQ / PmrAB response and antibiotic resistance mechanisms.	"PhoPQ	148	153	Protein"	"PmrAB	156	161	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PhoPQ"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PmrAB"", ""start_span"": 156, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore, these findings indicate that DNA - rich environments, such as bacterial biofilms or the CF lung, may represent the natural setting where bacterial growth is cation limited, and highlight the importance of the PhoPQ / PmrAB controlled response and LPS modifications in antibiotic resistance in biofilms.

This study aims at evaluating the importance of the two - component regulatory system VicRK to virulence of the horse pathogen Streptococcus equi subspecies equi and the potential of a vicK mutant as a live vaccine candidate using mouse infection models.

DeltavicK grows less slowly than the parent strain but retains the ability of S. equi to resist to phagocytosis by polymorphoneuclear leukocytes, suggesting that the vicK deletion causes growth defect.

The hyaluronic acid capsule and S. equi M - like protein ( SeM) are both required for the resistance to phagocytosis by PMNs [ 16 - 17].

The growth curve of the DeltavicK mutant in THY displays a longer early growth phase and smaller slope in the exponential growth phase than that of the parent strain ( Fig. 2A), indicating that the vicK deletion detrimentally affects S. equi growth.

To determine whether the DeltavicK deletion affects the resistance of S. equi to phagocytosis by PMNs, the phagocytosis of wild - type and DeltavicK bacteria by PMNs in non - immune horse and rabbit blood was compared.

The spy1718:: aad mutant of S. pyogenes, which is no longer resistant to phagocytosis by PMNs, was used as a positive control in the assay.

The percentages of PMNs with associated wild - type S. equi and spy1718:: aad were low and high, respectively, indicating that the assay worked well to evaluate resistance of the bacteria to phagocytosis.

There was no significant difference in the percentages of PMNs associated with wild - type and DeltavicK bacteria at both time points and in both horse and rabbit blood ( Fig. 3), indicating that the DeltavicK mutant retains the ability of S. equi to resist to phagocytosis by PMNs.	"DeltavicK	95	104	Protein"	"DeltavicK	200	209	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltavicK"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""DeltavicK"", ""start_span"": 200, ""end_span"": 209, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To test whether DeltavicK infection confers immunity against S. equi infection, the seven mice recovered from the subcutaneous DeltavicK infection was reinfected subcutaneously with 1. 5 x 108 cfu wild - type S. equi 30 days after the first infection and monitored for 18 days.

To examine the humoral immune responses in the intranasal DeltavicK infection, nasal wash and serum samples were collected from the 8 mice infected intranasally with DeltavicK and 3 surviving mice infected with the wild - type S. equi 30 days after infection.

Thus, the DeltavicK mutant has the ability to induce mucosal and systemic immune responses, though there was host variation in these responses caused by DeltavicK infection.	"DeltavicK	10	19	Protein"	"DeltavicK	153	162	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltavicK"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""DeltavicK"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 162, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, the DeltavicK mutant is attenuated in virulence in both mouse models of subcutaneous and intranasal S. equi infections, indicating that VicRK is important to virulence.	"DeltavicK	13	22	Protein"	"VicRK	145	150	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltavicK"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""VicRK"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
S. equi DeltavicK mutant does not grow as well as the wild - type strain in both THY and blood, suggesting that the vicK deletion causes defect in growth, a plausible reason that likely contributes to the attenuation of S. equi virulence in the mouse infection models.	"DeltavicK	8	17	Protein"	"vicK	116	120	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltavicK"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""vicK"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This suggestion is further supported by the observations that both the wild - type and DeltavicK mutant strains are resistant to phagocytosis by PMNs, which suggest that VicRK is not required for the evasion of S. equi to the innate immunity.	"DeltavicK	87	96	Protein"	"VicRK	170	175	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltavicK"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""VicRK"", ""start_span"": 170, ""end_span"": 175, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, whether DeltavicK can be an effective live vaccine and whether the DeltavicK mutant has any advantages over the current live S. equi vaccine require the test of the mutant in horses since S. equi does not naturally infect mice.

To assess the effects of growth conditions on expression of the SPI - 2 secretion apparatus we constructed a lacZ transcriptional fusion to ssaG, a component of the secretion apparatus, and tested expression in each mutant background under each of the four growth conditions.

At the same time we determined transcript levels via quantitative real - time PCR ( qRT - PCR), using transcripts from rpoD and gyrB as controls [ 51].

Note that rpoE and hfq mutants showed a dramatic reduction in macrophage survival, but little difference in transcription of SPI - 2 genes during growth in AMM.

It has recently been reported that the translational regulator Hfq, regulates translation of RpoE explaining in part why the two mutations behave similarly [ 54].

We analyzed expression of each of the 123 genes and found that only two genes ( pepA and mopB) are negatively regulated; the remaining 121 are positively regulated.

So, in Figure 6B all regulatory effects on SPI - 2 have been removed except for those mediated directly by slyA and ssrB based on additional genetic data as described below.

Expression of an episomal copy of ssrB resulted in expression of SPI - 2 genes in each mutant background, suggesting that SsrB is epistatic to other regulators for SPI - 2 transcription.

This result is in agreement with the model shown in Figure 6 where all positive regulation takes place via either ssrB or slyA or both as tested further below.

slyA transcriptional activation by PhoP has been reported [ 63], [ 64].	"slyA	0	4	Protein"	"PhoP	35	39	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""slyA"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PhoP"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To determine epistatic relationships, we introduced a slyA - expressing plasmid, pBAD30SlyA, into each regulatory mutant and examined complementation in each mutant background compared to an empty vector control ( Figure 7C).

This suggests that slyA can regulate expression of SPI - 2 in a way that is independent of ssrB.

This result is striking, given that STM3117 - 3120 are not transcribed under a variety of in vitro conditions including AMM1 and 2 and the many conditions corresponding to the transcriptional profiles reported for microarrays archived in GEO ( [ 68], J.

The multiple promoters located within SPI - 2 presumably respond to differences in ssrB / slyA activation, perhaps establishing part of the temporal order of expression following phagocytosis of Salmonella.

For rpoE and rpoS it is possible that the environmental conditions that distinguish growth in minimal media from those in the SCV inside hosts are sensed via these two alternative sigma factors.

Post - transcriptional SPI - 2 regulation is a likely explanation for the large intracellular growth defects observed in the mutant smpB and hfq derivatives despite relative small transcriptional effects.

Similarly SsrB binds upstream of ssrA in a region of the promoter typical of response regulators but has no obvious recognition site and binds within the operons that encode structural components of the type III secretion system [ 52], [ 81].

[ 81] found that there was no consensus SsrB binding site or distance relative to the transcription start sites and Walthers ( ibid) proposes that different promoters may be activated by distinct SsrB mechanisms.

Biochemical analysis of purified Rv2623 suggested that this mycobacterial USP binds ATP, and the 2. 9 - A - resolution crystal structure revealed that Rv2623 engages ATP in a novel nucleotide - binding pocket.

Exposure to these stimuli results in the induction of approximately50 M. tuberculosis genes, designated the dormancy regulon, via the two - component regulatory system DosR - DosS ( see Table S1 for accession numbers) [ 3], [ 4], [ 5].

Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rv2623 regulates growth in vitro An rv2623 - deletion mutant of the virulent M. tuberculosis Erdman strain was generated by specialized transduction [ 12].

The rv2623 - specific allelic exchange construct was delivered via recombinant mycobacteriophage phAE159 and transformants were analyzed by Southern blot, confirming replacement of rv2623 with the hyg gene, which confers hygromycin resistance ( Figure 1A).

Indeed, the Deltarv2623 mutant was markedly more virulent relative to wildtype Erdman M. tuberculosis following aerogenic infection, as assessed by the mean survival time of C3H / HeJ mice infected with these strains ( 62 and 25. 5 days post infection for Erdman - and Deltarv2623 - infected mice, respectively, p = 0. 0014; Figure 4B).

Together, the animal studies provide strong evidence that Rv2623 regulates the growth of M. tuberculosis in vivo: in the absence of Rv2623, the tubercle bacillus fails to establish a chronic persistent infection, exhibiting a hypervirulent phenotype.

These results support the notion that it is unlikely that M. tuberculosis Rv2623 is essential for resistance to stresses encountered in the host, which is consistent with the observed in vivo hypervirulence phenotype of Deltarv2623.

SDS - PAGE analysis of affinity - purified His6 - Rv2623 revealed a single band that approximates the predicted molecular mass of approximately31. 6 kDa, which was identified by immunoblotting as Rv2623 ( Figure S3).

Gel filtration analysis of native His6 - Rv2623 revealed that the purified protein exists primarily as a single species with an apparent molecular mass of 61 + / - 1 kDa; suggesting that Rv2623 is a dimer under native conditions ( Figure S3), an observation that was later confirmed using nano electrospray ionization ( nano ESI) mass spectrometry ( data not shown).

An HPLC - based examination of supernatants from boiled samples of His6 - Rv2623 demonstrated that His6 - Rv2623 co - purifies with both ATP and ADP ( Figure 5).

Analysis of E. coli - expressed Rv2623 using nano ESI mass spectrometry also demonstrated that an ATP - saturated form of dimeric Rv2623 ( composed of 2 bound ATP molecules per monomer) constitutes at least half of the purified sample ( data not shown).

To examine the biochemical mechanisms responsible for Rv2623 function, we determined the crystal structure of wild - type Rv2623 at a resolution of 2. 9 A.

To gain insight into the ATP - binding mode ( s) exhibited by Rv2623, the structural features of the ATP - binding pocket of domains 1 / 2 were compared to the monomer fold of the representative ATP - binding USP, MJ0577 ( PDBID 1MJH) [ 26].

To explore the relationship between the putative ATP - dependent biochemical function of Rv2623 and the growth - regulating attribute of Rv2623, we engineered mutations within the L1 ( D15E) and beta4 ( G117A) conserved residues that were predicted, on the basis of the crystal structure, to disrupt ATP recognition ( Figure 7A).	"Rv2623	89	95	Protein"	"Rv2623	137	143	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rv2623"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Rv2623"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Results of these studies demonstrated that while overexpression of wildtype Rv2623 retards the growth of the recipient strain relative to cells transformed with vector alone, growth of the strains overexpressing ATP - binding - deficient mutant Rv2623 are only minimally affected by overexpression as assessed by spotting serial dilutions of the cultures of the appropriate strains onto solid Middlebrook 7H10 agar ( data not shown) as well as by monitoring the time to detection using the BD BACTEC 9000MB system ( Figure 8A).

These genes, referred to as the dormancy regulon, are transcriptionally regulated by the mycobacterial two - component system DosR - DosS under hypoxic conditions [ 4].

"Intriguingly, ectopic overexpression of HspX by the same means employed by our study also resulted in an attenuated growth phenotype compared with LacZ - overexpressing controls [ 44], suggesting that these two tightly co - regulated "" stress "" proteins might have similar growth - regulatory roles during dormancy."

A structural comparison between the prototypic members of the two subclasses, the non - ATP - binding UspA homolog ( H. influenzae, PDB ID 1JMV) and the ATP - binding USP, MJ0577 ( M. jannaschii, PDB ID 1MJH) revealed that while both proteins exhibit a similar fold, conserved glycine residues within the ATP - binding loop of the latter are substituted with bulky amino acids that preclude ATP recognition in the former [ 26], [ 27].

Furthermore, given that the attenuated growth phenotype caused by overexpression of Rv2623 could be abrogated by mutations that interfere with the binding of this protein to its nucleotide substrate, it is likely that the mycobacterial growth - regulatory faculty of Rv2623 is mediated by an ATP - dependent function.

In summary, the results of the present study have revealed that the M. tuberculosis USP Rv2623 has the ability to regulate mycobacterial growth, as evident by the in vivo hypervirulence phenotype of Deltarv2623, which fails to establish a persistent infection in susceptible hosts, as well as the growth attenuation observed in mycobacteria overexpressing this USP.

The fact that E. coli - expressed Rv2623 co - purifies with ADP as well as ATP suggests the possibility that this mycobacterial USP, like MJ0577, is capable of ATP hydrolysis.

Recent identification of the DosR - dependent dormancy regulon [ 3], [ 4], [ 5]; the DosR - independent enduring hypoxic response, which involves over 200 mycobacterial genes, including those known to regulate bacteriostasis [ 42]; and the demonstration that M. tuberculosis redox and hypoxia sensors can interact with multiple ligands that differentially modulate the activity of these important kinases [ 28], [ 29], [ 30], [ 31], [ 32], predict a complex regulatory network for tuberculous latency.

Further, we demonstrate the interdependency of this two - component systems network with GacS ( PA0928), which was found to play a dual role in biofilm formation.

Both are involved in the reciprocal cyclic - di - GMP - dependent regulation of Pel and Psl exopolysaccharide production as P. aeruginosa transitions from a planktonic to a surface associated lifestyle.

Both Pel and Psl exopolysaccharides contribute to the overall architecture of biofilms and are essential for surface interaction and biofilm initiation [ 34], [ 35].

This multi - component switch thus orchestrates the transition from the planktonic to the biofilm mode of growth by P. aeruginosa via phosphorylation events of the two - component regulatory system GacA / GacS [ 36] - [ 38].

In contrast, PA4197 and PA4101 mutant biofilms lacked microcolonies after 144 hr of growth ( Fig. 2B) and were only composed of a thin layer of cells at the substratum with an average height of 0. 5 and 1. 4 microm, respectively ( Table 2).

However, in contrast to PA4197 mutant biofilms, PA4101 mutant biofilms demonstrated the formation of some cellular aggregates which were less than 10 microm in height ( Fig. 2B).

Complementation of both PA4101 and PA4197 mutants restored biofilm formation to wild type levels ( Fig. 2C, Table 2).

These results allowed us to firmly conclude that the mutant biofilm phenotypes are caused by a defect in the PA4197 and PA4101 ORF.

The cognate sensor BfmS ( PA4102) is unusual in that it lacks an autophosphorylation site typically found in sensor kinases [ 53].

Furthermore, no difference in growth in broth or defect with respect to twitching, swimming, and swarming or Pel and Psl polysaccharide production was detected for any of the mutant strains ( not shown).

To determine the stage at which DeltabfiS and DeltabfmR mutant biofilms were arrested, the biofilm architecture of the mutant strains after 144 hr of growth was compared to the wild type P. aeruginosa biofilm architecture following 24, 72, and 144 hr of growth ( Table 2).

Based on the comparison of 5 biofilm variables, both mutant biofilms were more similar to 24 - hr - old biofilms, with DeltabfmR forming more substantial biofilms than DeltabfiS or 24 hr wild type biofilms ( Table 2).

Arrest of biofilm formation at the 1 - day time point correlated with the timing of BfiS and BfmR phosphorylation ( Tables 1 - 2).

Comparison of the DeltamifR biofilm architecture following 144 hr of growth to wild type biofilms indicated that DeltamifR biofilms were comparable to 72 - hr - old biofilms.

Since MifR was detected to be phosphorylated following 72 hr of biofilm growth ( Table 1), our findings indicate that phosphorylation of MifR is essential for the progression of P. aeruginosa biofilms from the maturation - 1 stage ( 72 hr) to the maturation - 2 stage ( 144 hr).

The DeltabfiS and DeltabfmR biofilms resembled wild type biofilms with respect to biomass and overall architecture at the 24 hr time point ( see Fig. 2A - B).

However, while wild type biofilms continued to mature / develop upon prolonged incubation ( see Fig. 2A), no additional biomass accumulation or alteration in architecture was observed for DeltabfiS and DeltabfmR biofilms post 24 hr of growth.

These findings suggest that GacS may play a dual role in regulating biofilm formation, which in turn may be dependent on the phosphorylation status of GacS ( Table 1).

The phosphoproteome of DeltabfiS biofilms as determined by LC - MS / MS was 74% similar ( 26% difference) to planktonic cells while DeltabfmR biofilms shared 60% of all detected phosphorylation events with planktonic cells ( 40% difference).

For instance, DeltabfiS and DeltabfmR biofilms lacked all phosphorylated proteins typically found in mature, 144 - hr - old biofilms.

In contrast, DeltabfmR biofilms were most similar to protein patterns obtained from 72 - hr - old wild type biofilms ( 85% similarity), while those of DeltamifR biofilms were similar to both 72 - and 144 - hr - old biofilms sharing 76 and 82% similarity, respectively, to both protein patterns ( Fig. 4B).

Inactivation of MifR appeared to result in the arrest of biofilm development in the transition between the maturation - 1 and - 2 stages ( 72 to 144 hr) while DeltabfmR biofilms were arrested in the transition between irreversible attachment to maturation - 1 stage.

For DeltabfiS and DeltabfmR mutant biofilms, biofilm disaggregation was noticeable as early as 24 hr post arabinose removal ( not shown).

This family of regulators control transcription from - 12, - 24 promoters recognized by RNA polymerase that utilizes the alternative sigma 54 factor encoded by rpoN and its analogs.

Based on domain structure, two TCS regulatory proteins identified here regulate genes controlled by the sigma factors RpoD and RpoN [ 53], [ 74], [ 75].

The only other regulatory system having been identified to play a role at later stages of biofilm formation, in particular the formation of large microcolonies and fluid - filled channels, is the three - component system SadARS ( RocS1RA1), probably by controlling the expression of fimbrial cup genes [ 66], [ 76].

Crystallographic analysis of SrcA at a resolution of 2. 5 A revealed a dimer similar to the CesT chaperone from enteropathogenic E. coli but lacking a 17 - amino acid extension at the carboxyl terminus.

Secondary structure predictions suggest class III chaperones adopt an extended alpha helical structure, which was confirmed by the crystal structure of the CesA chaperone in enteropathogenic E. coli that binds the EspA filament protein [ 5].

These cues activate a two - component signaling system encoded in the SPI - 2 island comprising the SsrA sensor kinase and SsrB response regulator.

We solved the crystal structure of SrcA and performed additional biochemical, proteomic and in vivo experiments that revealed SrcA to be a class I chaperone required for bacterial fitness in the host environment.

To determine whether SrcA contributes to Salmonella fitness in a host, we created an unmarked in - frame srcA deletion in S.

The level of attenuation of the srcA mutant was generally higher than most single effector gene mutants [ 26], which suggested to us that SrcA contributes to an important aspect of T3SS function in vivo.

Sequence analysis showed 59% amino acid identity between SrcA and CesT, a secretion chaperone in enteropathogenic E. coli ( EPEC) ( Fig. 2A).

As a means to address the biological function of SrcA, we solved the crystal structure at 2. 5 - A resolution ( PDB 3EPU).	"SrcA	49	53	Protein"	"PDB 3EPU	112	120	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SrcA"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PDB 3EPU"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The structure was solved by molecular replacement using an initial model based on CesT ( PDB 1K3E) [ 13].

With the exception of CesT, SrcA has weak overall sequence identity ( < 20%) with other T3SS chaperones.

In CesT, alpha1 and beta1 adopt an extended conformation while the equivalent domain in SicP remains closely packed against the dimerization domain [ 12].

This is in contrast to the class II chaperone interface of Spa15, which despite having similar tertiary structure to SrcA adopts a distinct dimer interface.

To address this biochemically we purified SrcA and the predicted ATPase for the SPI - 2 T3SS, SsaN, and performed binding experiments and gel filtration chromatography of the protein mixtures.	"SrcA	42	46	Protein"	"SsaN	94	98	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SrcA"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SsaN"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We then mixed SrcA and SsaN proteins and resolved the protein complexes by gel filtration chromatography.

We verified the identities of protein originating from each peak by western blot ( Fig. 4D) and LC - MS / MS, which showed the new complex was comprised of both SsaN and SrcA.

Since structural and biochemical data unambiguously defined SrcA as a T3SS - associated chaperone, we used two experimental approaches to identify SrcA cargo ( s).

For this series of experiments we constructed a mutant in which the srcA gene was replaced on the chromosome with srcA - FLAG to enable immunoprecipitation from cell lysates.

In these experiments the T3SS effector protein SseL was identified by quantitative SILAC mass spectrometry as a specific SrcA cargo protein ( Fig. 5B).

As expected from data with the complemented mutant in vivo, expression of srcA in trans restored effector secretion in the srcA mutant ( data not shown).

SrcA is required for PipB2 - dependent centrifugal displacement of the Salmonella - containing vacuole	"SrcA	0	4	Protein"	"PipB2	21	26	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SrcA"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PipB2"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
By 24 h after infection SCVs containing wild type bacteria were displaced centrifugally towards the cell periphery whereas SCVs containing either pipB2 or srcA mutant bacteria remained juxtaposed to the nucleus ( Fig. 6A).

Interestingly, SrcA lacks 17 - amino acids that make up the carboxyl terminus of CesT, which includes Glu142, and yet it still retains effector binding, ATPase binding and effector secretion functionalities.

The interface for the SrcA homodimer is extensive and is more in keeping with the structural features of single - effector class IA chaperones ( approximately1100 - 1300 A2) compared to the reduced dimer interface of Spa15, a multi - cargo class IB chaperone from Shigella [ 31].

We found no evidence of interactions between SrcA and translocon components of the SPI - 2 T3SS and so it appears as though SrcA functions specifically in effector translocation events.

The interaction between SrcA and SsaN supports an emerging paradigm whereby secretion chaperones bring effector cargo to the T3SS through physical interaction with the hexameric ATPase at the base of the apparatus [ 14].

Due to low G + C base content compared to the genome average of 52%, it ' s likely that srcA ( 32% G + C) and an adjacent gene, STM2137 ( 37% G + C), were acquired as a foreign islet that was retained in organisms containing the SPI - 2 T3SS due to the selective advantage afforded by the new protein interactions so created.

The gabD and gabT genes involved in the production of succinate from gamma - aminobutyrate ( GABA), another member of the L - glutamate group, were also highly induced in the flea.

Alternatively, the gabD and gabT gene products might act in the reverse direction to synthesize GABA, which has osmoprotective properties [ 13].

Upregulation of the actP and acs genes in the flea, which direct the uptake of acetate and its conversion to acetyl - CoA, also suggests that insufficient acetyl - CoA is produced by glycolysis to potentiate the TCA cycle.

Other virulence and transmission factors were not differentially regulated, including the hms genes; and the Y. pestis plasminogen activator ( pla), critical for dissemination from extravascular tissue at the fleabite site [ 33], and ymt were highly expressed in both hosts ( Table S3 and [ 11]).

PhoP and MgtC are established virulence factors known to be important for survival of Y. pestis and other gram - negative bacteria in macrophages and for resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides ( CAMPs) of the mammalian innate immune response [ 38], [ 39], [ 40].

Because phoP is required by Y. pestis to produce a transmissible infection in fleas ( unpublished data), it was not possible to similarly assess the effect on disease transmission of phoP induction in the flea.

In addition, although the antiphagocytic F1 capsule and Psa fimbriae do not appear to be produced in the flea, upregulation in the flea of most F1 genes in the cafRcaf1M1A1 locus and the Psa usher protein gene psaC ( Tables 1, S1) suggests that components of the F1 and Psa translocation system are made, which may prime Y. pestis for rapid secretion of these extracellular virulence factors after transmission.

Although genome sequencing has revealed 21 putative two - component regulatory systems in the Brucella genus, the best characterized one implicated in virulence is the BvrR / BvrS system.

BvrR / bvrS mutants are avirulent in mice, have increased susceptibility to killing by nonimmune serum, show reduced invasiveness to epithelial cells and macrophages, and are incapable of inhibiting lysosome fusion and of intracellular replication [ 4].

As demonstrated for other two - component systems, multiple genes are expected to be under the control of BvrR / BvrS [ 1].

To further understand the role of the BvrR / BvrS two - component signal transduction system, global gene expression profiles were analyzed by using ORFeome - based Brucella whole - genome DNA microarrays and confirmed by reverse transcription - PCR ( RT - PCR).

Whole - genome microarray analysis was made to determine the effect of the mutation in BvrR / BvrS in the gene expression pattern of Brucella.

These observations led to the hypothesis that the BvrR / BvrS system is involved in cell envelope changes required for adaptation to the intracellular environment.

These data confirm that BvrR / BvrS regulates bacterial envelope changes that could modify surface properties relevant for Brucella virulence [ 6].

In addition, the complete maltose transport system of Brucella, which consists in a large operon containing thirteen genes ( BAB1 _ 0236 - 0248) was also affected.

On the other hand, two deaminases ( glutaminase, BAB2 _ 0863; guanine deaminase, BAB1 _ 0383) were also affected.

Taken together all these data support the proposal that one role of the BvrR / BvrS system could be neutralize the production of toxic reactive nitrogen molecules, as NO, by the host.

Comparative genome analysis revealed that in addition to the bvrR / bvrS genes, the genome structure around these genes is essentially the same for all the alpha - proteobacteria [ 5].

Genes encoding proteins related to the PTS, including a HPr Ser - kinase, an EIIA permease of the mannose family and a HPr homologue precede those of the two - component regulatory system.

Moreover, a systematically transcriptome analysis of all two component regulatory systems in E. coli has demonstrated that the OmpR / EnvZ system also controls the metabolism of amino acids, flagellar synthesis and nutrient transport [ 24].

In addition, the transcription of the S. meliloti lpsS gene, that encodes a sulfotransferase that modifies LPS, is dependent on the exoR gene [ 32].

Most of the genes candidate to be regulated by BvrR / BvrS identified in our microarray experiments can be involved with the changes needed for intracellular survival of Brucella.

In order to investigate if the BvrR / BvrS controlled genes were expressed intracellularly, bacterial RNA was obtained from B. abortus wild type recovered from infected cells as described in Material and Methods.

In conclusion, all these results and previous findings support the proposal that BvrR / BvrS controls a significantly broad set of phenotypes and define an important and coordinate gateway between the free - living and intracellular states of Brucella.

But the inclusion of SeMac in the assay did not affect opsonophagocytosis of S. equi ( Fig. 5A), suggesting that SeMac does not inhibit opsonophagocytosis of S. equi by horse PMNs.

The inability of SeMac to inhibit S. equi opsonophagocytosis by horse PMNs may be due to its inability to cleave the majority of horse IgG.
