It is interesting to note that this region contains: a putative adhesin protein gene ( OG1RF _ 0039) at one end of the fragment; homologues of 14 Tn916 - associated genes ( Tn916 _ 2 to Tn916 _ 12, Tn916 _ 18 and Tn916 _ 19, with an average of 70% similarity); and a gene encoding a putative integrase ( OG1RF _ 0088) at the other end - these three features are also present in Tn5386 in E. faecium D344R [ 46].
