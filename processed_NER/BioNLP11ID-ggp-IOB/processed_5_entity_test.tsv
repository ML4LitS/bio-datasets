Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Drosophila Imd - regulated local gut response is necessary to combat infection and that P. entomophila AprA - regulation via GacS / GacA and PrtR regulators is used as a strategy to escape AMP activity.

The structural gene for the metalloprotease, aprA, is followed by a gene encoding its periplasmic inhibitor, aprI, and three genes encoding the Type I transporter, aprD, E, and F ( Figure 2A).

We could not exclude that the aprA mutant phenotype was due to polar effects of the insertion in the operon upon expression of apr I, D, E, and F.

To determine whether AprA plays a role in counteracting the Imd - dependent immune response, we compared persistence of wild - type P. entomophila, gacA, and aprA derivatives by quantifying the number of bacteria in Rel flies and larvae.	"AprA	21	25	Protein"	"Imd	60	63	Protein"	"gacA	148	152	Protein"	"aprA	158	162	Protein"	"Rel	216	219	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 158, ""end_span"": 162, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Rel"", ""start_span"": 216, ""end_span"": 219, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We utilized an engineered fly line ( UAS - imd, hs - Gal4) over - expressing imd under the control of a heat - shock promoter via the UAS - Gal4 system, which consequently leads to strong expression of Imd - dependent AMP genes.	"imd	43	46	Protein"	"Gal4	53	57	Protein"	"imd	77	80	Protein"	"Gal4	140	144	Protein"	"Imd	202	205	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""imd"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Gal4"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""imd"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Gal4"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 202, ""end_span"": 205, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This conclusion is based on our observations that ( i) aprA mutants show attenuated virulence, ( ii) aprA mutants survive less well than wild - type P. entomophila in Drosophila and are more sensitive to Imd - mediated defense, and ( iii) AprA provides specific protection in vivo against Diptericin.

As opposed to the pleiotropic effects of GacS / GacA, PrtR appears to be a more specific regulator of aprA expression in P. entomophila, reminiscent of aprX regulation in P. fluorescens [ 32].

This observation is consistent with the dual functional role of RcsC as both kinase and phosphatase, moving phosphates both to and away from RcsB via RcsD, and that RcsB remains phosphorylated in rcsC null mutants [ 38, 39].

Tether assays with DeltayhjH DeltacheZ double mutants showed flagellar rotation indistinguishable from cheZ single mutants ( unpublished data), indicating that null mutations in cheZ are epistatic to null mutations in yhjH.

YfiR is predicted to be a periplasmic protein, YfiB shows sequence similarity to outer - membrane porin proteins, and YfiN is a predicted inner - membrane protein with GGDEF and HAMP domains.

The selection results revealed that mutants harboring insertions in five genes ( ompR, envZ, znuA, znuC, and yfiM) were the most abundant.

Overall Hfq has a much stronger global effect on Salmonella protein translation than SmpB which is in agreement with the large number of regulatory sRNAs that serve as guides for Hfq translational modulation as opposed to the single regulatory sRNA ( i. e. tmRNA) that requires SmpB for activity.

These transcriptional profiling data, combined with previous comparative genomic hybridizations performed by our group, revealed that 66 out of the 72 up - regulated genes are conserved amongst all serotypes and that 3 of them code for products that are predicted outer membrane proteins ( genes irp and APL _ 0959, predicted to code for a TonB - dependent receptor and a filamentous hemagglutinin / adhesin respectively) or lipoproteins ( gene APL _ 0920).

The study by Sheehan et al [ 16], lead to the identification of a second set of exbB - exbD - tonB genes, and it was determined that inactivation of tonB2 and not tonB1 lead to attenuation in vivo [ 17].

Of the last five genes, four are divergent in only one strain ( hktE, fur, phoR and hisH, respectively in reference strains from serotypes 8, 2, 15 and 7), and the APL _ 0999 gene codes for a hypothetical protein that is divergent in serotype 2, 7 - 11 and 14 reference strains.

These three genes, namely fhaB ( APL _ 0959), irp ( APL _ 0919) and APL _ 0920, could all represent excellent candidates for the development of a protective cross - serotype subunit vaccine against A. pleuropneumoniae.

Several ancestral regulators control the genes in the SPI - 2 genomic island including the two - component systems EnvZ - OmpR and PhoQ - PhoP, and the regulatory protein SlyA [ 13].

In control screens with the PhoP - alphaNTD fusion, the PhoP box sequence ( G / T) GTTTA was identified in 11% of sequenced preys ( 12 / 109, data not shown) but this sequence was never captured by SsrB - alphaNTD and vice versa, demonstrating specificity of the bacterial one - hybrid system for prokaryotic regulatory proteins.

Remarkably, this accounted for 17 of 22 SL1344 genome - encoded effectors translocated by the SPI - 2 - encoded T3SS ( exceptions are chromosomal steA, gogB, and sseK, and plasmid - encoded spvB and spvC).

Our ChIP - on - chip data revealed three additional strong SsrB binding peaks within SPI - 2: one in the IGR directly upstream of ssaR, a second within the CDS for ssaJ, and a third within the CDS for ssaE that would be predicted to influence transcription of the downstream effector / chaperone operon beginning with sseA.

Moreover, we identified a unique cluster, CC7, that includes genes upregulated both in vivo and as a consequence of the covS mutation ( e. g., those encoding M protein, streptolysin O, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide glycohydrolase ( NADGH), Fig. 2, CC7).

While the expression patterns in clusters CC4, CC5, CC8, and CC9 match the previously described in vitro differences between WT and AP strains [ 10], [ 12], [ 13], [ 26], [ 27] ( e. g., downregulation of SpeB, CAMP, and EndoS genes; upregulation of SpeA, SIC, and capsule genes), the combined comparative analysis of in vitro and in vivo samples revealed novel expression patterns exemplified by CC6 and CC10.

The downregulation of GRAB makes biological sense because this protein binds alpha - 2 - macroglobulin in blood [ 60] to protect the bacteria against its own protease, SpeB, and thus the bacteria no longer need to express high levels of GRAB when SpeB is not expressed.

Methodology / Principal Findings In this study, the sak188 and sak189 genes were inactivated, and the functional role of Sak188 / Sak189 two - component system in regulation of the beta - antigen expression was investigated.

Given that insertional inactivation of RR gene results in inactivation of HK gene [ 22] which are co - transcribed ( Fig. 1), the strain with insertionally inactivated sak189 gene can be considered as sak189 / sak188 double mutant strain, while the strain with insertionally inactivated sak188 gene - as sak188 mutant strain.	"sak189	168	174	Protein"	"sak189	201	207	Protein"	"sak188	210	216	Protein"	"sak188	287	293	Protein"	"sak188	304	310	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""sak189"", ""start_span"": 168, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak189"", ""start_span"": 201, ""end_span"": 207, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak188"", ""start_span"": 210, ""end_span"": 216, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak188"", ""start_span"": 287, ""end_span"": 293, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak188"", ""start_span"": 304, ""end_span"": 310, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Theoretically, in both sak188 mutant strain and sak189 / sak188 double mutant strain, the Sak188 / Sak189 TCS can be inactive.

Thus, we can conclude that sak188 and bac gene are not in the operon, and repression of bac gene transcription in sak189 / sak188 double mutant strain is not due to the polar effect.
