SpeB ( encoded by spy2039) is a multifunctional cysteine protease implicated in numerous infection strategies [ 28, 29].

Although the delineation of genes influenced by RopB ( or any identified transcriptional regulator) is beyond the scope of this study, our initial analysis did identify the upregulation of a two - component regulatory system, encoded by spy1236 - 1237.	"RopB	48	52	Protein"	"spy1236	237	244	Protein"	"1237	247	251	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RopB"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""spy1236"", ""start_span"": 237, ""end_span"": 244, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""1237"", ""start_span"": 247, ""end_span"": 251, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
For example, the nine - gene operon that spans genes spy0738 - 0746 encodes streptolysin S, a potent cytolytic toxin that promotes internalization and host tissue dissemination [ 25, 44].

Furthermore, the spy0128 - encoded protein is the structural backbone of the pili, and the gene product of spy0130 may be involved in stabilizing the structure [ 36].	"spy0128	17	24	Protein"	"gene product	91	103	Protein"	"spy0130	107	114	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""spy0128"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""gene product"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""spy0130"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Although operon - modeling methods exist [ 54, 55], we inspected clusters in silico for upstream regulatory elements and identified 17 candidates, including clusters such as streptolysin S that have been previously confirmed as operons [ 56]; the spy0127 - 0130 grouping, which was confirmed as an operon in this study; and others that have yet to be verified ( Table S6).

Expression of the fimA gene is tightly controlled by a two - component system ( FimS / FimR) through a cascade regulation.	"fimA	18	22	Protein"	"FimS	80	84	Protein"	"FimR	87	91	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""fimA"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FimS"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FimR"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To investigate effects of FimR on expression of the mfa1 gene, an insertional fimR mutant was constructed by allelic replacement.	"FimR	26	30	Protein"	"mfa1	52	56	Protein"	"fimR	78	82	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FimR"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mfa1"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fimR"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Expression of fimA and mfa1 in the fimR - mutant was determined using real - time PCR analysis.	"fimA	14	18	Protein"	"mfa1	23	27	Protein"	"fimR	35	39	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""fimA"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mfa1"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fimR"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The striking finding is that expression of the mfa1 gene was also repressed threefold in the fimR - mutant, although not to the degree observed with the fimA expression.	"mfa1	47	51	Protein"	"fimR	93	97	Protein"	"fimA	153	157	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""mfa1"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fimR"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fimA"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, the fimR - mutation had no effect on expression of rgpA, a gene encoding the arginine - specific protease, or the P. gingivalis 16S RNA gene.	"fimR	13	17	Protein"	"rgpA	60	64	Protein"	"16S RNA	137	144	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""fimR"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""rgpA"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""16S RNA"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This analysis suggests the FimS / FimR system is required for expression of both major and minor fimbriae.	"FimS	27	31	Protein"	"FimR	34	38	Protein"	"minor fimbriae	91	105	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FimS"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FimR"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""minor fimbriae"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Similarly, there was no apparent change in RgpA production in the fimR - mutant, which was detected by anti - RgpA serum.	"RgpA	43	47	Protein"	"fimR	66	70	Protein"	"RgpA	110	114	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RgpA"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fimR"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RgpA"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
One possibility is that FimR modulates mfa1 expression by directly binding to the promoter region of mfa1.	"FimR	24	28	Protein"	"mfa1	39	43	Protein"	"mfa1	101	105	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FimR"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mfa1"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mfa1"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The mfa1 promoter ( positioned from + 18 to - 138), fimA promoter ( positioned from - 22 to - 190) ( Xie & Lamont, 1999) and mfa1 coding DNA ( positioned from + 1253 to + 1373) were generated by PCR with the 5 ' biotin - labeled primers ( Table 1).	"mfa1	4	8	Protein"	"fimA	52	56	Protein"	"mfa1	125	129	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""mfa1"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fimA"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mfa1"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Retarded mfa1 promoter - rFimR complex was detected with as little as 10 pmol muL - 1 rFimR ( Fig. 3).	"mfa1	9	13	Protein"	"rFimR	25	30	Protein"	"rFimR	86	91	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""mfa1"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""rFimR"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""rFimR"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The unlabeled mfa1 promoter fragments effectively competed with the labeled fragment, suggesting a specific interaction between rFimA and the mfa1 promoter.	"mfa1	14	18	Protein"	"rFimA	128	133	Protein"	"mfa1	142	146	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""mfa1"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""rFimA"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mfa1"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To investigate the role of phosphorylation of FimR in its binding to the mfa1 promoter region, EMSA experiments were also performed with the phosphorylated rFimR.	"FimR	46	50	Protein"	"mfa1	73	77	Protein"	"rFimR	156	161	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FimR"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mfa1"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""rFimR"", ""start_span"": 156, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These data clearly show that FimR protein can bind specifically to the mfa1 promoter region, acting as an activator of mfa1 transcription.	"FimR	29	33	Protein"	"mfa1	71	75	Protein"	"mfa1	119	123	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FimR"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mfa1"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mfa1"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The biotin - labeled DNA fragment corresponding to this promoter region did not shift in the presence of the rFimA protein ( data not shown), suggesting that only the promoter identified here is involved for mfa1 expression mediated by FimR.	"rFimA	109	114	Protein"	"mfa1	208	212	Protein"	"FimR	236	240	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""rFimA"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mfa1"", ""start_span"": 208, ""end_span"": 212, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FimR"", ""start_span"": 236, ""end_span"": 240, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Although most target genes of P. gingivalis two - component systems are unknown, the role of the FimS / FimR in expression of the fimA gene is well defined.	"FimS	97	101	Protein"	"FimR	104	108	Protein"	"fimA	130	134	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FimS"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FimR"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fimA"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Expression of minor fimbriae ( mfa1) in a fimR mutanthas been investigated.	"minor fimbriae	14	28	Protein"	"mfa1	31	35	Protein"	"fimR	42	46	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""minor fimbriae"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mfa1"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fimR"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It has also been reported previously that the transcriptional activity of fimA was reduced in the fimA mutant, indicating multiple levels of control of fimA expression in P. gingivalis ( Xie et al., 2000a).	"fimA	74	78	Protein"	"fimA	98	102	Protein"	"fimA	152	156	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""fimA"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fimA"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fimA"", ""start_span"": 152, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The observations that FimR binds only to the upstream promoter region of the mfa1 gene and that activity of the downstream promoter is inhibited by S. gordonii, S. sanguinis and S. mitis ( Park et al., 2006) imply the complexity of regulation of mfa1 expression.	"FimR	22	26	Protein"	"mfa1	77	81	Protein"	"mfa1	246	250	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FimR"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mfa1"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mfa1"", ""start_span"": 246, ""end_span"": 250, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
By this approach we obtained appropriately complemented transformants for the SNPs in genes fadE5, rpsL, and phoP ( Table S1), using cosmids I230, I563, and I36, respectively.	"fadE5	92	97	Protein"	"rpsL	99	103	Protein"	"phoP	109	113	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""fadE5"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""rpsL"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Whereas H37Ra:: fadE5 ( Figure 1) and H37Ra:: rpsL ( unpublished data) showed very little or no growth over the 7 - d period, the H37Ra:: phoP mutant grew more vigorously, with a 7. 5 - fold increase in colony - forming units ( CFU) over the 7 - d period.	"fadE5	16	21	Protein"	"rpsL	46	50	Protein"	"phoP	138	142	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""fadE5"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""rpsL"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Groups of C57BL / 6 mice were subcutaneously inoculated with H37Rv, H37Ra, or one of three recombinant H37Ra strains complemented with phoP, fadE5, or rpsL, respectively.	"phoP	135	139	Protein"	"fadE5	141	146	Protein"	"rpsL	151	155	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fadE5"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""rpsL"", ""start_span"": 151, ""end_span"": 155, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, in H37Ra the presence of this cosmid could not increase the weak ESAT - 6 and CFP - 10 T cell responses ( Figure 3B) in the splenocyte IFN - gamma assay.	"ESAT - 6	74	82	Protein"	"CFP - 10	87	95	Protein"	"IFN - gamma	144	155	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CFP - 10"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IFN - gamma"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 155, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Altogether, our data obtained from multiple replicate experiments indicate that a direct link exists between a fully functional PhoP and the ability to generate T cell responses against ESAT - 6 and CFP - 10.	"PhoP	128	132	Protein"	"ESAT - 6	186	194	Protein"	"CFP - 10	199	207	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PhoP"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 186, ""end_span"": 194, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CFP - 10"", ""start_span"": 199, ""end_span"": 207, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The identification of the amino acid change S219L in the predicted DNA binding region of the C - terminal effector domain of PhoP [ 15, 22] in H37Ra was therefore a particularly exciting finding that has the potential to explain part of the attenuation of the H37Ra strain and to elucidate the PhoP / PhoR associated complex regulatory network in M. tuberculosis.

Closer inspection of the data published in the corresponding supplemental materials showed that rv3612c - rv3616c were strongly downregulated in the H37Rv phoP ko mutant as well as in H37Ra [ 12, 21].	"rv3612c	96	103	Protein"	"rv3616c	106	113	Protein"	"phoP	155	159	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""rv3612c"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""rv3616c"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 159, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These transcriptome data corroborate our results obtained by quantitative RT - PCR using probe rv3614c, which showed that gene rv3614c was definitely expressed much lower in H37Ra than in H37Rv and H37Ra:: phoP strains ( Figure 6).

However, upregulation of phoP and rv3614c - rv3616c was observed after incubation of M. tuberculosis in 5mM H2O2 [ 37].

Regulation by AHL - LuxR - like receptors Virulence, bioluminescence, mutualism, antibiotic production and biofilm formation are often regulated by LuxI / LuxR quorum sensing systems in Gram - negative bacteria.

One of them is autoinductor 2 ( AI - 2), furanosyl borate diester, which is synthesized by the luxS product [ 39, 40] of which homologues are present in P. luminescens and Y. enterocolitica ( plu1253, ye0839).

The methoprene - tolerant gene ( met, also called Resistance to Juvenile Hormone Rst1JH) of D. melanogaster encodes a helix - loop - helix transcriptional regulator combined with a PAS _ 3 domain [ 45].

Homologues of these proteins are also present in P. aeruginosa, namely PA4352 and PA3309, a tandem - type Usp protein and a UspA - like protein, respectively.

In P. luminescens, expression of UspA has been shown to be under control of the AstS / AstR TCS, which is important for the correct timing of phase variant switching [ 28].

Because Y. enterocolitica produces the corresponding TCS BvgS / BvgR, but is not known to switch to another phenotypic variant, the possible role of UspA in global regulation still remains to be elucidated.

In Y. enterocolitica, the transcriptional repressor RovM ( YE1343) is similar to HexA of P. luminescens ( 61% identity and 75% homology), and has only recently been shown to control cell invasion, virulence and motility in Y. pseudotuberculosis, Y. pestis and Y. enterocolitica [ 51 - 53].

A GroEL homologue is present in P. luminescens ( Plu4134) which the P. luminescens UspG homologues might interact with.

In contrast to P. luminescens, Y. enterocolitica encodes another member of the UspA subfamily, the UspC homologue YE2583 ( Tab. 2), which is not present in P. luminescens.

The UspA and the UspE homologues are predicted here to be relevant for insect infection, whereas UspC is assumed be more important for Y. enterocolitica in other environments / hosts.

The PilZ domain is found as a stand - alone domain or in combination with GGDEF, EAL and other domains, thus assumed to function also as an allosteric domain to control other regulatory enzymes [ 58, 59].

Although it can not be excluded that the hemolysins of Y. enterocolitica act on the immune systems of both the insect and the mammalian host, the genetic overlap of this group of virulence factor between both pathogens, and the low - temperature expression of YE0479 / YE0480 and fhaC, indicates the presence of insect - specific hemolysins in the genome of Y. enterocolitica.

In addition, neither the crystal proteins encoded by cipA and cipB in P. luminescens nor a Bt - like toxin ( plu1537) could be found in Y. enterocolitica.

Remarkably, yplA is induced at low temperature ( Table 1), and its expression is known to be regulated by the master regulator FlhDC [ 94], indicating that YplA plays a role in pathogenicity both against human and insect hosts.

Among them is PrtA ( Plu0655 / YE4052), a zinc metalloprotease that is involved in the immunosuppressive activity of X. nematophila [ 96], and that has also been shown to be involved in insect gut colonization of P. luminescens [ 97].

Moreover, several genes induced at lower temperature such as inv, yst or yplA affect the virulence properties of Y. enterocolitica in mice [ 87].

Dissecting the genomes of Y. enterocolitica and P. luminescens for putative key regulators, we identified factor groups ( AI - 2, PAS - 4 / LuxR like receptors) possibly involved in pathogen - insect association only, those with members contributing to either insect or mammalian pathogenicity ( QS, TKS, Usp), and c - di - GMP signalling probably not involved in regulation of activities against insects.

Results To determine the impact of the GraRS regulatory system on resistance to antimicrobial host defense mechanisms and virulence of S. aureus, we compared inactivation of S. aureus SA113 wild type and its isogenic graRS deletion mutant by the human cathelicidin LL - 37 or human neutrophil granulocytes in vitro, and the ability to cause infection in vivo.

Deletion of the graRS genes in the dlt mutant background did not lead to further increased binding of cytochrome c compared to the dltA mutant ( Fig. 1B).

This finding indicates that the increased binding of cytochrome c by the graRS mutant is due to decreased alanylation of teichoic acids and that the resulting surface charge alteration does not result from other regulatory effects mediated by GraRS.

The amounts of LPG from WT and graRS mutant were indistinguishable ( data not shown), which corroborates recent findings that mprF is not among the graRS - regulated genes in S. aureus SA113 [ 10].

However, GAS which lack either SLO or ScpC exhibit much less mortality than the csrS - mutated parent invasive GAS isolate to the infected mice.

The strains of emm1 genotype, among more than 100 emm genes encoding the serotype - determinant M protein, are the predominant cause of severe GAS infections in Japan [ 7].

Furthermore, an SLO deficient mutant from a STSS isolate NIH230 ( NIH230slo) lost the killing activity for PMN ( Figure 3A), thereby, strongly suggesting that SLO is a key element for PMN killing mediated by invasive GAS.

Contrarily, SLS - deficient mutant from NIH230 strain ( NIH230sagA) killed PMN, as efficiently as did parent strain, indicating that SLS is dispensable for killing of PMN mediated by invasive GAS.

Although NIH230slo lost the killing activity for PMN, migration of PMN in response to IL - 8 in a transwell system was not restored in the presence of this mutant ( Figure 4A), thereby, suggesting that severe invasive GAS blocks PMN migration by influence on IL - 8 activity.

The results showed that NIH230scpC neither digested IL - 8, like 1566 strain, ( Figure 4B) nor abrogated the migration of PMN in response to IL - 8, comparable to 1566 strain ( Figure 4A), whereas the mutant killed the migrated PMN as well as the parent strain NIH230 ( data not shown).

Enhanced expression of the slo and the scpC genes in severe invasive GAS is attributed to mutation of a transcriptional regulator CsrS	"slo	27	30	Protein"	"scpC	39	43	Protein"	"CsrS	130	134	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""slo"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""scpC"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CsrS"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
GAS isolates from mice with severe invasive disease had mutations in csrS, raising the notion that CsrR / S function is important in modulating gene expression during infection.	"csrS	69	73	Protein"	"CsrR	99	103	Protein"	"S	106	107	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""csrS"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CsrR"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""S"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, we analyzed the linkage between the csrS and / or csrR genes and the property of invasive GAS infection by sequencing these genes in the emm49 strains used in this study.

The csrS - introduced severe invasive GAS reduced the expression levels of the slo and the scpC genes, comparable to those detected in the non - invasive GAS.

Subcutaneous inoculation of NIH230scpC and NIH230slo yielded the local infected lesions with area comparable to those of 1566 and NIH230:: csrS + during the course of infection ( Figure 7D).

The csrS mutations enhanced the expression of scpC and slo, associated with the evasion of PMN functions and in vivo virulence.

Then we further examined whether severe invasive isolates of other than emm49 genotype have the mutation of the csrS and the csrR genes.	"emm49	72	77	Protein"	"csrS	112	116	Protein"	"csrR	125	129	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""emm49"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""csrS"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""csrR"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore, the expression of some human invasive disease - associated genes [ 5] including slo was enhanced in the csrS mutant ( Figure 5B), but not in the csrR mutant [ 20].

Furthermore, SLS hemolytic activity of invasive GAS is significantly decreased as compared with non - invasive strains ( data not shown) and SLS - deletion in invasive GAS did not affect PMN survival at all, excluding the possibility for the role of SLS in PMN necrosis seen in this study.

Extracellular deoxyribonuclease ( DNase) is a virulence factor that protects emm1 type GAS against neutrophil killing by degrading the DNA framework of neutrophil extracelluar traps ( NETs) [ 25], [ 26].

A study has demonstrated SLO from invasive GAS lyse PMN [ 27], however this effect is likely due to complement activation by SLO [ 28] or PMN activation [ 29] but not due to cytotoxity of SLO itself as judged by their flow cytometry profiles which are distinct from ours ( Figure 2A).

In contrast to the previous view [ 18], we observed that both of ScpC and SLO together, but not each of them, mediated sufficient in vivo virulence ( Table 1), thus compatible with the notion that plural virulence - associated factors under the regulation of csrS abrogate PMN bactericidal functions and induce invasive diseases in in vivo animal model.

Together, the results indicate that i) M. tuberculosis Rv2623 regulates mycobacterial growth in vitro and in vivo, and ii) Rv2623 is required for the entry of the tubercle bacillus into the chronic phase of infection in the host; in addition, iii) Rv2623 binds ATP; and iv) the growth - regulatory attribute of this USP is dependent on its ATP - binding activity.

This increase in lung pathology was also largely reversed in animals infected with the complemented Deltarv2623 attB:: Phsp60Rv2623 strain ( Figure 3B and C).

As in the guinea pig studies, results of complementation experiments involving the reintroduction of a single copy of wildtype rv2623 into Deltarv2623 M. tuberculosis reverses the hypervirulence ( Figure 4C) exhibited in the C3H / HeJ model, thus indicating that the observed growth phenotype of the tubercle bacillus deficient for the universal stress protein is rv2623 - specific.

Therefore, the hypervirulence of Deltarv2623 in guinea pigs and susceptible mice is intriguing; if Rv2623 provides M. tuberculosis protection against stress, it might be expected that the Rv2623 - deficient mutant would be attenuated in vivo.

HPLC analysis of nucleotides extracted from Rv2623D15E and Rv2623G117A revealed that the mutant proteins are indeed deficient in ATP - binding, exhibiting approximately34% ( p < 0. 001) and approximately29% ( p = 0. 0018) of the amount of ATP bound by wild - type Rv2623, respectively ( Figure 7B).

This study has provided substantial biochemical and structural evidence that M. tuberculosis Rv2623 is a bona fide nucleotide - binding USP: i) E. coli - expressed His6 - Rv2623 co - purifies with tightly bound ATP and ADP; ii) analysis of the 2. 9 A - resolution Rv2623 crystal structure, the first molecular model of a tandem - type USP, reveals four ATP - bound nucleotide - binding pockets; and iii) point mutations ( D15E, G117A) within the conserved L1 ( D15E) and beta4 ( G117A) regions of the structure, which were predicted to disrupt nucleotide - binding, yielded mutant proteins with attenuated ATP - binding capacity.

To exclude the possibility that the DeltabfiS, DeltabfmR, and DeltamifR mutant biofilms may have disaggregated prematurely, the formation of mutant biofilms was monitored daily by confocal microscopy over a period of 144 hr.

Furthermore, the phosphorylation of these two - component systems occurred in sequence with BfiS being phosphorylated first, followed by GacS, and lastly, MifR ( Table 1, Fig. 6).

BfiR harbors region 4 of Sigma - 70 ( RpoD) - like sigma factors, a domain involved in binding to - 35 promoter elements.

A multi - component switch composed of three unusual hybrid sensor kinases, RetS, LadS, and GacS, has recently been demonstrated to reciprocally orchestrate the transition from acute to chronic infection in P. aeruginosa, as well as to reciprocally regulate the transition between the planktonic and biofilm modes of growth by inversely coordinating repression of genes required for initial colonization, mainly genes responsible for exopolysaccharide components of the P. aeruginosa biofilm matrix [ 36], [ 37].

The finding is consistent with our observation of GacS playing a dual role in biofilm formation, with phosphorylation acting as a switch in the function of GacS ( Fig. 3, Table 2): GacS participates in the planktonic / biofilm switch in its non - phosphorylated state, but limits / regulates the rate of biomass accumulation and biofilm development when phosphorylated.

In turn, expression of the BfiS cognate response regulator, BfiR, was found to be RsmA dependent [ 77] ( see Fig. 6).

Crystal structures have been determined for three chaperones that coordinate translocation of effectors through the SPI - 1 T3SS ( InvB [ 11], SicP [ 12] and SigE [ 13]).

In addition to activating all of the T3SS structural operons, transcriptional profiling has uncovered new genes in the SsrB regulon that are required for bacterial pathogenesis including a translocated effector, SseL [ 19], [ 20], and a gene of unknown function called srfN that is common to the Salmonella genus [ 21].

To determine the cellular distribution of SrcA we constructed a srcA - HA allele and expressed this gene in wild type and in ssrB mutant cells under conditions that activate the SPI - 2 T3SS [ 24].

As a positive control, SseC, an SsrB - regulated translocon protein of the SPI - 2 T3SS was present in the secreted fraction from wild type cells but not from an ssrB mutant.

To verify the role of srcA on this phenotype, we complemented the srcA mutant with a wild type srcA gene under the control of its endogenous promoter, which restored in vivo fitness to that of wild type ( Fig. 1D).

CesT and SicP were the most structurally similar to SrcA, aligning with RMSD of 1. 8 A and 2. 2 A respectively.

CesT, SicP and SrcA contain several clusters of highly conserved amino acids notable on primary sequence alignments ( Fig. 2A).

Binding of SptP occurs primarily in the N - terminus of SicP [ 12], which is similar to the effector binding surface for SrcA predicted in silico.

SsaN contains conserved amino acid residues characteristic of Walker - A and Walker - B motifs of P - loop nucleoside triphosphate hydrolases, as well as a number of residues shown to contribute to ATP binding or ring stacking with the adenine base of ATP in the E. coli orthologue, EscN, ( Q412, E191, R366) ( Fig. S1).

SseL was immunoprecipitated specifically along with SrcA - FLAG with a SILAC ratio of 0. 08, whereas additional abundant proteins displayed SILAC ratios closer to approximately1 ( OmpF is shown, Fig. 5B) ( mean SILAC ratio of all other peptides identified was 0. 93 ( Dataset S1).

Using this approach SseL - HA and PipB2 - HA were depleted from the secreted protein fraction of srcA mutant cells ( Fig. 5C) but reached similar levels in the bacterial cytoplasm ( Fig. 5D).

In enteropathogenic E. coli, a surface - exposed electronegative residue in the CesT chaperone ( Glu142) likewise contributes to Tir secretion but not Tir binding [ 16], suggesting a role in either targeting bound cargo to the T3SS or in the secretion process itself.	"CesT	80	84	Protein"	"Tir	129	132	Protein"	"Tir	151	154	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CesT"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Tir"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Tir"", ""start_span"": 151, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, it is likely that other surface charged residues of SrcA are involved in these functions or that SrcA targets effector cargo to the secretion apparatus through a mechanism distinct from CesT.

Similar to CesT and SicP, the dimer interface of SrcA adopts a parallel configuration when comparing alpha2 helices of opposing subunits.

In our experiments, we could induce the ATPase domain of SsaN to oligomerize in the presence of SrcA, but not in its absence, which was intriguing because the purified enzyme lacked a domain at the carboxyl terminus thought to be involved in oligomer stability, at least for E. coli EscN [ 14].

The genes encoding the srcA chaperone and the effector cargos ( pipB2 and sseL) are found in all serotypes of Salmonella enterica that contain the SPI - 2 - encoded T3SS.

The expression of srcA is coordinated with T3SS transcriptional activity via the SsrA - SsrB two - component regulatory system encoded in SPI - 2.

Interestingly, STM2137 ( also known as SseK2) is a likely paralog of SseK1, an effector translocated by the SPI - 2 T3SS [ 33].

For example, InvB and SicP ( Salmonella SPI - 1), CesT ( enteropathogenic E. coli locus of enterocyte effacement) and Spa15 ( Shigella mxi / spa virulence plasmid region) chaperones are all encoded within the T3SS structural operons, implying they have co - evolved as a single genetic entity from a common ancestor.

Y. pestis homologs of two genes with previously identified roles in biofilm, yidE, which encodes a hyperadherence factor in E. coli [ 27], and cpxP, a member of the cpxPAR ESR system, were upregulated in the flowcell; but predicted adhesin genes were not upregulated.

Expression of genes in the pH 6 antigen locus ( psaEFABC), responsible for the synthesis and transport of the PsaA fimbriae that enhance resistance to phagocytosis by macrophages [ 35], [ 36], were higher in the bubo than the flea, although the usher protein gene psaC was upregulated in the flea compared to in vitro growth ( Tables 1, S1).

BvrR is a cytoplasmic protein that shows significant similarity to OmpR / PhoB subfamily of response regulator proteins with a specific Asp residue located within a conserved regulatory domain and an effector domain with DNA - binding activity [ 5].	"BvrR	0	4	Protein"	"OmpR	67	71	Protein"	"PhoB	74	78	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BvrR"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""OmpR"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PhoB"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To determine if the BvrR / BvrS system affects the metabolism, bvrR mutant and wild type strains were grown in synthetic minimal media.	"BvrR	20	24	Protein"	"BvrS	27	31	Protein"	"bvrR	63	67	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BvrR"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""BvrS"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""bvrR"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As mentioned before, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene ( pckA, BAB1 _ 2091) which is located upstream of the regulatory gene bvrR and divergently expressed was up - regulated.	"pckA	62	66	Protein"	"BAB1 _ 2091	68	79	Protein"	"bvrR	130	134	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""pckA"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""BAB1 _ 2091"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""bvrR"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Three of these, namely exoR, ompR and vjbR are down regulated and have been previously implicated in Brucella virulence.	"exoR	23	27	Protein"	"ompR	29	33	Protein"	"vjbR	38	42	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""exoR"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ompR"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""vjbR"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
All these data suggest that VjbR, similarly to the BvrR / BvrS system, is involved in the control of outer membrane composition and virulence.	"VjbR	28	32	Protein"	"BvrR	51	55	Protein"	"BvrS	58	62	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""VjbR"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""BvrR"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""BvrS"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Further analysis indicated that both the ExoR protein and the ExoS / ChvI two - component regulatory system are involved in the regulation of both polysaccharides and flagellum biosynthesis [ 31].	"ExoR	41	45	Protein"	"ExoS	62	66	Protein"	"ChvI	69	73	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ExoR"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ExoS"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ChvI"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Our results also support this hypothesis: the functional relationship between the exoR gene and the BvrR / BvrS system.	"exoR	82	86	Protein"	"BvrR	100	104	Protein"	"BvrS	107	111	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""exoR"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""BvrR"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""BvrS"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In addition, it has been demonstrated that some denitrification genes of the nor operon are required for Brucella virulence: norD in B. suis and norB in B. melitensis [ 10], [ 11].	"nor	77	80	Protein"	"norD	125	129	Protein"	"norB	145	149	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""nor"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""norD"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""norB"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
SeMac was characterized to determine whether SeMac has IgG endopeptidase activity and inhibits opsonophagocytosis of S. equi by horse PMNs.	"SeMac	0	5	Protein"	"SeMac	45	50	Protein"	"IgG endopeptidase	55	72	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SeMac"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SeMac"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IgG endopeptidase"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, SeMac is a cysteine endopeptidase with a limited activity against horse IgG and must have other function.	"SeMac	6	11	Protein"	"cysteine endopeptidase	17	39	Protein"	"IgG	78	81	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SeMac"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cysteine endopeptidase"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IgG"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
There are two kinds of Mac produced by GAS isolates [ 7], which use different mechanisms to block the interaction between IgG and Fc receptor on the surface of PMNs.	"Mac	23	26	Protein"	"IgG	122	125	Protein"	"Fc receptor	130	141	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mac"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IgG"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Fc receptor"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The results indicate that SeMac is a cysteine endopeptidase but does not inhibit opsonophagocytosis of S. equi by horse PMNs, suggesting that SeMac has function other than evading horse acquired immunity against S. equi infection.	"SeMac	26	31	Protein"	"cysteine endopeptidase	37	59	Protein"	"SeMac	142	147	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SeMac"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cysteine endopeptidase"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SeMac"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 147, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
S. equi Mac Gene S. equi genome encodes a Mac homologue SeMac.	"Mac	8	11	Protein"	"Mac	42	45	Protein"	"SeMac	56	61	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mac"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Mac"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SeMac"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The protein shares 62. 4% identity in amino acid sequence with Mac made by serotype M1 GAS and a putative secretion signal sequence ( amino acids 1 - 34), and the catalytic residues of GAS Mac consisting of Cys94, His262 and Asp284 are conserved in SeMac ( Cys102, His272 and Asp 294) ( Fig. 1).	"Mac	63	66	Protein"	"Mac	189	192	Protein"	"SeMac	249	254	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mac"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Mac"", ""start_span"": 189, ""end_span"": 192, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SeMac"", ""start_span"": 249, ""end_span"": 254, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Endopeptidase Activity of SeMac against Horse IgG1 and Human IgG	"SeMac	26	31	Protein"	"IgG1	46	50	Protein"	"IgG	61	64	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SeMac"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IgG1"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IgG"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The results indicate that SeMac is a cysteine endopeptidase, which uses Cys102, His272 and Asp294 as its catalytic triad to cleave human IgG.	"SeMac	26	31	Protein"	"cysteine endopeptidase	37	59	Protein"	"IgG	137	140	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SeMac"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cysteine endopeptidase"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IgG"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Purified recombinant SeMac and GAS Mac were then tested for activity to cleave horse IgG.	"SeMac	21	26	Protein"	"Mac	35	38	Protein"	"IgG	85	88	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SeMac"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Mac"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IgG"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, the Mac proteins can cleave IgG1 but not IgG4.	"Mac	15	18	Protein"	"IgG1	39	43	Protein"	"IgG4	52	56	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mac"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IgG1"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IgG4"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Due to the unavailability of other purified subgroup IgG, it is not known whether SeMac cleaves the other IgG subgroups.	"IgG	53	56	Protein"	"SeMac	82	87	Protein"	"IgG	106	109	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IgG"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SeMac"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IgG"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
If this is true, SeMac should inhibit opsonophagocytosis of GAS by human PMNs, since SeMac efficiently cleaves human IgG.	"SeMac	17	22	Protein"	"SeMac	85	90	Protein"	"IgG	117	120	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SeMac"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SeMac"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IgG"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In this study we describe that SeMac is a cysteine endopeptidase with limited activity against horse IgG and is unable to inhibit opsonophagocytosis of S. equi by horse PMNs in a whole blood assay.	"SeMac	31	36	Protein"	"cysteine endopeptidase	42	64	Protein"	"IgG	101	104	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SeMac"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cysteine endopeptidase"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IgG"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, like GAS M1 Mac [ 7, 8], SeMac is a cysteine endopeptidase.	"Mac	18	21	Protein"	"SeMac	31	36	Protein"	"cysteine endopeptidase	42	64	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mac"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SeMac"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cysteine endopeptidase"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
If this is true, horse IgG3 may be also cleavable by SeMac, while the other five horse IgG subgroups may not be cleaved.	"IgG3	23	27	Protein"	"SeMac	53	58	Protein"	"IgG	87	90	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IgG3"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SeMac"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IgG"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
SeMac can cleave human IgG and inhibit the opsonophagocytosis of GAS by human PMNs, but it has limited enzymatic activity against horse IgG and is unable to inhibit opsonophagocytosis of S. equi by horse PMNs.	"SeMac	0	5	Protein"	"IgG	23	26	Protein"	"IgG	136	139	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SeMac"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IgG"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IgG"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, there is a correlation between the enzymatic activity of SeMac and its ability to inhibit opsonophagocytosis, suggesting that SeMac functions like GAS M1 Mac in the inhibition of opsonophagocytosis of GAS by human PMNs.	"SeMac	63	68	Protein"	"SeMac	132	137	Protein"	"Mac	160	163	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SeMac"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SeMac"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Mac"", ""start_span"": 160, ""end_span"": 163, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
