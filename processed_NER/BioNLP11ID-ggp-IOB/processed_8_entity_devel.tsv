That PmrB is likely to sense changes in pH directly is supported by three findings: ( i) the mild acid pH - dependent activation of the PmrA - regulated gene pbgP was dramatically reduced in a strain lacking pmrB ( Fig. 3), ( ii) the periplasmic domain of PmrB was necessary for activation of pbgP under mild acid conditions ( Fig. 5), and ( iii) single amino acid substitutions in conserved histidine and glutamic acid residues located in the periplasmic domain of PmrB abolished its ability to stimulate pbgP transcription at pH 5. 8 ( Fig. 6).

However, the effects of Mlc on hilD expression and bacterial invasiveness were not seen in the hilE mutant, and hilE expression was increased in the mlc mutant, which suggests that Mlc exerts positive effects on the expression of SPI1 genes by reducing the expression of HilE, which is known to down - regulate the expression of SPI1 genes through direct interaction with HilD.
