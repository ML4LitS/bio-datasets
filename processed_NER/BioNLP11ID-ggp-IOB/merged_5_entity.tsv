The low level of hilD expression in the mlc mutant can be explained by the fact that the increased level of HilE in the mlc mutant can repress the activity of HilD, which is known to act as an activator of its own expression ( 9, 36).	hilD,17,21,Protein	mlc,40,43,Protein	HilE,108,112,Protein	mlc,120,123,Protein	HilD,159,163,Protein	"[{""token"": ""hilD"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mlc"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""HilE"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mlc"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""HilD"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 163, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	valid
The 2 - 3 - fold decrease in hilD expression caused by the mlc mutation is sufficient to account for the nearly 10 - fold decrease in hilA and invFA transcription, owing to the nature of the feed - forward regulatory loop, in that moderate effects on HilD production are amplified ( 9).	hilD,29,33,Protein	mlc,59,62,Protein	hilA,134,138,Protein	invFA,143,148,Protein	HilD,251,255,Protein	"[{""token"": ""hilD"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mlc"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilA"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""invFA"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""HilD"", ""start_span"": 251, ""end_span"": 255, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	valid

Thus, carbon metabolism sensed by PhoB / R may also affect hilE expression ( 22), and this may be one of the reasons for the elevated hilE expression in the presence of carbohydrates in the mlc mutant ( Figure 6A).

Given that insertional inactivation of RR gene results in inactivation of HK gene [ 22] which are co - transcribed ( Fig. 1), the strain with insertionally inactivated sak189 gene can be considered as sak189 / sak188 double mutant strain, while the strain with insertionally inactivated sak188 gene - as sak188 mutant strain.	sak189,168,174,Protein	sak189,201,207,Protein	sak188,210,216,Protein	sak188,287,293,Protein	sak188,304,310,Protein	"[{""token"": ""sak189"", ""start_span"": 168, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak189"", ""start_span"": 201, ""end_span"": 207, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak188"", ""start_span"": 210, ""end_span"": 216, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak188"", ""start_span"": 287, ""end_span"": 293, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak188"", ""start_span"": 304, ""end_span"": 310, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
