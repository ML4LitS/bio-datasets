Substitution of a conserved histidine or of either one of four conserved glutamic acid residues in the periplasmic domain of PmrB severely decreased or abolished the mild acid - promoted transcription of PmrA - activated genes.

Our results suggest that protonation of the PmrB periplasmic histidine and / or of the glutamic acid residues activate the PmrA protein, and that mild acid promotes cellular changes resulting in polymyxin B resistance.

The PmrA protein and its cognate sensor kinase PmrB form a two - component regulatory system that is required for virulence in mice ( Gunn et al., 2000), infection of chicken macrophages ( Zhao et al., 2002), growth in soil ( Chamnongpol et al., 2002), resistance to the cationic peptide antibiotic polymyxin B ( Roland et al., 1993) and resistance to Fe3 + - ( Wosten et al., 2000) and Al3 + - mediated killing ( Nishino et al., 2006).

Besides mild acid pH, two other stimuli are known to promote expression of PmrA - activated genes: ( i) submillimolar levels of extracellular Fe3 + or Al3 +, which are directly sensed by the PmrB protein ( Wosten et al., 2000), and ( ii) low concentrations of extracellular Mg2 + ( Soncini and Groisman, 1996) ( Fig. 1).

This medium lacked Fe3 + or Al3 +, the only known PmrB ligands ( Wosten et al., 2000), and contained 10 mM MgCl2, which represses expression of PmrA - activated genes ( Soncini and Groisman, 1996; Kox et al., 2000).

We determined that Chelex 100 was effective at chelating iron because expression of the pmrA - independent iron - repressed iroA gene ( Hall and Foster, 1996) was induced to higher levels in cultures treated with Chelex 100 ( Fig. 2D).

We determined that the regulatory protein PmrA is required for the transcriptional activation in response to mild acid pH because there was no induction of the three investigated genes in a pmrA mutant ( Fig. 2A - C).	"PmrA	42	46	Protein"	"pmrA	190	194	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pmrA"", ""start_span"": 190, ""end_span"": 194, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

This suggested that PmrA could become phosphorylated from another phosphodonor ( s) when PmrB is not present.

The PmrD protein is necessary for normal PmrA activation at pH 5. 8	"PmrD	4	8	Protein"	"PmrA	41	45	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrD"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These results imply that the pmrD gene was being expressed even though the media contained 10 mM MgCl2, a concentration known to repress transcription of PhoP - activated genes ( Soncini et al., 1996).	"pmrD	29	33	Protein"	"PhoP	154	158	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""pmrD"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PhoP"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In agreement with the gene transcription data, Western blot analysis of crude extracts using anti - PmrD antibodies showed that the PmrD protein was produced in cells grown in N - minimal medium pH 5. 8 and 10 mM MgCl2 but not in cells grown in the same medium buffered at pH 7. 7 ( Fig. 4B).	"PmrD	100	104	Protein"	"PmrD	132	136	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrD"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PmrD"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The results described above established that PmrB is required for activation of PmrA in response to mild acid pH.	"PmrB	45	49	Protein"	"PmrA	80	84	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Because the PmrA / PmrB system is required for resistance to the antimicrobial peptide polymyxin B ( Roland et al., 1993), we hypothesized that mild acid pH could induce this resistance.	"PmrA	12	16	Protein"	"PmrB	19	23	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This resistance was PmrA - dependent because a strain deficient in the pmrA gene was approximately 100 000 - fold more sensitive to polymyxin B than the wild - type strain when grown pH 5. 8 ( Fig. 7).	"PmrA	20	24	Protein"	"pmrA	71	75	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pmrA"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The requirement of periplasmic PmrB residues in the mild acid pH activation of PmrA - regulated genes suggests that this signalling pathway responds to changes in extracytoplasmic pH.

Thus, PmrD may be necessary to ensure that the amount of phosphorylated PmrA is such to promote transcription of its regulated genes.

Based on these results, we propose that Mlc functions to sense the availability of sugars and is linked to virulence gene regulation by its ability to control hilE expression in Salmonella.

However, it has been shown that HilD provides an essential activating function for hilA in the absence of negative regulators ( 14).

A null mutation in hilE causes an increase in hilA expression and invasion.	"hilE	19	23	Protein"	"hilA	46	50	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""hilE"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilA"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In the present study, a Salmonella Typhimurium mlc mutant was constructed to investigate the contribution of Mlc to the virulence phenotype.

Subsequently, we studied whether hilE expression was affected by Mlc.	"hilE	33	37	Protein"	"Mlc	65	68	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""hilE"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Mlc"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The hilE mRNA level measured by real - time PCR also revealed that hilE expression was increased in SR1304 by about 2 - fold ( Figure 3A).

Invasiveness for HEp - 2 cells was reduced to 39. 1% of the wild - type level by mlc mutation, whereas it was increased by 1. 57 - fold by hilE mutation ( Figure 3B).

The activity of the purified Mlc - His6 protein was verified with the control gel mobility shift experiment employing the Salmonella ptsG DNA fragment that contains the known Mlc - binding site ( data not shown).

When the labeled hilE promoter DNA was incubated with 2 - fold dilutions of the purified Mlc - His6 protein ( 100 - 800nM) in the presence of the non - specific DNA competitor poly dI - dC, the concentration - dependent formation of protein - DNA complexes was observed ( Figure 5A).

The addition of cold probe released the labeled probe from the retarded complex ( Figure 5A, right panel), which indicates specific binding of Mlc to the hilE P3 promoter DNA.

On the other hand, the expression in SR1304 of both hilE and hilD was increased in the presence of glucose, mannose or arabinose.

Although the Salmonella mlc mutant was less invasive for epithelial cells than the wild - type strain, the extent of the reduction in invasiveness and cytotoxicity of the mlc mutant was not as great as we had expected, considering the observed reduction in SPI1 gene expression ( Figure 2).

The UTR of the hilA gene is also up to 350nt in length, and is suggested to be involved in the complex regulation of hilA in response to environmental signals ( 8, 12).

The glucose present in DLB ( LB broth diluted 1: 5) decreased hilA expression 2. 5 - fold, as compared to DLB without glucose, while lactose and arabinose had little effect on hilA expression ( 45).

We speculate that the nutrient - rich LB broth may mask the effect of the sugar on hilE expression because the effect of sugar addition on hilA expression was more distinct in DLB than LB ( 45).

To check this suspected mutant, Southern hybridization analyses were employed using probes of SpcR gene, an internal fragment of salKR, and pUC18, respectively.

In wild type strain 05ZYH33, the internal fragment of salKR probe hybridized with a single 4. 0 kb Cla I fragment ( Fig. 3C, lane 1), whereas the SpcR and pUC18 probes did not hybridized with the genomic DNA ( Fig. 3B and 3D, lane 1).

In the suspected mutant, a 3. 6 kb restriction fragment hybridized with the SpcR probe ( Fig. 3B, lane 2), while no hybridization signal was detected when the internal fragment of salKR and pUC18 served as the probes ( Fig. 3C and 3D, lane 2).

Additionally, the allelic replacement of the wild - type salKR genes by the SpcR cassette in the suspected mutant was also confirmed by multiple - PCR analysis and sequencing with primers specific to genomic regions lying out the homologous left and right arms ( Fig. 3A and 3E).

All these results demonstrate that an isogenic knockout mutant of salKR ( namely DeltasalKR) was successfully constructed.

An experimental infection model in piglets was designed to assess the role of SalK / SalR in virulence.

All these results strongly suggest that SalK / SalR plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Chinese isolates of highly invasive SS2.

Obviously, lack of SalK / SalR badly impaired the capability of 05ZYH33 to colonize the various tissues of piglets.

In the WT / DeltasalKR coinfection group, besides the detection of wild - type bacteria in all the specimens, DeltasalKR mutant bacteria could also be isolated from some susceptible tissues ( such as heart, kidney, tonsil and brain) at a lower degree than the wild - type strain.

However, DeltasalKR had a higher mortality rate than that of WT, which means that DeltasalKR was less able to resist killing by PMNs, key mediators of innate immunity.

In total, the absence of SalK / SalR led to decreased expression of 26 genes spread throughout the genome ( i. e. 1. 2% of the 2194 tested).

Furthermore, orotidine - 5 - phosphate decarboxylase ( 05SSU1009), a newly identified pathogenesis - related protein in Vibrio vulnificus [ 31], was also found to be repressed greatly in DeltasalKR.

To examine the validity of the microarray data, we performed further quantitative real - time PCR analysis on 42 genes using RNA from three independent cultures of each strain ( WT, the DeltasalKR mutant and the complemented strain CDeltasalKR).	"DeltasalKR	186	196	Protein"	"CDeltasalKR	232	243	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltasalKR"", ""start_span"": 186, ""end_span"": 196, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CDeltasalKR"", ""start_span"": 232, ""end_span"": 243, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In this study, we carried out a detailed structural and functional analysis of a unique two - component regulatory system designated SalK / SalR which is located in the putative 89K PAI.	"SalK	133	137	Protein"	"SalR	140	144	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SalK"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SalR"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These results indicate definitely that SalK / SalR plays a critical role in the pathogenicity of SS2.	"SalK	39	43	Protein"	"SalR	46	50	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SalK"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SalR"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The reduction in virulence was mostly restored in a complemented strain upon reintroduction of functional copies of salK and salR into the mutant, suggesting that it did not result from polar effects on expression of flanking genes.	"salK	116	120	Protein"	"salR	125	129	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""salK"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""salR"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, genes immediately flanking the salKR locus were identified as transcriptionally unaffected by the disruption of the salKR genes.	"salKR	40	45	Protein"	"salKR	125	130	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""salKR"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""salKR"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This result is in agreement with the predicted operon organization in the genome, which suggests that salK and salR are a single co - transcriptional unit.	"salK	102	106	Protein"	"salR	111	115	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""salK"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""salR"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Among the 26 target genes affected by SalK / SalR, 17 of them ( 65. 4%) were predicted to be monocistronically transcribed, the others to be part of larger transcriptional units ( Table 2).	"SalK	38	42	Protein"	"SalR	45	49	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SalK"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SalR"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It seems that SalK / SalR may control the full virulence of SS2 by regulating distant gene expression at the genome - wide level.

Secondly, some of the TCSTSs of S. pneumoniae were suggested to be involved in key processes of pathogenesis, such as autolysis and cell - cell signaling [ 52], SalK / SalR might regulate similar processes in Chinese SS2 virulent isolates.

In conclusion, a unique two - component regulatory system SalK / SalR has been identified from a putative 89K PAI in Chinese isolates of highly pathogenic SS2.	"SalK	58	62	Protein"	"SalR	65	69	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SalK"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SalR"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Prior to this study, SalK / SalR is only known to be associated with the production of a kind of lantibiotic peptide named salivaricin A ( SalA) in S. salivarius [ 11], as yet, this TCSTS has not been linked to the regulation of bacterial virulence.

Our data confirm, for the first time, that SalK / SalR is absolutely indispensable for the full virulence of Chinese highly invasive SS2 strains, although we fails to define its precise regulatory mechanism.

RpoE fine tunes expression of a subset of SsrB - regulated virulence factors in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium	"RpoE	0	4	Protein"	"SsrB	42	46	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RpoE"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Results In this study we demonstrate that RpoE is involved in fine - tuning the expression of a subset of SsrB - regulated genes found in the Salmonella pathogenicity island - 2 ( SPI - 2) genetic locus that encodes a horizontally acquired type III secretion system, and unlinked genes integrated into this regulon that are required for virulence in host animals.

Conclusion These data point to a potential connection between the virulence phenotype of strains lacking ssrB and rpoE, and highlight new transcriptional regulation that might be essential for appropriate temporal and spatial control of the virulence - associated type III secretion system during host infection.

One alternative sigma factor, RpoE ( sigmaE) responds to envelope stress at the cell surface.

Release of sigmaE from its inner membrane anchored anti - sigma factor, RseA, leads to induction of genes required to maintain cell envelope integrity [ 11].	"sigmaE	11	17	Protein"	"RseA	72	76	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""sigmaE"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RseA"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Although proficient at cellular invasion, rpoE or ssrB mutants are highly attenuated for intracellular survival in both cultured cells and animal hosts [ 16].	"rpoE	42	46	Protein"	"ssrB	50	54	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""rpoE"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ssrB"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In addition, the expression of rpoE and ssrB is up - regulated within macrophages [ 17].

Taken together, a connection between sigmaE and SsrB is suggested from the available literature, however the role of sigmaE in activating SsrB - regulated genes has not been studied.	"SsrB	48	52	Protein"	"SsrB	138	142	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We tested the hypothesis that RpoE is involved in expression of genes that use the SsrB response regulator for activation.	"RpoE	30	34	Protein"	"SsrB	83	87	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RpoE"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These data help unite the virulence phenotypes of strains lacking SsrB and RpoE, and highlight new transcriptional regulation that might be essential for appropriate temporal and spatial control of the virulence - associated type III secretion system during host infection.	"SsrB	66	70	Protein"	"RpoE	75	79	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RpoE"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Deletion of rpoE affects a subset of SsrB - regulated virulence genes Salmonella virulence gene expression is coordinated in vivo and may be regulated, in part, by alternative sigma factor ( s) in order to quickly respond to the host environment.	"rpoE	12	16	Protein"	"SsrB	37	41	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""rpoE"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In these complementation experiments, attempts were made to examine the levels of SseB secreted into the culture supernatant [ 21], however consistent with previous observations [ 22, 23] perturbations to the rpoE pathway increased cell lysis resulting in contamination of secreted fractions with cytosolic proteins which precluded accurate interpretation ( data not shown).	"SseB	82	86	Protein"	"rpoE	209	213	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SseB"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""rpoE"", ""start_span"": 209, ""end_span"": 213, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Together, these data indicate that sigmaE can have a variable and bidirectional effect on SsrB - regulated virulence genes.	"sigmaE	35	41	Protein"	"SsrB	90	94	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""sigmaE"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The effect of RpoE on virulence genes is downstream of ssrB expression	"RpoE	14	18	Protein"	"ssrB	55	59	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RpoE"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ssrB"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In this work we found that the alternative sigma factor, sigmaE, is involved in fine tuning the expressing of a subset of SsrB - regulated virulence genes required for Salmonella pathogenesis.	"sigmaE	57	63	Protein"	"SsrB	122	126	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""sigmaE"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The results from this study demonstrate that sigmaE has the ability to affect expression of SsrB - regulated virulence genes and offers potential insight into the virulence attenuation of rpoE mutants.	"SsrB	92	96	Protein"	"rpoE	188	192	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""rpoE"", ""start_span"": 188, ""end_span"": 192, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
One mutant had an insertion in a cheB gene homologue, encoding a methylesterase involved in chemotaxis ( CheB2).	"cheB	33	37	Protein"	"CheB2	105	110	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cheB"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CheB2"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We show that, in contrast to the cheB2 mutant, a cheB1 mutant is not attenuated for virulence in C. elegans whereas in vitro motility and chemotaxis are severely impaired.	"cheB2	33	38	Protein"	"cheB1	49	54	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheB1"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We conclude that the virulence defect of the cheB2 mutant is not linked with a global motility defect but that instead the cheB2 gene is involved in a specific chemotactic response, which takes place during infection and is required for P. aeruginosa pathogenicity.	"cheB2	45	50	Protein"	"cheB2	123	128	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The second matched PA4380, which encodes a protein with 76% similarity to Pseudomonas fluorescens ColS, a histidine kinase sensor from a two - component regulatory system.

In P. fluorescens ColS has been implicated in root colonization while in Pseudomonas putida it has been reported to be involved in regulating TN4652 transposition and heavy metal resistance [ 37], [ 38], [ 39], [ 40].

Another gene was identified as PA4554, which encodes the type 4 fimbrial adhesin PilY1 [ 41].

First, PA4953 encodes a protein with similarity to the E. coli MotB, one of a pair of proteins, which contributes to flagellar rotation [ 23], [ 42], [ 43].

Secondly, we found an insertion in PA0173 ( cheB2), one of four cheB gene homologues in the P. aeruginosa genome sequence.

In the remaining mutants, one contained a transposon insertion in PA5479, which encodes a protein similar to GltP from E. coli, a glutamate - aspartate carrier protein.

Since, in addition to the insertion in PA2585, we isolated a mutant with an insertion in a neighbor gene PA2588, it suggests that this cluster of genes might be required for virulence.

In addition to TB4953s ( motB, p < 0. 0001) and TB0173s ( cheB2, p < 0. 001), that presented strongly reduced adherence, five other clones were significantly affected in their adherence to cells when compared to the parental TB isolate ( Figure S1 and Table 1).

The TB0173s ( cheB2) ( Figure 2 and Table 1) and TB4953s ( motB) ( Table 1) mutants showed a reduction in swimming and swarming motility, respectively.

To validate that the loss of virulence and other phenotypic changes observed with the TB strain were a result of the transposon disruption of the cheB2 gene, we generated a new mutant by interrupting the cheB2 gene ( see Materials and Methods).

As shown in Figure 3A, the newly engineered cheB2 mutant, called TB0173i ( p < 0. 005), showed a delayed C. elegans killing comparable to the original STM cheB2 mutant TB0173s ( p < 0. 004).	"cheB2	44	49	Protein"	"cheB2	155	160	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 160, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We reintroduced, in the cheB2 mutant, the wild - type cheB2 gene using an integration - proficient vector, mini - CTX1 [ 47].	"cheB2	24	29	Protein"	"cheB2	54	59	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As shown in Figure 3B the virulence was restored in the complemented cheB2 mutant TB0173sp2B2 ( p < 0. 009), whereas the cheB2 mutant strain TB0173sCTX ( p < 0. 005) remained fully attenuated.	"cheB2	69	74	Protein"	"cheB2	121	126	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The cheB1 mutant was used to feed C. elegans in the slow killing assay and the survival percentage was compared to those obtained when using the cheB2 mutant or the parental TB strain ( Figure 3C).	"cheB1	4	9	Protein"	"cheB2	145	150	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cheB1"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This is in contrast to the loss of virulence in the original cheB2 mutant ( TB0173s) and the insertional cheB2 mutant TB0173i.	"cheB2	61	66	Protein"	"cheB2	105	110	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The swimming or swarming motility defect is, however, much more severe in the cheB1 mutant as compared to the cheB2 mutant.	"cheB1	78	83	Protein"	"cheB2	110	115	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cheB1"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This mutant, named TB0173s, has a transposon insertion in PA0173, cheB2, one of four cheB genes found in P. aeruginosa.	"PA0173	58	64	Protein"	"cheB2	66	71	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PA0173"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As many as 26 MCPs have been identified in P. aeruginosa [ 56], and it has been proposed that the CheB2 protein functions at least with McpB [ 57].	"CheB2	98	103	Protein"	"McpB	136	140	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CheB2"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""McpB"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Interestingly, we observed that a mutation in the cheB1 gene yields different phenotypes compared to the cheB2 mutation.	"cheB1	50	55	Protein"	"cheB2	105	110	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cheB1"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Finally, in chemotaxis assays using tryptone as chemo - attractant, we observed that, while the cheB1 mutant was strongly affected, the cheB2 mutant had a mild phenotype.	"cheB1	96	101	Protein"	"cheB2	136	141	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cheB1"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Schuster and collaborators have reported that the cluster II genes are induced during stationary phase, are regulated by quorum sensing and that RpoS, the stationary phase RNA polymerase sigma factor, plays a role in controlling cheB2 gene expression [ 58].	"RpoS	145	149	Protein"	"cheB2	229	234	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RpoS"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 229, ""end_span"": 234, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Finally, using fluorescent protein - tagged CheY and CheA, it was shown that the Che1 proteins ( cluster I) localized to the flagellated pole throughout growth [ 61].	"CheY	44	48	Protein"	"CheA	53	57	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CheY"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CheA"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As previously mentioned, even though the cheB2 mutant is impaired in motility, it is likely that the cheB2 defect in virulence is not linked to this phenotype but to additional traits of virulence and attachment that have not yet been determined.	"cheB2	41	46	Protein"	"cheB2	101	106	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore, in our study, we isolated a second mutant with reduced motility TB4953s ( motB mutant) ( Table 1), and while this isolate was attenuated in the high throughput assay, it did not show a reduction in killing in the slow assay ( data not shown), further suggesting that the loss of virulence seen in the cheB2 mutant strain ( TB0173s) is not solely due to a reduction or change in motility.	"motB	87	91	Protein"	"cheB2	314	319	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""motB"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 314, ""end_span"": 319, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
