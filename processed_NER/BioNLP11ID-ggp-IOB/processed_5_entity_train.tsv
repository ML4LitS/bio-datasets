Unlike the regulatory mechanism of FimA by FimR, this regulation of the mfa1 gene is accomplished by FimR directly binding to the promoter region of mfa1.

FimR, a response regulator of the fimS / fimR two - component system was identified, and FimA expression was found to be dramatically reduced in fimR mutants ( Hayashi et al., 2000).

Evidence is provided that unlike FimR - dependent fimA expression, FimR regulates mfa1 expression by directly binding to the promoter region of mfa1.

Role of FimR in mfa1 expression The fimA gene is the only gene known to be tightly controlled by the FimS / FimR system.

It was postulated that different mechanisms might be involved in FimR - mediated mfa1 expression, since expression regulation of mfa1 by FimR was not controlled as tightly as observed for fimA expression.

A comparison of the transcriptional level of the mfa1 in P. gingivalis wild - type strain and in the fimR mutant indicates that the FimS / FimR system is a positive regulator for the mfa1 gene, although the system controls two fimbrial genes at different levels.

As depicted in Figure S2, hybridization of SpeI - digested genomic DNA with a 32P labeled phoP probe resulted in two bands of different sizes, one corresponding to the SpeI fragment harboring the H37Ra phoP gene ( 50 kb), and the other to the larger SpeI fragment created by integration of the I36 cosmid into the genome of H37Ra at the attB site.

As shown in Figure 3, splenocytes from mice that were inoculated with H37Rv produced high amounts of IFN - gamma upon stimulation with ESAT - 6 or CFP - 10, whereas the responses of H37Ra, H37Ra:: fadE5, and H37Ra:: rpsL infected mice were extremely weak.

The observation that knocking - in the ESX - 1 region of H37Rv into H37Ra ( H37Ra:: RD1 - ppe68 - ko), and the resultant diploidy, did not improve the ESAT - 6 - specific T cell responses ( Figure 3B), further argues that PhoP - dependent ESAT - secretion might be regulated via a mechanism that lies outside the RD1 region.

As closer inspection of the available literature on transcriptional analyses of a H37Rv - phoP ko strain [ 21] and H37Ra [ 12] suggested that the expression of gene cluster rv3612c - rv3616c is reduced in both strains, we evaluated the expression level of rv3614c in H37Rv, H37Ra, and H37Ra:: phoP by quantitative real time PCR ( qRT - PCR).

Since phosphorylation of GacS occurred following 8 hr of surface attached growth ( Table 1) and since RetS directly modulates the phosphorylation state of GacS [ 38], the findings may suggest that RetS only remains functional for a period of 8 hours during initial attachment after which RetS is rendered non - functional.

These include the effector - chaperone pair of SseF - SscB, and the chaperone SseA that binds translocon components SseD and SseB [ 8], [ 9], [ 10].

Identification of an SsrB - regulated secretion chaperone Transcriptional profiling of SsrB - regulated genes in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. Typhimurium) [ 22] identified a hypothetical gene, STM2138 ( named srcA hereafter), that was co - regulated with genes in SPI - 2 and repressed approximately20 - fold in an ssrB mutant compared to wild type.

This analysis revealed a strong SsrB binding site spanning 10 syntenic probes within the intergenic region ( IGR) upstream of srcA, that together with the transcriptional data corroborated a direct regulatory role for SsrB on srcA expression ( Fig. 1A).

The direct binding of SsrB to the promoter region upstream of srcA, along with SsrB - regulation of both sseL [ 19], [ 20] and pipB2 [ 32] is indicative of multiple cis - regulatory mutation events that have allowed for functional coordination of the distributed secretion apparatus, chaperone and effector cargos.

Only the genes encoding for chitobiose phosphotransferase ( PTS) uptake and utilization systems ( chbBC; chbF), and for a PTS system of unknown specificity ( frwBCD) were significantly upregulated in the flea [ 16], [ 17].

The ymt gene was among the most highly expressed genes in the flea ( Table S3), but neither it nor the known transmission factors ( hmsHFRS, hmsT, hmsP, and gmhA) showed significantly higher expression in the flea than in vitro at 21degreesC, indicating that they are induced primarily by low temperature, and not by environmental factors specific to the flea gut.

Interestingly, our experiments to study the intracellular transcriptional level of BvrR / BvrS controlled genes ( see below) showed that whereas norC was induced intracellularly, nirK and nosZ were less expressed.

According to this, it has been demonstrated that in A. tumefaciens the pckA genes is indeed under the control of ChvG / ChvI [ 16] and that null mutants in S. meliloti exoS and chvI have pleiotropic growth defects and were unable to grow on several carbon sources [ 17].

The two - regulatory systems ChvG ( ExoS) / ChvI in S. meliloti and A. tumefaciens posses a high level of identity with the Brucella BvrR / BvrS [ 25], [ 26].

The type - 1 Mac, such as M1 Mac produced by serotype M1 GAS strains, has high enzymatic activity and low affinity to Fc receptor on the surface of PMNs, while the type - 2 Mac can bind to the Fc receptor and has lower enzymatic activity [ 9].

While both proteins cleaved human IgG efficiently, only a small fraction of horse IgG was cleaved by either protein ( Fig. 4B), suggesting that SeMac or GAS Mac cannot digest all subgroups of horse IgG.
