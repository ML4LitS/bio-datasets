Only two clusters ( spy0127 - 0130 and spy1701 - 1704) could have been identified without neighbor clustering; however, a number of these genes were initially annotated as hypothetical proteins, so a potential relationship between the gene members may not have been readily apparent.	spy0127,20,27,Protein	0130,30,34,Protein	spy1701,39,46,Protein	1704,49,53,Protein	"[{""token"": ""spy0127"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""0130"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""spy1701"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""1704"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	train
The upregulated spy0127 - 0130 cluster is part of a larger genomic region known as FCT ( for fibronectin - and collagen - binding proteins and T antigen - encoding loci), which spans spy0123 - 0136 in the SF370 genome and encodes surface proteins and transcriptional regulators [ 46].	spy0127,16,23,Protein	0130,26,30,Protein	spy0123,183,190,Protein	0136,193,197,Protein	"[{""token"": ""spy0127"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""0130"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""spy0123"", ""start_span"": 183, ""end_span"": 190, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""0136"", ""start_span"": 193, ""end_span"": 197, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	train

We posited that a deletion in the spy0129 sortase gene may have the greatest overall effect on the production and processing of the gene products of this cluster, since both the spy0128 and spy0130 gene products do not localize to the cell - wall surface in the absence of the sortase enzyme [ 36].	spy0129,34,41,Protein	spy0128,178,185,Protein	spy0130,190,197,Protein	sortase,277,284,Protein	"[{""token"": ""spy0129"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""spy0128"", ""start_span"": 178, ""end_span"": 185, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""spy0130"", ""start_span"": 190, ""end_span"": 197, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sortase"", ""start_span"": 277, ""end_span"": 284, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	train

Previous studies using animal - passaged GAS have shown that mutations in both csrS and csrR gene are important for the invasive phenotype [ 5], [ 6], and mutation frequency of csrS and csrR seems to be the same [ 21].	csrS,79,83,Protein	csrR,88,92,Protein	csrS,177,181,Protein	csrR,186,190,Protein	"[{""token"": ""csrS"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""csrR"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""csrS"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 181, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""csrR"", ""start_span"": 186, ""end_span"": 190, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	train
On the contrary of a dogma that CsrS / R is a definitive member of the two - component regulatory systems, which involve a coordinate pair of proteins known as the sensor kinase and the response regulator [ 20], CsrS may transmit a signal not only to CsrR but also to other regulators.

Therefore, the second important observation in the present study is that an essential requirement of csrS mutation for invasive infection is associated with increased expression of ScpC and SLO and in vitro evasion of PMN functions, though we do not exclude the possibility that other CsrS - regulating factors contribute to the escape of invasive GAS from host defense.	csrS,101,105,Protein	ScpC,181,185,Protein	SLO,190,193,Protein	CsrS,285,289,Protein	"[{""token"": ""csrS"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ScpC"", ""start_span"": 181, ""end_span"": 185, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SLO"", ""start_span"": 190, ""end_span"": 193, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CsrS"", ""start_span"": 285, ""end_span"": 289, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	train

Given that insertional inactivation of sak188 gene does not affect beta - antigen expression, we suggest that beta - antigen expression can be activated independently of Sak188, perhaps through small - molecular - weight phosphodonors such as acetyl phosphate or other noncognate histidine kinases.	sak188,39,45,Protein	beta - antigen,67,81,Protein	beta - antigen,110,124,Protein	Sak188,170,176,Protein	"[{""token"": ""sak188"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""beta - antigen"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""beta - antigen"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Sak188"", ""start_span"": 170, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
