Also, the late endosomal / lysosomal targeting signal is conserved, supporting the hypothesis that the protein is localized to these vesicle membranes.

This suggests that the function of the TACC proteins may have evolved from performing assembly or coordination functions in the centrosome to include a more intimate role in the functional evolution of chromatin remodeling, transcriptional and posttranscriptional complexes in the cell.

One of these isoforms, TACC1S is localized exclusively to the cytoplasm [ 19], suggesting that the shorter isoforms would not be able to interact with elements of the chomatin remodeling and / or RNA processing machinery in the nucleus.

The localization of the vertebrate TACC proteins in the interphase nucleus [ 15, 26, 27] suggests that they have additional functions outside their ancient role in the centrosome and microtubule dynamics.

However, over the process of evolutionary time, with the acquisition of new domains and duplication of the chordate TACC precursor, the chordate TACC proteins have acquired the ability to directly interact with some of the other components of these complexes ( such as the LSm proteins, nuclear hormone receptors, GAS41, accessory proteins and transcription factors), and thus evolved additional functions within these complexes.

The cell bodies were chosen for evaluation rather than the outer segments, since in the mouse, the ultrastructural differences between rod and cone somata are much greater than are the differences between the outer segments [ 26].

The second cell population in the ONL of the rd7 retina has some of the nuclear features of normal rods, such as a single, dense mass of heterochromatin and moderately electron - dense euchromatin ( Figure 7H); yet these cells also show features of cones.

Lastly, 38% ( 19 / 50) of the rd7 photoreceptors selected for somal area quantitation had prominent juxtanuclear mitochondria ( red arrow in Figure 7H; unpublished data).

This analysis permitted us to evaluate the wild - type rods for juxtanuclear mitochondria at multiple planes of section; however, serial sections of individual cell bodies were not performed.

The cell bodies are nearly round and consist almost exclusively of a nucleus with a single, dense mass of heterochromatin.

The E1 and E2 components are specific to BCKDH, whereas E3 is also used by pyruvate and alpha - ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes [ 3] and the glycine cleavage system [ 4].

Mutations in the ATRX gene, which is located on the female sex chromosome ( X), provided the first example of a human disease ( ATR - X syndrome) associated with defects in such proteins.

Studies of X - chromosome inactivation in carrier females have demonstrated preferential inactivation of the chromosome bearing the abnormal allele in a variety of tissues [ 2], and this skewing of X - inactivation is thought to explain the mild phenotype observed in carriers.

Within the large nuclei of these TGCs, the typical nuclear association of Atrx with blocks of pericentromeric heterochromatin [ 15] was clearly observable.

Thus, although random X - inactivation occurs normally within the epiblast, the AtrxWT allele ( inherited on the Xp chromosome) escaped the normal imprinted X - inactivation in the extraembryonic compartment of some carrier females.	"X	22	23	GO_ontology"	"chromosome	116	126	GO_ontology"	"X	157	158	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""X"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""chromosome"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""X"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
In both of these cases, other genes on the paternal X chromosome must be inactivated and remain so, since blocking inactivation of the entire Xp chromosome causes embryonic lethality due to biallelic expression of X - linked genes in the trophoblast [ 39].
