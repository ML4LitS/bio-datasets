The three members of the vertebrate TIF1 family ( alpha, beta, and gamma) are large nuclear proteins that each contain an N - terminal RBCC or TRIM domain ( Reymond et al. 2001) composed of a RING finger, two B - boxes, and a coiled - coil domain.

TIF1 alpha has been shown to associate with a variety of ligand - bound nuclear hormone receptors ( Le Douarin et al. 1995) and function as a coactivator for retinoic acid receptors ( Zhong et al. 1999).	"nuclear	72	79	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
In contrast, TIF1 gamma does not associate directly with either nuclear receptors or KRAB domains that bind to the other TIF1 family members ( Venturini et al. 1999; Abrink et al. 2001).

This provides further support for the hypothesis that Tif1 gamma acts within novel nuclear foci, during erythroid differentiation.	"nuclear	83	90	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"

By creating a C57BL / 6 congenic strain carrying a 129 - derived Chromosome 1 segment, we found that this 129 interval was sufficient to mediate the loss of tolerance to nuclear antigens, which had previously been attributed to a disrupted gene.

We chose this targeted gene in particular to study since the Apcs gene is located on Chromosome 1, approximately 94 cM from the centromere, within a region where several lupus - susceptibility loci, designated Sle1 ( Morel et al. 2001), Nba2 ( Drake et al. 1995; Vyse et al. 1997), and Bxs3 ( Hogarth et al. 1998; Haywood et al. 2000), have been mapped in NZW, NZB, and BXSB lupus - prone strains, respectively.

As previously reported ( Botto et al. 1998), the wild - type ( 129 x C57BL / 6) F2 mice developed lupus traits with elevated levels of auto - Abs, starting from 6 mo of age ( data not shown), and histological evidence of proliferative glomerulonephritis.

However, in contrast to our original findings, the levels of the other two disease serological markers analysed ( anti - single - stranded DNA [ ssDNA] and anti - double - stranded DNA [ dsDNA] Abs) and the severity of the renal pathology were not different between the two experimental groups.

We compared the levels of these auto - Abs between all ( 129 x C57BL / 6) F2. Apcs - / - mice and a group of 33 wild - type mice that were selected for being homozygous 129 in the region of Chromosome 1 between microsatellites D1Mit105 and D1Mit 223 ( 80 - 106 cM) ( Figure 6A - 6D).

A genomic region between D3Mit40 and D3Mit13, with an estimated peak at position approximately 51 cM, showed a significant linkage to ANA production and weaker linkages to anti - ssDNA and anti - chromatin production ( see Table 3; Figure 7).

We investigated further the effects of genes from the C57BL / 6 background by repeating the linkage analysis in ( 129 x C57BL / 6) F2 mice, whilst controlling for the very strong 129 effect on distal Chromosome 1, as previously described ( Zeng 1994).

We generated a C57BL / 6 congenic line carrying the telomeric region of Chromosome 1 from the 129 mouse strain, in order to dissect the complex polygenic disease phenotype of the ( C57BL / 6 x 129 / Sv) F2 hybrid strain into its individual genetic components.

Female Chromosome 1 congenic mice ( C57BL / 6. 129 [ D1Mit105 - 223]), together with sex - matched Apcs - / - mice backcrossed onto C57BL / 6 for ten generations ( C57BL / 6.

At 1 y of age, all animals were sacrificed, the auto - Abs assessed, and the renal histology examined.	"Abs	55	58	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Abs"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
As previously reported ( Bickerstaff et al. 1999), the levels of auto - Abs were markedly increased in the C57BL / 6. Apcs - / - compared to the wild - type C57BL / 6 controls.	"Abs	72	75	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Abs"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
However, the C57BL / 6. 129 ( D1Mit105 - 223) animals also expressed high levels of auto - Abs, and these titres were not different from those detected in the matched congenic mice containing a null mutation of the Apcs gene.	"Abs	91	94	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Abs"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
These results clearly demonstrated that epistatic interactions between 129 loci on Chromosome 1 and C57BL / 6 genes were sufficient to mediate the loss of tolerance to nuclear autoantigens.

We also developed a congenic mouse strain bearing a portion of 129 Chromosome 1 on a C57BL / 6 background and showed that this wild - type congenic line expressed striking anti - nuclear autoimmunity.

For each, there has to be a question as to whether the anti - nuclear autoimmunity is due to the gene - targeted mutant gene or to the normal 129 genes expressed in the same region as the targeted gene.

In MRL / Mp mice, the presence of the lpr gene accelerates the development of high level and broad - spectrum auto - Ab production and lethal glomerulonephritis, in addition to marked lymphoproliferative disease.	"Ab	117	119	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Ab"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
In contrast, homozygosity of the lpr gene in other strains such as C57BL / 6, AKR, LG / J, and C3H leads only to auto - Ab production ( Izui et al. 1984).	"Ab	120	122	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Ab"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
We demonstrated that a 129 - derived segment of Chromosome 1 was strongly linked to the expression of auto - Abs.	"Abs	109	112	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Abs"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
This region is probably capable of causing the initiation of a humoral autoimmune response to nuclear antigens; however, this response does not occur in the absence of C57BL / 6 genes.	"nuclear	94	101	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
In support of this, we identified a C57BL / 6 segment on Chromosome 3, which may interact with the 129 genes on Chromosome 1 to mediate the loss of tolerance.	"Chromosome	57	67	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Chromosome"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
The impact that these interacting loci may have on the lupus - like disease present in several gene - targeted animals was further assessed by comparing Apcs - / - mice with Chromosome 1 genetically matched controls.	"Chromosome	174	184	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Chromosome"", ""start_span"": 174, ""end_span"": 184, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
We have previously reported that ( 129 x C57BL / 6). Apcs - / - mice spontaneously produce a wide range of ANAs and develop significant immune complex glomerulonephritis ( Bickerstaff et al. 1999).	"immune complex	136	150	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""immune complex"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
On the basis of these observations, it was postulated that Apcs, by altering the clearance of chromatin, contributes to the pathogenesis of SLE.	"chromatin	94	103	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""chromatin"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
These findings, taken together, indicated that the phenotype associated with Apcs deficiency was caused by the presence of unaltered 129 genes from the telomeric region of Chromosome 1 operating in the C57BL / 6 genomic background.	"telomeric region of Chromosome	152	182	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""telomeric region of Chromosome"", ""start_span"": 152, ""end_span"": 182, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Using this approach, we demonstrated that the 129 interval on distal Chromosome 1, when transferred onto the C57BL / 6 genome, a combination commonly created by backcrossing onto C57BL / 6 a mutated gene located in that chromosomal region, was sufficient to mediate the production of auto - Abs.	"Abs	291	294	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Abs"", ""start_span"": 291, ""end_span"": 294, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Similar conclusions may apply to other gene - targeted animals carrying mutations of genes mapped in the 129 - derived susceptibility allele on Chromosome 7 ( O ' Keefe et al. 1996, 1999).	"Chromosome	144	154	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Chromosome"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
The expression of anti - nuclear autoimmunity was identical comparing the congenic with the Apcs - / - mice.	"nuclear	25	32	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
In support of this, the expression of the human C - reactive protein, an acute - phase protein closely related to Apcs, has been shown to delay the onset and severity of lupus nephritis in the NZB / W strain by preventing the deposition of immune complexes in the renal cortex ( Szalai et al. 2003).

In vitro, it has been shown that the Ptdsr can mediate the uptake of apoptotic cells and that such Ptdsr - mediated phagocytosis can be inhibited through addition of PS liposomes, the PS - binding molecule annexin V or an anti - Ptdsr antibody [ 26].

Other studies that connect the postnatal elimination of apoptotic photoreceptor cells to Ptdsr - mediated macrophage engulfment [ 43] should be interpreted with extreme caution as these studies were based on the monoclonal anti - Ptdsr antibody mAb 217G8E9 [ 26, 43] ( see below).

This is especially important in light of recent findings that demonstrated nuclear localization of the Ptdsr protein [ 29].	"nuclear	75	82	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"

At other locations, joints had clearly formed but showed dramatic loss of staining with the cartilage matrix marker Alcian blue ( Figure 3B - 3E) ( unpublished data).	"matrix	102	108	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""matrix"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
At this stage, the Gdf5 gene is normally expressed in stripes that mark the sites of joint formation ( Figure 4F), and the gene for the major collagen protein of cartilage matrix ( Col2a1) is down - regulated in the interzone region ( Figure 4E).	"matrix	172	178	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""matrix"", ""start_span"": 172, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
At birth, digit joints were generally indistinguishable from those in control animals; chondrocytes were abundant in articular regions and were surrounded by typical cartilage matrix with normal staining by Safranin O, a histological stain for proteoglycans ( Figure 5).	"matrix	176	182	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""matrix"", ""start_span"": 176, ""end_span"": 182, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
At this stage, both wild - type and mutant cells in articular regions also expressed high levels of Col2a1 and Aggrecan ( Agg), the genes encoding the major structural proteins of cartilage matrix ( Figure 5B and 5G) ( unpublished data).	"matrix	190	196	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""matrix"", ""start_span"": 190, ""end_span"": 196, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Together, these data suggest that BMPR1A activity is required in postnatal joint articular cartilage to maintain expression of many genes encoding structural components of cartilage matrix.	"components of cartilage matrix	158	188	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""components of cartilage matrix"", ""start_span"": 158, ""end_span"": 188, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Notably, despite reduced expression of many cartilage matrix marker genes in Bmpr1a mutant mice, the SOX9 protein was present at normal levels in articular regions at all stages examined, including newborn, 2 - wk - old, 7 - wk - old, and 9 - mo - old mice ( Figure 5N and 5S) ( unpublished data).	"matrix	54	60	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""matrix"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"

All markers of cartilage matrix looked similar to controls at E16. 5, suggesting that early stages of joint formation were not disrupted ( unpublished data).	"matrix	25	31	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""matrix"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
In our experiments, articular cartilage lacking Bmpr1a retains some normal characteristics, in that it maintains a very low proliferation rate, does not express Col1a1, and continues to express SOX9, a major transcription factor regulating expression of structural components of cartilage matrix.	"components of cartilage matrix	265	295	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""components of cartilage matrix"", ""start_span"": 265, ""end_span"": 295, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
However, several of the most prominent structural components of cartilage matrix fail to be maintained in mutant animals, resulting in decreased synthesis of Col2a1, Agg, and proteoglycans.	"components of cartilage matrix	50	80	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""components of cartilage matrix"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Therefore, BMPR1A appears to maintain articular cartilage primarily through inducing expression of key ECM components.	"ECM components	103	117	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""ECM components"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
In addition, close examination of the order of genes induced during chicken digit formation reveals that Sox9 turns on first, followed by Bmpr1b with L - Sox5, and then Sox6 and the cartilage matrix structural components Col2a1 and Agg ( Chimal - Monroy et al. 2003).	"matrix structural components	192	220	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""matrix structural components"", ""start_span"": 192, ""end_span"": 220, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
These results, together with the altered pattern of gene expression seen in our Bmpr1a - deficient mice, suggest that BMPR1A signaling may normally act to stimulate SOX9 by post - translational protein modification, or to induce L - Sox5 or Sox6 in cartilage to maintain expression of ECM components.

Mice deficient in NT - 3, its tyrosine kinase receptor, TrkC, or in TrkC - positive neuron - specific transcription factor Runx3 display severe ataxia associated with the absence of muscle spindles, and loss of proprioceptive neurons in dorsal root ganglia ( DRGs) or their axons ( Ernfors et al. 1994; Klein et al. 1994; Tessarollo et al. 1994; Fari n as et al. 1996; Liebl et al. 1997; Inoue et al. 2002; Levanon et al. 2002).

In the chicken embryo, limb ablations or anti - NT - 3 antibody injections into limb buds lead to elimination of TrkC - positive neurons and decreased innervation of motor neurons ( Oakley et al. 1995, 1997).

Proprioceptive axons in mice enter the gray matter in the spinal cord and advance ventrally parallel to the midline by E13 and reach the motor neurons by E15 ( Ozaki and Snider 1994).

DRG axons began extending towards the localized NT - 3 source by the end of the first day and consistently displayed a strong chemoattraction by 3 d in vitro, whereas they did not show such preference for BSA - loaded control beads ( Figure 5A and 5B).	"axons	4	9	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""axons"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Axons of these ganglia also showed strong chemoattraction towards the NT - 3 beads ( Figure 5D).	"Axons	0	5	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Axons"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
There was still preferred growth towards the bead at 1, 200 mu m, the longest distance studied, although the number of axons and the extent of growth were not as robust.	"axons	119	124	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""axons"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"

NT - 3 is therefore capable of acting as a chemoattractant for DRG axons.	"axons	67	72	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""axons"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Relatively few studies have implicated NT - 3 as a chemoattractant agent for sensory and motor axons.	"axons	95	100	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""axons"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"

However, earlier findings of normal proprioceptive afferent trajectories in chicken embryos despite injection of function - blocking NT - 3 antibody into the spinal cord ( Oakley et al. 1995) led them to discount this possibility.

In that study, though, assays on the effectiveness of antibody perturbation on NT - 3 - dependent cell survival showed that effectiveness was significant ( approximately 90%) but not complete ( Oakley et al. 1995).

( 1997) argue that while central sensory axons may still navigate properly in the absence of NT - 3, ectopic expression of NT - 3 disrupts their targeting.	"axons	41	46	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""axons"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Recently, another member of the neurotrophin family, BDNF, has been suggested to act as a chemoattractant for sensory axons innervating ear ( Tessarollo et al. 2004).	"axons	118	123	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""axons"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
It appears that peripheral NT - 3 alone is sufficient for rescuing proprioceptive neurons in NT - 3 KO animals and proper axonal pathfinding in the spinal cord.	"axonal	122	128	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""axonal"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Presently, it is not clear whether TrkC protein is also made by cutaneous afferents and if so at what stage in development this receptor is expressed by cutaneous axons.	"axons	163	168	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""axons"", ""start_span"": 163, ""end_span"": 168, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Based on the available evidence showing that all proprioceptive neurons are eliminated in NT - 3 or TrkC null mice, we think that TrkC staining in the tibial nerve mostly represents proprioceptive axons in the vicinity of their peripheral target.

Altogether, our findings suggest a role for NT - 3 in initiation of muscle innervation and spindle differentiation by the proprioceptive axons.	"axons	137	142	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""axons"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
We have examined nine Bax / NT - 3 double KO cases, and often incomplete DiI labeling gives the impression that there are no axons reaching the ventral spinal cord.	"axons	125	130	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""axons"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
It is highly possible that a small but considerable number of DRG cells express the transcription factor Er81 and that their axons grow beyond the intermediate levels of the spinal cord in Bax / NT - 3 double KO mice.

Patel et al. argue that since motor neurons are absent in these mice, NT - 3 secreted by them could not be a signal for proprioceptive axons to enter the lateral motor columns.	"axons	135	140	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""axons"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
This response is seen in WT, Bax null and in p75 null DRG explants, and in the absence of any other neurotrophins or target - derived axon guidance molecules.	"axon	134	138	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""axon"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Furthermore, in vitro, sensory axon response to NT - 3 does not appear to be dose - dependent ( Ringstedt et al. 1997; Tucker et al. 2001).	"axon	31	35	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""axon"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Along the monosynaptic stretch reflex pathway, only Wnt - 3 has been implicated as an axon arborization factor in the spinal cord ( Krylova et al. 2002).	"axon	86	90	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""axon"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Another molecule, Slit2, expressed in the midline and by motor neurons ( Wang et al. 1999) is capable of inducing axonal branching ( Nguyen Ba - Charvet et al. 2001; O zdinler and Erzurumlu 2002).	"axonal	114	120	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""axonal"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
DRG neurons express Robo receptors, which bind to Slits, and proprioceptive axons are therefore capable of responding to Slit signals ( Wang et al. 1999).	"axons	76	81	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""axons"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Thus, Slit2 might also be involved in terminal branching of propioceptive axons in the ventral cord and in the midline branching observed in our double KOs.	"axons	74	79	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""axons"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Lack of PV expression in Bax / NT - 3 KO mice suggests that PV expression might be responsible for proper axon targeting and muscle spindle differentiation.	"axon	106	110	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""axon"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
However, no defects in axon pathfinding along the monosynaptic reflex arc or in muscle spindle differentiation have been noted in PV KO mice, which develop normally and show no apparent changes in their behavior or physical activity ( Schwaller et al. 1999).	"axon	23	27	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""axon"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
These observations suggest that axonal targeting defects in Bax / NT - 3 double KO mice cannot be simply due to lack of PV expression in proprioceptive cells.	"axonal	32	38	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""axonal"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"

Whereas most of DNA helicases of this group, including simian virus 40 large T - antigen ( 6), Escherichia coli DnaB ( 7) and Archaeal Mcm ( 4, 8, 9), are composed of a single subunit, the active eukaryotic Mcm helicases are composed of two trimeric Mcm4 / 6 / 7 proteins ( 10 - 14).

While Mcm4, Mcm6 and Mcm7 proteins make distinct contribution to its helicase activity ( 11 - 13), Mcm2 or Mcm3 / 5 inhibit the helicase activity of the Mcm4 / 6 / 7 complex by converting its double trimer structure into a heterotetramer or heteropentamer, respectively ( 3, 11).

Recently, we reported that the helicase and ATP hydrolysis activities of mammalian Mcm4 / 6 / 7 are specifically activated by single - stranded DNA containing stretches of thymine residues and proposed a novel model that Mcm may play a crucial role in selection of replication origins in higher eukaryotes ( 13).

The substrate ( 5 fmol) was first incubated with indicated amount of the Mcm4 / 6 / 7 complex at 37 degrees C for 1 h in reaction mixture as described ( 11), and then reactions were stopped by addition of EDTA ( 20 mM), SDS ( 0. 1%) and 2 mu g proteinase K, followed by incubation for 20 min.

The above results suggest that Mcm4 / 6 / 7 generates a double hexameric complex on a bubble, each hexamer of which makes symmetric contact with the 5 ' - proximal central single - stranded segment.	"complex	73	80	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""complex"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
This predicts that the single - stranded segment needs to be of a sufficient length in order to accommodate the Mcm complex.	"Mcm complex	112	123	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm complex"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"

Bub - 10 generated only a low level of complexes with Mcm4 / 6 / 7, and Bub - 20 generated primarily a single mobility - shifted form, which may contain a single hexamer of Mcm4 / 6 / 7.

On Bub - 30, significant amount of complexes containing a double hexamer were generated in addition to those containing a single hexamer ( Figure 2A) ( 13, 21).	"complexes	35	44	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""complexes"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
The results indicate that a single - stranded segment of at least 40 nt long is required for efficient loading of the double - hexameric Mcm helicase on a bubble substrate.

In DNA helicase assays, Mcm4 / 6 / 7 complex did not show helicase activity on either Bub - 10 or Bub - 20 substrate.	"complex	37	44	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""complex"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Since Mcm4 / 6 / 7 can bind to Bub66 / T - G - rich and forms a double hexameric complex ( data not shown), the defective unwinding is not due to inefficient loading of the helicase onto the substrate.

If one hexamer interacting with the thymine - rich strand dissociates from the other hexamer and displaces only one of the duplex segments, then it would result in generation of Y - fork structures which could not be further displaced due to the presence of G - rich 3 ' - tail and would appear on the gel.

These findings indicate that the Mcm4 / 6 / 7 complex is loaded onto DNA preferentially and efficiently through single - stranded region, regardless of the presence of 3 ' - or 5 ' - terminus.	"complex	46	53	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""complex"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Absence of helicase actions on A - fork [ 3 ', 5 '] composed only of duplex regions is expected since double - stranded DNA is not able to activate the ATPase activity of Mcm4 / 6 / 7 ( 10).	"fork	35	39	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""fork"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
These results indicate that the Mcm4 / 6 / 7 complex binds to single - stranded DNA and that its helicase is activated only in the presence of a single - stranded 3 ' - tail.	"complex	45	52	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""complex"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Furthermore, dT - tailed 5 ' - extension, to which Mcm4 / 6 / 7 could bind, was not displaced by the Mcm helicase.	"Mcm helicase	101	113	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm helicase"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
The addition of the 5 ' - tail to dT - tailed 3 ' - extension further stimulated the displacement ( Figure 5D), confirming the previous report that the fork structures facilitate the helicase action.	"fork structures	152	167	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""fork structures"", ""start_span"": 152, ""end_span"": 167, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Thus, these results further strengthen our conclusion that the mammalian Mcm helicase is generally activated by the thymine - stretch on the 3 ' - single - stranded tail.

We next examined more systematically the effect of the compositions of the thymine residues of the 3 ' - tail on the Mcm helicase activity.	"Mcm helicase	117	129	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm helicase"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Increase of thymine content on the 3 ' - tail did not further increase the extent of unwinding ( 37 - TTTA13, 37 - TTTTA10 and 37 - T50; Figure 6A), suggesting that 17 repeats of TT dinucleotides ( 67% thymine) may be sufficient for activation of Mcm helicase.	"Mcm helicase	247	259	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm helicase"", ""start_span"": 247, ""end_span"": 259, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
It should be noted that the TA25 tail would self - anneal and this would prevent the loading of Mcm, since the 3 ' - tail containing TTAA13 or TTTAAA8 did not enhance the unwinding either ( data not shown).	"Mcm	96	99	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Thus, the minimal thymine content required for activation of the Mcm helicase may be somewhere between 33 and 50%.	"Mcm helicase	65	77	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm helicase"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"

Our previous studies have shown that the sequences containing periodic ( dT) n tracts derived from the human lamin B2 origin ( 48% thymine content) can serve as an efficient activator for the Mcm helicase on a bubble, and replacement of thymines with guanines abolished the helicase activation ( 13, 28).	"Mcm helicase	192	204	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm helicase"", ""start_span"": 192, ""end_span"": 204, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
In order to examine other natural replication origins with different thymine contents for the ability to activate Mcm helicase on a bubble substrate, we constructed new bubble substrates, Bub82 / c - myc, containing sequences derived from the DUE ( DNA unwinding element) region of the human c - myc origin which is essential for c - myc replicator activity ( 29, 30).	"Mcm helicase	114	126	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm helicase"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Mcm4 / 6 / 7 unwound Bub82 / lamin B2 ( thymine 48%), Bub82 / c - myc / DUE ( 37%) and Bub82 / c - myc / DUE - C ( 39%) with similar efficiency ( Figure 7A), indicating that the sequences from the c - myc origin also can serve as efficient activators of the Mcm helicase.	"Mcm helicase	258	270	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm helicase"", ""start_span"": 258, ""end_span"": 270, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
This result also indicates that sequences with 37% thymine content can activate Mcm4 / 6 / 7 to displace 24 nt duplex on both sides in a bubble substrate, suggesting that the not only thymine content but also the sequence context may affect the Mcm helicase activation.	"Mcm helicase	245	257	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm helicase"", ""start_span"": 245, ""end_span"": 257, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
This was also indicated by our previous results that guanine and cytosine stretches can bind to Mcm but cannot activate the helicase ( 13).	"Mcm	96	99	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"

In gel shift assays, Mcm4 / 6 / 7 bound to these Y - fork substrates with identical affinity ( Figure 8A), consistent with the notion that the Mcm4 / 6 / 7 binds to single - stranded tails.

However, in DNA helicase assays, T - fork / ( C: G) 49 was hardly displaced by Mcm4 / 6 / 7, but was readily displaced by SV40 T - antigen DNA helicase ( Figure 8B).	"fork	37	41	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""fork"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
In contrast, displacement was inhibited over the GC - rich segments on the latter substrate ( Figure 8D, right panel), although displacement up to 250 nt in length, albeit at a reduced level, was observed at a high concentration of Mcm4 / 6 / 7 complex.

In order to distinguish these two possibilities, we designed a new T - fork substrate containing inosine ( I) residue instead of guanosine residue.	"fork	71	75	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""fork"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"

Mcm4 / 6 / 7 hardly displaced the 31 nt long duplex of GCC: CGG repeats, whereas the T - fork / ( GAA: CTT) 10 was displaced efficiently, as described above.	"fork	89	93	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""fork"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"

In this report, we have conducted detailed analyses on binding and helicase actions of mouse Mcm4 / 6 / 7 using various substrates including fork and bubble structures.	"fork and bubble structures	141	167	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""fork and bubble structures"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 167, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Helicases are loaded onto replication forks through the melted region, induced by initiator binding, in bacteria ( 32).	"replication forks	26	43	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""replication forks"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
We previously reported that Mcm4 / 6 / 7 can be loaded onto a bubble - like structure and can serve as a DNA helicase at the forks ( 13).	"forks	125	130	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""forks"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
The ability of Mcm4 / 6 / 7 to unwind the bubble substrate but not the conventional duplex DNA ( Figures 2 and 13) indicates that Mcm can be loaded through the single - stranded segment of the bubble.	"Mcm	15	18	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Furthermore, the Mcm4 / 6 / 7 complex displays marked preference for thymine - rich sequences within the single - stranded segment for helicase activation ( 13).	"complex	30	37	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""complex"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
The results in this report indicate that helicase action of Mcm4 / 6 / 7 on synthetic bubbles may depend on the presence of an unpaired region of sufficient length ( at least 40 nt), which may permit assembly of a double - hexameric complex on the substrate DNA, similar to SV40 T - antigen protein ( Figure 2A) ( 21).	"complex	233	240	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""complex"", ""start_span"": 233, ""end_span"": 240, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
The ability of the mouse Mcm4 / 6 / 7 to unwind 3 ' - extension is shared by the archaeal Mcm helicase but not by Mcm4 / 6 / 7 from S. pombe and S. cerevisiae ( 14, 26, 27).	"Mcm helicase	90	102	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm helicase"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
While yeast Mcm helicases can translocate on duplex DNA, such activity was not observed with mammalian Mcm4 / 6 / 7 ( data not shown).	"Mcm helicases	12	25	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm helicases"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Occurrence of AT - rich sequences, with asymmetric distribution of adenine and thymine, near the replication origins, lead us to propose that Mcm may play a role in selection of initiation sites of mammalian DNA replication, and prompted us to examine the ability of sequences from human replication origins to activate Mcm4 / 6 / 7 helicase.	"Mcm	142	145	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Both lamin - B2 and c - myc origins served as efficient activator for Mcm helicase in vitro.	"Mcm helicase	70	82	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm helicase"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Consistent with it, site - specific loading of Mcm in the DNA replication initiation zone of the c - myc was recently reported ( 33).	"Mcm	47	50	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
We have examined in detail the effect of sequence context of the single - stranded DNA on the helicase activity of Mcm.	"Mcm	115	118	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Thus, we have concluded that Mcm4 / 6 / 7 helicase is most efficiently activated by non - structured single - stranded DNA with thymine content of 50% or more, although significant stimulation is observed also by DNA with less thymine content ( Figure 7), suggesting that the sequence specificity for Mcm helicase activation is rather relaxed and that the extent of the activation may depend on the sequence context.

The specific requirement of single - stranded thymine residues for activation of Mcm helicase prompted us to examine whether they are required also for processive unwinding of duplex DNA.	"Mcm helicase	81	93	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm helicase"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Our results indicated that increase of GC pair in the duplex segment significantly inhibited the Mcm helicase activity.	"Mcm helicase	97	109	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm helicase"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Duplex DNA composed only of GC pairs ( 10 repeats of CGG) on a Y - fork was not displaced at all, while the same template was readily displaced by SV40 T - antigen ( Figure 8B).	"fork	67	71	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""fork"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Mcm helicase was inhibited by the presence of GC - rich duplex segment also on a circular single - stranded partial heteroduplex substrate.	"Mcm helicase	0	12	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm helicase"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Thus, the difference of helicase actions may reflect the efficiency of Mcm loading.	"Mcm	71	74	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Alternatively, the presence of ' random ' sequence at the initially unwound duplex segment in the former template may engage the Mcm helicase in a more active conformation which can displace the GC - rich duplex segment.

Replacement of the central guanosine with inosine in the CGG repeat duplex DNA resulted in displacement ( Figure 8E) ( 31), suggesting that the continuous presence of AT base pair may not be essential for the Mcm helicase function and that the thermostability of GC base pairs is inhibitory for helicase action of Mcm4 / 6 / 7.

We propose that, only when both hexamers are activated by the interacting thymine - rich sequences present within the melted region, the Mcm helicase is mobilized and initiation takes place.

Diminished response to dDAVP, diminished abundance of mature glycosylated protein in mutant animals, and the transport of a fraction of mutant protein beyond the ER in MDCK cells are all consistent with the notion that AQP2 - F204V misfolding is limited and that it may retain some residual water transporting activity.

In fact, the most likely candidates for a cellular correlate of olfactory memory appear to be the neuronal connections in the piriform cortex due to the associational connectivity [ 5] and the expression of several forms of cellular and synaptic plasticity [ 7, 20 - 23].

Such contrast enhancement may rest in large part on the particular properties of dendrodendritic synapses between the principal output neurons ( mitral cells) and local inhibitory neurons ( granule cells) of the olfactory bulb.

In these distinct synapses, lateral and recurrent inhibition mediated by the gamma - aminobutyric acid - A system may be controlled by the activity of the closely appositioned glutamatergic part, perhaps triggering increased gamma - aminobutyric acid release by Ca2 + influx through glutamate - gated receptor channels ( [ 38]; see also [ 39]).	"synapses	18	26	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""synapses"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Moreover, the ablation of GluR - B, but also changes in the extent of Q / R site editing of GluR - B, can alter the strength of excitatory synaptic transmission in the genetically addressed neuronal populations [ 51, 58, 60], thus potentially shifting the balance of excitatory and inhibitory transmission in the affected circuits.

The milder phenotype upon GluR - B depletion could be attributed to reduced AMPAR densities at synapses [ 40, 41] and therefore probably to a lesser extent of Ca2 + influx.	"synapses	95	103	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""synapses"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"

Only the FA fraction revealed a small dox - resistant pool of peptide in acutely treated animals that we believe represents stable predeposit aggregates that have already accumulated by 4 wk of age when treatment was begun ( Figure 2C).

Cortical homogenates were sequentially extracted to separate peptide into PBS -, SDS -, and FA - soluble fractions, then transgene - derived A beta 40 and A beta 42 were measured by human - specific ELISA [ 23].

In all animals harboring amyloid deposits, we found that the vast majority of A beta ( > 99%) was extracted into the SDS and FA fractions ( Figure 5A and 5B).	"fractions	128	137	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""fractions"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
This latter finding indicates that compared to other disease - associated protein aggregates such as mutant huntingtin, which clear in less than 3 mo [ 32], the disaggregation of extracellular amyloid is relatively slow.

Peripheral antibody injection decreases amyloid load more broadly, and although it does not appear to act as quickly as local injection, can significantly reduce amyloid load within 2 mo of initial treatment [ 52, 53].

Careful study of the mechanism behind several of the antibody - mediated therapies has suggested that activated microglia play an important role in the removal of fibrillar plaques after immunization [ 50, 52, 55].

It is, nevertheless, possible that lack of microglia activation is the major difference between the slow clearance described here, where no perturbation of the immune system is expected, and the rapid clearance described in studies involving antibody or viral injection.

In isolation, mild activation of microglia by injection damage or opsinization may not be adequate to induce substantial phagocytosis, but when combined with an A beta - lowering agent, such as neprilysin or A beta - targeted antibodies, the two may work in concert to clear peptide deposits.

The effect of the cQTL on Chromosome 11 was in the same direction in both males and females, but was sex - biased toward a larger effect in females ( R2 = 0. 091 in females versus R2 = 0. 046 in males), confirming the minimal sex specificity of this cQTL.

The proportion of gene expression levels controlled by this locus ( approximated as the coefficients of determination R2) differs between males and females for the majority of the transcripts ( as in Figure 6A), and for Chromosome 19 ( Figure 6B), females demonstrated greater genetic regulation of gene expression than males.

Next we asked whether the Xpd + XPCS and Xpd + XP alleles, despite decreased mRNA levels, ameliorated TTD symptoms by increasing overall TFIIH levels in compound heterozygous XpdTTD / + XPCS and XpdTTD / + XP cells.

Previously, using comparative immunohistochemistry, we and others have shown an up to 70% reduction of TFIIH levels in primary fibroblasts from patients with TTD compared with wt controls due to reduced stability [ 16, 17].

Despite overexpression of mRNA from the XpdTTD allele relative to the wt allele ( Figure 1E), TFIIH protein levels were reduced by 50% in primary mouse XpdTTD / TTD fibroblasts ( Figure 4E and 4F), thereby mimicking the situation in human patients with TTD.	"TFIIH	94	99	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""TFIIH"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Consistent with low mRNA expression levels, neither the Xpd + XPCS nor the Xpd + XP allele was able to restore TFIIH abundance to wt levels in XpdTTD compound heterozygote cells ( Figure 4E and 4F).

Thus, the improved UV survival observed in compound heterozygote cells ( Figure 4A) and likely the rescue of TTD progeroid symptoms ( Figure 3) were not due to normalisation of TFIIH levels, suggesting a qualitative rather than a quantitative effect on these phenotypes in vivo.

Keeping in mind that the ~ 1, 200 alleles known to exist for the CTRF gene implicated in the common autosomal recessive disorder cystic fibrosis alone [ 29] can theoretically result in ~ 700, 000 different allelic combinations, the potential number of allelic combinations of different recessive mutations and single nucleotide polymorphisms genome - wide is currently incalculable.

While many studies have established the importance of DNA methylation in epigenetic reprogramming, recent data point to a crucial role of chromatin in this process [ 3 - 5].	"chromatin	138	147	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""chromatin"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 147, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"

Furthermore, p150CAF - 1 is required to ensure a replication - specific pool of HP1 molecules at replication sites in pericentric heterochromatin during mid - late S phase [ 16].

Here, we have analyzed the importance of CAF - 1 during early mouse development by genetic ablation and in ES cells by depletion using RNA interference ( RNAi).	"CAF - 1	41	48	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
We show that CAF - 1 is essential for viability in early mouse embryos and ES cells.	"CAF - 1	13	20	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Since chromatin architecture and higher - order structures are important for genome function [ 21], we decided to characterize this phenotype in more detail.	"chromatin	6	15	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""chromatin"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
For this purpose, we examined the status of heterochromatin organization between the two - cell and blastocyst stages.	"heterochromatin	44	59	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""heterochromatin"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"

These data evidence a key role for p150CAF - 1 during pre - implantation development, and reveal that this protein is required for the proper 3 - D organization of heterochromatin within embryonic cell nuclei.

Next, we wondered whether a similar requirement for CAF - 1 could also be observed in ES cells, which are derived from the blastocyst inner cell mass.	"CAF - 1	52	59	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Surprisingly, we did not observe this severe alteration in heterochromatin organization in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs) following p150CAF - 1 depletion by RNAi.	"heterochromatin	59	74	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""heterochromatin"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
p150CAF - 1 depletion in MEFs resulted in a strong inhibition of cell proliferation ( unpublished data), but did not alter the clustering of heterochromatin domains ( Figures 2C and S2).	"heterochromatin domains	141	164	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""heterochromatin domains"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 164, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Similarly, p150CAF - 1 depletion in 3T3 cells did not affect heterochromatin organization [ 16].	"heterochromatin	61	76	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""heterochromatin"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
These observations reveal a specific function for CAF - 1 in the early embryo and ES cells.	"CAF - 1	50	57	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
We could not detect any significant difference in the distribution and aspect of PML nuclear bodies between control and p150CAF - 1 - depleted ES cells ( Figure 2D).

Previous studies performed in mammalian cell lines showed that CAF - 1 activity is required for S phase progression [ 16, 23, 24].	"CAF - 1	63	70	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
We show here that 3 d after transfection of the RNAi vector, p150CAF - 1 - depleted cells ( identified by a complete absence of CAF - 1 IF signal) appear still active for replication, as revealed by incorporation of the thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine ( BrdU) ( Figure 3A), the PCNA ( proliferating cell nuclear antigen) pattern ( Figure 3B), and flow cytometry analysis ( Figure 3C).	"CAF - 1	65	72	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Hence, in these cells, DNA replication persists despite the drastic changes in heterochromatin organization.	"heterochromatin	79	94	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""heterochromatin"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Altogether, our data demonstrate that loss of p150CAF - 1 function in ES cells and early embryos alters first the organization of heterochromatin in the nucleus and, in a subsequent step, cell cycle and viability.

At the periphery of each pericentric domain, centric regions form individual entities ( Figure 4A).	"pericentric domain	25	43	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""pericentric domain"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
In p150CAF - 1 RNAi - depleted cells, we observed a disruption of pericentric heterochromatin clusters that coincides with the disappearance of DAPI - dense foci ( Figure 4B).	"pericentric heterochromatin	66	93	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""pericentric heterochromatin"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Individual pericentric domains from single chromosomes are now found either isolated or aggregated in a pattern less dense than the regular clusters observed in control cells ( Figure 4B).

Such aggregates, which are often found at the nuclear periphery, are also revealed by DAPI staining as a typical signature of p150CAF - 1 loss - of - function.	"nuclear	46	53	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
In conclusion, these results show that p150CAF - 1 is required for the proper condensation and clustering of pericentric heterochromatin domains.

In a second series of experiments, we compared the association of histone H3 with chromatin in nuclei isolated from cells transfected with control and p150CAF - 1 RNAi plasmid vectors.

In all conditions, the amount of histone H3 remaining associated with chromatin was indistinguishable in control and p150CAF - 1 - depleted ES cells ( unpublished data).	"chromatin	70	79	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""chromatin"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Our findings showed that the nuclear localization of HP1 alpha is severely altered in Chaf1a - / - embryos and p150CAF - 1 - depleted ES cells.	"nuclear	29	36	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
We therefore examined the status of other epigenetic marks previously shown to characterize pericentric heterochromatin.	"pericentric heterochromatin	92	119	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""pericentric heterochromatin"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Immunoprecipitation of minor satellite repeats in the same experiment was less affected ( Figure 7B), showing that loss of p150CAF - 1 function mainly affects H4K20me3 at pericentric heterochromatin.

This result shows that p150CAF - 1 contributes to normal levels of H4K20me3 at pericentric heterochromatin, but not necessarily at other loci.

Given the major defects observed in heterochromatin organization, it is tempting to speculate that these defects cause the developmental arrest in the embryos and death in ES cells.

In contrast, in undifferentiated cells that are already lineage committed ( such as MEFs) genome architecture might be more stable than in ES cells and thus cannot be disrupted by CAF - 1 depletion.

In mammals, H3K9 dimethylation is predominantly associated with H3. 1, but not with H3. 3, which carries modifications typically found in transcribed chromatin regions [ 39].

Outside of the centromeric H3 variant, S. cerevisiae possesses only H3. 3, which is expressed and incorporated into chromatin in a replication - independent fashion in higher eukaryotes [ 12].	"chromatin	116	125	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""chromatin"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"

While this has to be addressed experimentally, it is worthwhile to mention an alternate possible mechanism that might explain the disruption of heterochromatin domains in p150CAF - 1 null embryos and ES cells.

Following one or two rounds of DNA replication in the absence of p150CAF - 1, heterochromatin would become deprived of this molecule, which would cause the disruption of its 3 - D organization.

Analysis of mitotic cells with anti - phosphohistone 3 ( PH3) - specific antibodies confirmed that loss of E2f1, but not E2f2 or E2f3, suppressed ectopic division ( Figure S3).

( A) Horizontal retinal sections from mice of the indicated ages and genotypes were stained for nuclei ( DAPI, blue) and markers that detect ganglion cells ( Pou4f2, red), rods and cones ( Sag [ rod arrestin], green), and rod bipolar cells ( Prkca, green, and Cabp5, red).

Cones represent only 3% of photoreceptors and, unlike rods, develop without Rb, but they require rods for survival, and in the Rb KO retina, they have abnormal morphology and their synaptic targets, bipolar cells, are much depleted [ 2].

We first studied Calb2 ( calretinin), which marks a subset of amacrine and ganglion cell bodies as well as three tracks corresponding to their processes in the IPL ( Figure 3A).	"processes	143	152	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""processes"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
We quantified Calb2 + cell bodies in the Rb KO INL ( corresponding to amacrine cell staining only) and observed a reduction from P8 onwards ( Figures 3C and S6).	"cell bodies	22	33	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""cell bodies"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
( A) P18 horizontal sections of WT, Rb KO, and Rb / E2f1 DKO retina were stained for nuclei ( DAPI, blue), Calb2 ( green), and Slc18a3 ( red).	"nuclei	85	91	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""nuclei"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
( B) Confocal images of P30 horizontal sections of WT and Rb KO retina were stained for nuclei ( DAPI, blue), Chat and Slc18a3 ( both red), and Camk2a ( green).	"nuclei	88	94	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""nuclei"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Of the three Calb2 + tracks in the IPL, the two outer tracks are from SACs, named after their extensive dendritic - tree - like morphology [ 37].	"dendritic - tree	104	120	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""dendritic - tree"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Mature SAC processes stain specifically for Slc18a3 ( vesicular acetyl choline transporter, VAChT) [ 37], and, significantly, this marker was absent in the peripheral Rb KO or Rb / E2f1 DKO P18 retina ( Figures 3A and S7B).	"processes	11	20	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""processes"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Thus, Rb is not required for SAC survival or for process outgrowth, but rather it seems to regulate the expression and / or stability of Calb2, Calb1, Chat, Slc18a3, Sv2c, Kcnc1b, Kcnc2, and GABA in SACs, but leaves Camk2a expression virtually unaffected.

Rb / E2f3 DKO SAC tracks were slightly more disordered than in WT retina, most likely because of the absence of synaptic partner cells, which are killed by E2f1.	"synaptic	112	120	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""synaptic"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"

Analysis with the pan - E2f3 antibody ( sc - 878, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) detected a 55 - kD E2f3a species and a 40 - kD E2f3b polypeptide ( Figure 6).	"antibody	29	37	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""antibody"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"

Thus, among the cell cycle regulators we examined, most showed bivalent distribution, and E2f3b was unusual in its solely nuclear compartmentalization.	"nuclear	122	129	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Rb family and Tfdp proteins can also determine E2f localization [ 20 - 22], and we found that a portion of both Rb and Tfdp1 proteins are cytoplasmic in retinal cells.

Indeed, immunostaining revealed that Rb and E2f3 colocalize to SAC processes.	"processes	67	76	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""processes"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
E2f3a could disrupt SAC differentiation through its well known role as a transcriptional activator, or, in view of the discovery that it is partially cytoplasmic, E2f3a may affect processes other than gene regulation.	"cytoplasmic	150	161	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""cytoplasmic"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Both scenarios are feasible since E2fs regulate differentiation genes [ 44 - 48], and cell cycle regulators, such as Cdkn1b, have cytoplasmic activities that influence differentiation [ 68, 69].	"cytoplasmic	130	141	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""cytoplasmic"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
It may be difficult to identify E2f3a - specific target genes or cytoplasmic proteins in SACs since these neurons are a small proportion ( < 1%) of the total retina and only ~ 5. 2% of amacrine neurons [ 38].

However, the binding assays were performed in solution, and we have found that several of these mutants do bind E2f, albeit weakly, on chromatin ( T. Yu and R. B., unpublished data).
