Thus, in the extraembryonic compartment of AtrxWT / null carrier females, normal imprinted X - inactivation would be expected to result in silencing of the paternally derived AtrxWT allele, leaving only the Atrxnull allele on the active maternal X ( Xm) and thereby render the extraembryonic tissues null for full - length Atrx protein.

Specifically, CAF - 1 deposits the histone H3 variant H3. 1 into chromatin, in a pathway coupled to DNA synthesis, whereas a second histone chaperone, HIRA, is involved in the deposition of the H3. 3 variant in a DNA synthesis independent pathway [ 11, 12].
