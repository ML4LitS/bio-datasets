In order to substantiate the view that stria vascularis in Slc26a4 - / - secretes K +, we measured the magnitude of the bumetanide - sensitive current exiting stria vascularis across the apical membrane of strial marginal cells and determined the expression of the proteins KCNQ1, KCNE1 and SLC12A2, which are essential for K + secretion [ 20, 32, 33], and of GJB2 ( Cx26), which is thought to contribute to K + cycling [ 23].	apical membrane of strial marginal cells,187,227,GO_ontology	"[{""token"": ""apical membrane of strial marginal cells"", ""start_span"": 187, ""end_span"": 227, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"	train

Increase of thymine content on the 3 ' - tail did not further increase the extent of unwinding ( 37 - TTTA13, 37 - TTTTA10 and 37 - T50; Figure 6A), suggesting that 17 repeats of TT dinucleotides ( 67% thymine) may be sufficient for activation of Mcm helicase.

Occurrence of AT - rich sequences, with asymmetric distribution of adenine and thymine, near the replication origins, lead us to propose that Mcm may play a role in selection of initiation sites of mammalian DNA replication, and prompted us to examine the ability of sequences from human replication origins to activate Mcm4 / 6 / 7 helicase.

Thus, we have concluded that Mcm4 / 6 / 7 helicase is most efficiently activated by non - structured single - stranded DNA with thymine content of 50% or more, although significant stimulation is observed also by DNA with less thymine content ( Figure 7), suggesting that the sequence specificity for Mcm helicase activation is rather relaxed and that the extent of the activation may depend on the sequence context.
