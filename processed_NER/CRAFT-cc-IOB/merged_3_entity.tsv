To verify the dual locations of E2f3 and to determine which isoforms were present in retina, we analyzed nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions by Western blot at different times during development.	nuclear,105,112,GO_ontology	cytoplasmic,117,128,GO_ontology	fractions,129,138,GO_ontology	"[{""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""cytoplasmic"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""fractions"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"	test
Like E2f3a, Rb was present in both the WT cytoplasm and nucleus at P0, but at P18, when the levels of Rb had increased, it was primarily nuclear ( Figure 6).	cytoplasm,42,51,GO_ontology	nucleus,56,63,GO_ontology	nuclear,137,144,GO_ontology	"[{""token"": ""cytoplasm"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""nucleus"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"	test
E2f3a is both nuclear and cytoplasmic, but E2f3b is always nuclear.	nuclear,14,21,GO_ontology	cytoplasmic,26,37,GO_ontology	nuclear,59,66,GO_ontology	"[{""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""cytoplasmic"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"	test
The nuclear localization of E2f3b contrasts with that of other repressive E2fs in differentiating muscle, where E2f5 switches from the nucleus to cytoplasm, while E2f4 remains in both compartments [ 23].	nuclear,4,11,GO_ontology	nucleus,135,142,GO_ontology	cytoplasm,146,155,GO_ontology	"[{""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""nucleus"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""cytoplasm"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 155, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"	test
