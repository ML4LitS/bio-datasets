In the current study, the observation of a disorganized pattern of nuclei localized to the equatorial bow region of alphaA / BKO lenses, and nucleic acid staining of structures throughout the anterior cortex of 54 wk alphaA / BKO lenses, is consistent with a role for alpha - crystallin in the nucleus.

Immunofluorescence of mouse embryo fibroblast nuclei with the anti - Tif1 gamma antiserum demonstrates that Tif1 gamma is localized in small nuclear foci ( Figure 6A).

The nuclear foci that contain Tif1 gamma do not colocalize with two markers of heterochromatin, HP1 alpha protein and DAPI staining of DNA ( Figure 6A).

Furthermore, Tif1 gamma does not colocalize with promyelocytic leukemia gene product ( PML) nuclear bodies, DNA repair complexes that contain Mre11, or transcriptional complexes containing TFII - B ( unpublished data).

In two different murine erythroleukemia cell lines ( MEL and G1E), Tif1 gamma is also expressed in nuclear foci, and even though the overall Tif1 gamma protein level is reduced, this nuclear foci localization does not change with differentiation ( unpublished data).

Localization of Tif1 gamma to these nuclear bodies may be regulated by posttranslational modification such as SUMO modification that is required for PML to form PML nuclear domains ( Zhong et al. 2000a, 2000b; Best et al. 2002).

Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterised by the production of autoantibodies ( auto - Abs) against a wide spectrum of self - antigens, mainly from subcellular compartments, especially the cell nucleus.	"Abs	127	130	GO_ontology"	"nucleus	234	241	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Abs"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""nucleus"", ""start_span"": 234, ""end_span"": 241, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Guided by these observations, we investigated whether the increased levels of ANA and anti - chromatin Ab observed in the Apcs - / - mice were caused by a gene ( s) within the fixed 129 region surrounding the mutated Apcs gene, rather than caused by the mutated Apcs gene itself.	"chromatin	93	102	GO_ontology"	"Ab	103	105	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""chromatin"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""Ab"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
This result demonstrates that, most likely, the 129 - derived region and not the lack of Apcs was mediating the production of ANA and anti - chromatin Ab.

In contrast to these strong associations with disease serological markers, the QTL analysis identified only two potential linkages to glomerulonephritis: one in the wild - type mice on Chromosome 7 across a 10 cM region between D7Mit246 ( 15 cM) and D7Mit145 ( 26. 5 cM) of 129 origin ( LOD 2. 86, p = 0. 0013), and one on Chromosome 17 between D17Mit100 ( 11. 7 cM) and D17Mit216 ( 29. 4 cM) from the C57BL / 6 strain ( LOD 1. 3, p = 0. 049 and LOD 1. 67, p = 0. 021 in the wild - type and Apcs - / - mice, respectively).

By comparing this Chromosome 1 congenic strain with matched congenic mice lacking the Apcs gene, we demonstrated that serum amyloid P component deficiency influences the severity of glomerulonephritis, but is not the prime mover in the induction of anti - nuclear autoimmunity, contrary to our own original interpretation of our data ( Bickerstaff et al. 1999).

Similarly, the Y - chromosome - linked Yaa gene in BXSB and MRL / Mp males enhances the rapid development of auto - Abs and glomerulonephritis ( Izui et al. 1988; Merino et al. 1989).

In the context of SLE susceptibility, one of the most consistently mapped non - MHC regions of the mouse genome is the telomeric Chromosome 1 segment, where several disease loci, designated Sle1 ( Morel et al. 2001), Nba2 ( Drake et al. 1995; Rozzo et al. 1996; Vyse et al. 1997), and Bxs3 ( Hogarth et al. 1998), have been mapped in lupus - prone strains.

The human serum amyloid P component binds avidly to DNA, chromatin, and apoptotic cells in physiological conditions in vitro ( Pepys 1974; Pepys and Butler 1987; Butler et al. 1990) and also to exposed chromatin and apoptotic cells in vivo ( Hintner et al. 1988; Breathnach et al. 1989; Familian et al. 2001).

However, in this study we found that only ANA and anti - chromatin Ab levels were significantly increased in the ( 129 x C57BL / 6) F2. Apcs - / - mice.

Furthermore, the whole - genome analysis identified the 129 region surrounding the Apcs gene as the main locus contributing to the development of ANA and anti - chromatin Ab.

In agreement with this, when we carried out a selective comparison between the ( 129 x C57BL / 6) F2.

Axons that normally enter the gray matter through dorsal spinal cord grow towards the midline when presented with a localized NT - 3 source, and new axon growth towards the NT - 3 bead is initiated from DRGs, entering the spinal cord at ectopic loci at lateral mid - spinal cord ( Figure 6G).

While the phenotype of Er81 KO mice is quite dramatic, and most proprioceptive axons stop within the intermediate spinal cord, it is important to note that a few axons still find their way to the ventral spinal cord and target properly to the motor neurons ( Arber et al. 2000).

Our present results, along with those from transgenic mice with NT - 3 over - expression in ectopic regions of the spinal cord ( Ringstedt et al. 1997), argue for a role of NT - 3 in chemoattractant axon guidance of proprioceptive axons in the spinal cord.	"axon	199	203	GO_ontology"	"axons	231	236	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""axon"", ""start_span"": 199, ""end_span"": 203, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""axons"", ""start_span"": 231, ""end_span"": 236, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
NT - 3 is capable of attracting axons along distances of up to 1 mm in collagen gel matrix, covering the physiological range it needs to attract axons during development.	"axons	32	37	GO_ontology"	"axons	145	150	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""axons"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""axons"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Previous studies with exogenous or local applications of NT - 3 to developing primary sensory axons have indicated that this neurotrophin can attract and induce axonal branching ( Ulup i nar et al. 2000; O zdinler and Erzurumlu 2001, O zdinler et al. 2004).

Slit2 does not cause repulsion of NT - 3 - responsive DRG axons in vitro ( Nguyen Ba - Charvet et al. 2001), but causes ectopic branching and arborization of trigeminal axons in the brainstem ( O zdinler and Erzurumlu 2002).

NT - 3 most likely acts cooperatively with other axon guidance molecules or by regulating expression of yet to be identified proprioceptive neuron - specific receptors / ligands for numerous axon guidance cues.

Frozen spinal cord sections ( 10 mu m thick) were blocked and incubated in a cocktail of rabbit anti - TrkA and goat anti - TrkC antibodies ( gift of Dr. Reichardt; Huang et al. 1999), followed by a cocktail of CY3 conjugated donkey anti - rabbit and FITC conjugated donkey anti - goat antibodies ( Chemicon, Temecula, California, United States) in the presence of 0. 3% TritonX - 100 and 10% normal donkey serum.

Among the several stable subcomplexes which MCM proteins can generate, only the Mcm4 / 6 / 7 complex has been shown to possess an intrinsic DNA helicase activity ( 10 - 14, 17 - 18).	"MCM	44	47	GO_ontology"	"complex	93	100	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""MCM"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""complex"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and genetic characterization in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strongly suggested that Mcm is involved not only in initiation but also in the DNA chain elongation stage as a replicative helicase ( 19, 20).	"Chromatin	0	9	GO_ontology"	"Mcm	118	121	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Chromatin"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""Mcm"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Consistent with this notion, the processivity of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe and mouse Mcm4 / 6 / 7 complexes is significantly stimulated on forked DNA structures and it can unwind duplex DNA of 400 - 500 bp ( 13, 14).	"complexes	102	111	GO_ontology"	"forked	143	149	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""complexes"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""forked"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Mcm4 / 6 / 7 binds to fork and bubble structures in an ATP - dependent manner, and generates a double - hexameric complex, as was shown for T - antigen ( 13, 14, 21).	"fork and bubble structures	22	48	GO_ontology"	"complex	114	121	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""fork and bubble structures"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""complex"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
We specifically addressed sequence requirement for the Mcm helicase activation, mode of interaction with DNA substrates and whether the thymine sequences are required for continuous activation of Mcm helicase during the unwinding process.	"Mcm helicase	55	67	GO_ontology"	"Mcm helicase	196	208	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm helicase"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""Mcm helicase"", ""start_span"": 196, ""end_span"": 208, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
M13mp18 and M13mp19 single - stranded circular DNA, T4 polynucleotide kinase, DNase I and the Klenow fragment were from TAKARA, Nuclease P1 was from Roche, and anti - FLAG M2 Ab ( antibody) - agarose and FLAG peptide were from Sigma.

In fact, we previously showed that the Mcm4 / 6 / 7 mainly forms a single hexameric complex on bubble - 20 ( a bubble substrate with 20 nt long central single - stranded segment) and a double hexameric complex on bubble - 60 DNA ( 13).	"complex	84	91	GO_ontology"	"complex	202	209	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""complex"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""complex"", ""start_span"": 202, ""end_span"": 209, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
The amounts of double hexamer complexes increased on Bub - T40 and Bub - T50 with concomitant decrease of single hexamer complexes ( Figure 2A).	"complexes	30	39	GO_ontology"	"complexes	121	130	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""complexes"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""complexes"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Taken together, the above results are consistent with the notion that the Mcm4 / 6 / 7 complex, loaded onto DNA as a double hexameric complex, efficiently unwinds the duplex region of the substrate DNA.	"complex	87	94	GO_ontology"	"complex	134	141	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""complex"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""complex"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
In contrast, PriA helicase, used as a control, bound to A - fork [ 3 '] more efficiently than to A - fork [ 5 '], as reported previously ( 23, 25).	"fork	60	64	GO_ontology"	"fork	101	105	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""fork"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""fork"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Mcm4 / 6 / 7 bound also to 5 ' - extension and 3 ' - extension, albeit with slightly reduced affinity compared to A - fork [ 3 '] and A - fork [ 5 '] ( Figure 4A).	"fork	118	122	GO_ontology"	"fork	138	142	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""fork"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""fork"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Mcm4 / 6 / 7 bound to A - fork [ 3 ', 5 '] with much lower affinity, and the complex gave rise to a single band.	"fork	26	30	GO_ontology"	"complex	77	84	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""fork"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""complex"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
It has been reported that the 3 ' - extension can be unwound by the archaeal Mcm homohexamer but not by fission and budding yeast Mcm complexes ( 14, 26, 27).	"Mcm	77	80	GO_ontology"	"Mcm complexes	130	143	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""Mcm complexes"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Partial heteroduplex substrates containing the 3 ' - tail of TC25, TTCC13, TTTCCC8, TTTTCCCC6, TTCC17 were displaced by the Mcm4 / 6 / 7 complex to the extent similar to that achieved by TTA17, suggesting that 50% thymine content is sufficient for full activation of Mcm helicase.	"complex	137	144	GO_ontology"	"Mcm helicase	267	279	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""complex"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""Mcm helicase"", ""start_span"": 267, ""end_span"": 279, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
To address this issue, we constructed a series of T - tailed Y - fork structures ( T - fork) containing various sequences in the duplex segment.	"fork structures	65	80	GO_ontology"	"fork	87	91	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""fork structures"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""fork"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
When thymine or adenine is inserted as every third nucleotide ( repeats of CCT or CCA), the extent of unwinding increased ( T - fork / ( CCT: GGA) 16 and T - fork / ( CCA: GGT) 16).	"fork	128	132	GO_ontology"	"fork	158	162	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""fork"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""fork"", ""start_span"": 158, ""end_span"": 162, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
This result is consistent with that on Y - fork and indicates that GC - rich duplex segment is inhibitory for unwinding by the Mcm helicase.	"fork	43	47	GO_ontology"	"Mcm helicase	127	139	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""fork"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""Mcm helicase"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
T - fork / ( GCC: CIG) 10 was displaced with efficiency much greater than that of T - fork / ( GCC: CGG) 10, indicating that the thermostability of the duplex segment, not the lack of AT base pair, is responsible for inability of Mcm4 / 6 / 7 to displace the duplex.

At each fork, one Mcm4 / 6 / 7 complex is likely to encircle the single - stranded DNA strand and two hexamers may bind symmetrically to the bubble substrate, forming a double hexameric structure on the bubble ( see schematic drawing of Figure 1A).	"fork	8	12	GO_ontology"	"complex	31	38	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""fork"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""complex"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
The archaeal Mcm can unwind A - fork [ 3 '] but eukaryotic Mcm4 / 6 / 7 cannot, since the former binds to double - stranded DNA but the latter does not ( 5, 27).	"Mcm	13	16	GO_ontology"	"fork	32	36	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""fork"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
On the partial heteroduplex template, Mcm is loaded onto the circular single - stranded DNA of 6. 4 kb, while it is loaded onto the 50 nt long 3 ' - tail DNA on the Y - fork.	"Mcm	38	41	GO_ontology"	"fork	169	173	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""fork"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Prior to initiation of DNA replication, Mcm helicase may adopt a double hexameric complex at the partially melted origin region, and may catalyze concurrent unwinding of duplex DNA into both directions, while stably associated with the origins of DNA replication.	"Mcm helicase	40	52	GO_ontology"	"complex	82	89	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm helicase"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""complex"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
This process would involve melting of duplex DNA, which may be facilitated by binding of preRC components in the context of proper chromatin structures, or by other unwinding factors including a topoisomerase or a newly identified Mcm8 helicase ( 34 - 36).	"preRC	89	94	GO_ontology"	"chromatin structures	131	151	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""preRC"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""chromatin structures"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
This, in conjunction with the low processivity of Mcm4 / 6 / 7 helicase, strongly indicates that the replicative helicase at the replication forks would require more than Mcm4 / 6 / 7 complex.	"replication forks	129	146	GO_ontology"	"complex	184	191	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""replication forks"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""complex"", ""start_span"": 184, ""end_span"": 191, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
By the same token, huntingtin shuttles through the nucleus, where it is required for proper nuclear localization of its transcription factor partners, suggesting that huntingtin may play a role in transcription cascades in extraembryonic tissues that pattern the embryo [ 18].

The inherited forms are either X - linked as a consequence of mutation of the Avpr2 gene [ 2], or autosomal due to mutation of the Aqp2 gene [ 3].

Generally these proteins permit the passage of water through the plasma membrane ( PM) of cells, several of which carry out this role specifically in the process of water reabsorption from urine in the kidney.

Furthermore these proteins can also be differentially targeted to distinct regions of the PM; for example, AQP2 is routed to the apical membrane of cells surrounding the collecting duct, whereas other aquaporins ( AQP3 or 4) are inserted into the basolateral face.	"regions of the PM	75	92	GO_ontology"	"apical membrane of cells	129	153	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""regions of the PM"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""apical membrane of cells"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
For this process to occur, AVP binds its receptor, AVPR2, on the basolateral face of the collecting duct cells, leading to a rise in intracellular cAMP, ultimately resulting in phosphorylation of AQP2 at serine 256 by cAMP - dependent protein kinase [ 9] and its redistribution to the plasma membrane.

In humans, recessive alleles of Aqp2 are postulated to cause NDI because they do not properly translocate to the apical cell surface in response to AVP.

Upon stimulation with forskolin, a cAMP - dependent protein kinase activator, wild - type AQP2 translocated to the apical surface of polarized MDCK cells ( Figure 4B, second column).

The perinuclear distribution of AQP2 - F204V is consistent with an ER compartmentalization.

To test the idea that AQP2 - F204V localizes to the ER, we co - stained cells transfected with Aqp2F204V ( cDNA) for AQP2 and an ER marker, calnexin ( Figure 4C).	"ER	52	54	GO_ontology"	"ER	129	131	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""ER"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""ER"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
The remaining 20% appeared at the periphery of the ER, representing AQP2 - F204V that had potentially progressed beyond the ER.

AQP2 - GFP localized to the apical surface upon forskolin stimulation whether it was transiently transfected into vector - only cells ( Figure 5C, upper left images) or into wild - type AQP2 cells ( Figure 5C, upper right).

When expressed in wild - type AQP2 cells, however, AQP2 - F204V - GFP localized to the apical surface to varying degrees ( Figure 5C, lower right images [ i - iii]).

Although the effect was subtle in cell ( iii), AQP2 - F204V - GFP was partly localized to the apical surface.

Since only cell surface proteins are accessible to biotin, these results indicate that AQP2 - F204V is transported to the cell surface when wild - type AQP2 is present, but not on its own.

Immunostaining of kidney shows that AQP2 - F204V does not efficiently transport water, because it fails to localize to the apical cell surface after dDAVP treatment.

The second conclusion from this study is that loci of possible importance for CIA have been detected, two associated with arthritis susceptibility ( chromosomes 1 and 11) and one associated with anti - CII titers ( chromosome 13).

While we did not address the question whether the SAM domain of mr - s forms a polymeric structure in the present study, the phylogenetic analysis of SAM domain of mr - s and other SAM domain - containing molecules suggests that mr - s can form head - to - tail polymer and mediate gene silencing by spreading repressive complexes along the chromatin similar to ph and / or TEL.

Finally, none of the mutant TFIIH combinations ( carrying alterations associated with TTD [ XPDR722W], XPCS [ XPDG602D], or XP [ XPDR683W]) exhibited synergism in an in vitro NER reaction reconstituted with different mutant TFIIH complexes ( Figure 4D).

However, based on the ability of cell extracts that are defective in two different TFIIH components ( XPD and XPB) to complement NER activity in vitro [ 26], it is likely that TFIIH ( or its components) can either multimerise or exchange at least during the NER reaction.

We thus envisage the molecular mechanism of interallelic complementation to involve the exchange of XPD molecules within the TFIIH complex or turnover of TFIIH complexes containing different XPD molecules at the site of DNA damage during the course of the global genome as well as transcription - coupled repair of either UV - induced or endogenous DNA damage.

To analyze the role of chromatin assembly factor 1 ( CAF - 1) during pre - implantation development, we generated a mouse line carrying a targeted mutation in the gene encoding its large subunit, p150CAF - 1.

Absence of p150CAF - 1 in these embryos results in severe alterations in the nuclear organization of constitutive heterochromatin.

Furthermore, loss of CAF - 1 in these cells results in the alteration of epigenetic histone methylation marks at the level of pericentric heterochromatin.

Here, the authors studied the role of a basic chromatin assembly factor ( CAF - 1) in mouse embryonic stem cells and early embryos.

In addition, this study revealed that CAF - 1 is required for the proper spatial organization of chromosomes in the nucleus.	"CAF - 1	38	45	GO_ontology"	"chromosomes in the nucleus	97	123	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""chromosomes in the nucleus"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Specifically, CAF - 1 deposits the histone H3 variant H3. 1 into chromatin, in a pathway coupled to DNA synthesis, whereas a second histone chaperone, HIRA, is involved in the deposition of the H3. 3 variant in a DNA synthesis independent pathway [ 11, 12].	"CAF - 1	14	21	GO_ontology"	"chromatin	65	74	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""chromatin"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Taken together, these data suggest roles for CAF - 1 in the formation of heterochromatin and in the heritability of epigenetic traits.	"CAF - 1	45	52	GO_ontology"	"heterochromatin	73	88	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""heterochromatin"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
We provide evidence that CAF - 1 is required for the spatial organization and epigenetic marking of heterochromatin domains in pluripotent embryonic cells.

Thus, the nuclear organization of heterochromatin is dramatically modified during pre - implantation development, between the two - cell and blastocyst stages.	"nuclear	10	17	GO_ontology"	"heterochromatin	34	49	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""heterochromatin"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Localization of HP1 alpha showed a diffuse pattern similar to the DAPI, with some enrichment at the nuclear periphery, and around the nucleoli ( Figure 1D).	"nuclear	100	107	GO_ontology"	"nucleoli	134	142	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""nucleoli"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
This abnormal organization of heterochromatin in Chaf1a - / - embryos is reminiscent of the heterochromatin organization found in two - to four - cell stage wild - type embryos ( compare Figure 1D and 1F).	"heterochromatin	30	45	GO_ontology"	"heterochromatin	92	107	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""heterochromatin"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""heterochromatin"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
DAPI - dense foci were lost, and we observed diffuse HP1 alpha and DAPI staining around the nucleoli and at the periphery of the nucleus ( Figure 2B).	"nucleoli	92	100	GO_ontology"	"nucleus	129	136	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""nucleoli"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""nucleus"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
This result indicates that p150CAF - 1 is essential for nuclear organization of heterochromatin in ES cells in a similar way to early pre - implantation embryos.

These data show that nuclear architecture is not globally altered following CAF - 1 loss - of - function.

In addition, Western blot analysis revealed that CAF - 1 depletion did not result in altered levels of chromatin architectural proteins such as histone H3 and HP1 alpha ( Figure S1).	"CAF - 1	49	56	GO_ontology"	"chromatin	103	112	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""chromatin"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
In order to better characterize the defects in heterochromatin organization, we performed two - color DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH) experiments to reveal the spatial distribution of pericentric and centric chromosomal regions, which in mouse are mainly composed of large blocks of major and minor satellite repeats, respectively [ 20].	"heterochromatin	47	62	GO_ontology"	"pericentric and centric chromosomal regions	199	242	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""heterochromatin"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""pericentric and centric chromosomal regions"", ""start_span"": 199, ""end_span"": 242, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Pericentric domains from different chromosomes form clusters, which are revealed by FISH as large spots that coincide with DAPI - dense foci in the interphase nucleus ( Figure 4A).	"Pericentric domains from different chromosomes	0	46	GO_ontology"	"nucleus	159	166	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Pericentric domains from different chromosomes"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""nucleus"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 166, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Quantification of fluorescence along a line randomly drawn across the nucleus revealed lower fluorescence intensity and a broader distribution of DAPI and major satellite hybridization signals in p150CAF - 1 - depleted cells ( Figure 4C and 4D), indicating decondensation of pericentric heterochromatin domains.	"nucleus	70	77	GO_ontology"	"pericentric heterochromatin domains	275	310	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""nucleus"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""pericentric heterochromatin domains"", ""start_span"": 275, ""end_span"": 310, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Using DNase I and micrococcal nuclease ( MNase) assays, we could not observe any significant difference between control and p150CAF - 1 - depleted ES cells at the level of bulk genome chromatin or at pericentric repeats ( Figure 5).	"chromatin	184	193	GO_ontology"	"pericentric	200	211	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""chromatin"", ""start_span"": 184, ""end_span"": 193, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""pericentric"", ""start_span"": 200, ""end_span"": 211, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Therefore, the loss of clustering and decondensation of pericentric heterochromatin are unlikely to be the consequence of severe defects in nucleosomal organization.	"pericentric heterochromatin	56	83	GO_ontology"	"nucleosomal	140	151	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""pericentric heterochromatin"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""nucleosomal"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
We next analyzed specific histone modifications [ 27] in chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP) experiments using native chromatin [ 28].	"chromatin	57	66	GO_ontology"	"chromatin	120	129	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""chromatin"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""chromatin"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
We found that pericentric DNA was immunoprecipitated with a 2 - fold lower efficiency with H4K20me3 [ 29, 30] antibodies following p150CAF - 1 depletion ( Figure 7A and 7B).	"pericentric DNA	14	29	GO_ontology"	"antibodies	110	120	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""pericentric DNA"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""antibodies"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Altogether, our results show that depletion of CAF - 1 in ES cells leads to a simultaneous disruption of heterochromatin 3 - D organization and an alteration in epigenetic marking.	"CAF - 1	47	54	GO_ontology"	"heterochromatin	105	120	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""heterochromatin"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
We show that in p150CAF - 1 - depleted ES cells, while DNA replication initially persists without significant perturbation in nucleosomal organization, severe heterochromatin organization defects can be observed.	"nucleosomal	126	137	GO_ontology"	"heterochromatin	159	174	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""nucleosomal"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""heterochromatin"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Alternatively, early embryos and ES cells, whose genome is more plastic than somatic cells, might represent a particularly sensitive context in which the importance of CAF - 1 in heterochromatin organization is exacerbated.	"CAF - 1	168	175	GO_ontology"	"heterochromatin	179	194	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 168, ""end_span"": 175, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""heterochromatin"", ""start_span"": 179, ""end_span"": 194, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
In ES cells, major architectural chromatin proteins are hyperdynamic and bind relatively loosely to chromatin [ 35].	"chromatin	33	42	GO_ontology"	"chromatin	100	109	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""chromatin"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""chromatin"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
This phenotype is somehow reminiscent of loss of CAF - 1 - mediated defects in heterochromatin organization in early mouse embryos.	"CAF - 1	49	56	GO_ontology"	"heterochromatin	79	94	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""heterochromatin"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
In mouse ES cells, we show that CAF - 1 is also required for regular levels of H4K20me3 at pericentric repeats, but not at IAP elements, which are repeated sequences spread all over the mouse genome.	"CAF - 1	32	39	GO_ontology"	"pericentric	91	102	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""pericentric"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
These data suggest that proper nuclear organization and epigenetic marking of pericentric heterochromatin are coupled in ES cells.

Alternatively, 3 - D organization of heterochromatin and epigenetic marking might represent two independent functions of CAF - 1.	"heterochromatin	37	52	GO_ontology"	"CAF - 1	121	128	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""heterochromatin"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
In agreement with a recent report [ 40], our analysis of heterochromatin in pre - implantation embryos has revealed drastic changes in nuclear organization between the two - cell and blastocyst stages.	"heterochromatin	57	72	GO_ontology"	"nuclear	135	142	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""heterochromatin"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Hence, remodeling of heterochromatin 3 - D organization parallels nuclear reprogramming toward an early embryonic status in cloned embryos.

These data show that CAF - 1 is involved in setting up proper heterochromatin architecture during the first cell divisions of embryonic life.

Given the importance of nuclear organization in the control of gene expression [ 21, 41], this finding suggests that CAF - 1 contributes to the coordinated programs of gene expression during early embryogenesis.

To test the association of histone H3 with chromatin in control and p150 - depleted cells, isolated nuclei were incubated on ice for 30 min in buffer 2 ( 50 mM Hepes [ pH7. 9], 20% Glycerol, 3 mM MgCl2, 0. 1% IGEPAL, 0. 5 mM DTT, 0. 5 mM PMSF) supplemented with either 0. 1 M, 0. 3 M, 0. 45 M, 0. 7 M, or 1 M NaCl.

Chat was seen in fewer cells in the mature Rb KO retina, and was present in the soma but absent from processes ( Figure 3B).

Importantly, Camk2a + tracks and dendrites were present in both the WT and Rb KO retina ( Figure 3B), and the number of Camk2a + soma was similar in WT and Rb KO retina at P30 and beyond, although fewer cells stained in Rb KO retina at P18, suggesting a delay in its appearance ( Figures 3C and S6B).

The presence of Chat in some cell bodies but never in processes ( Figure 3B) also suggests a transport defect.

As noted above, Slc18a3 was absent at P18 in the Rb KO retina ( Figure 3A); at P4 or P5 it was in cell bodies, yet was rarely present in Rb KO processes ( Figures 4A and S6).

Indeed, double labelling with E2f3 ( red) and Chat plus Slc18a3 ( green) confirmed that E2f3 is present in both SAC soma and dendrites ( Figure 5B).

Two closely migrating E2f3a bands were detected, more clearly evident at P18, of which the faster migrating species was dominant in nuclear and the slower species was dominant in cytoplasm ( Figure 6).

A very faint cytoplasmic Rb signal was evident at P18, which is consistent with Rb staining of SAC processes ( Figure 5B), and with the very small proportion of SACs in the retina [ 38].

The E2f dimerization partner, Tfdp1, which lacks a nuclear localization signal [ 54], was primarily cytoplasmic at both P0 and P18, and the Cdk inhibitors Cdkn1a and Cdkn1b showed a similar pattern of distribution ( Figure 6).
