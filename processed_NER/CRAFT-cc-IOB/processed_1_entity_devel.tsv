Named after its effects on craniofacial morphology, droopy ear is a recessive mutation on mouse Chromosome 3; the original allele described more than 40 years ago by Curry ( 1959) is extinct, but a spontaneous remutation that occurred in Harwell, deH, is available through The Jackson Laboratory ( Bar Harbor, Maine, United States).

Similarly, TACC1 pseudogenes also exist spread over 22 kb of the centromeric region of human chromosome 10 and, in 8q21, a shorter region 86% identical to the final 359 bp of the TACC1 3 ' untranslated region.

Evidence used in support of this claim included its chromosomal location on 5q32 in humans ( discussed below), its sequence similarity in its coiled coil domain to the TACC domain and the subcellular localization of the RHAMM protein in the centrosome.

Paralogous genes present in at least two of the four loci are shown, with the exception of the region between GPX3 and NKX2E on chromosome 5, which appears to represent a series of intervening genes inserted after duplication of the 4p16 / 5q32 - 35 clusters, and genes mentioned in Fig.	"chromosome	128	138	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""chromosome"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"

In deuterostomes, this exon contains the SDP repeat ( or in the case of the murine TACC3 ' s, a rodent - specific 24 amino acid repeat), which is responsible for the binding of the SWI / SNF chromatin remodeling complex component GAS41 [ 15, 16].

The functions of these different isoforms are unknown, however the region deleted from the shorter variants can include the binding site for LSm7 [ 20] ( variants C, D, F - I), and / or the nuclear localization signals and binding site for GAS41 [ 15] and PCTAIRE2BP [ 20] ( isoforms B - D, S).

Similarly, large scale proteomics [ 29] has shown that Drosophila TACC interacts with two proteins, the RNA binding protein TBPH and CG14540 ( Fig. 6B), and thus indirectly with the Drosophila SWI / SNF chromatin remodeling complex and DNA damage repair machinery.	"SWI / SNF chromatin remodeling complex	193	231	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""SWI / SNF chromatin remodeling complex"", ""start_span"": 193, ""end_span"": 231, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"

Many of these proteins do not appear to interact directly with the protostome TACCs, but would be expected to be in the same protein complex ( Fig. 6C, 6D).	"protein complex	125	140	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""protein complex"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Significantly, RXR beta is a close family relative of the nuclear hormone receptor, nhr - 86, from C. elegans, which interacts with the ceTAC binding protein lin36 ( Fig. 6A).	"nuclear	58	65	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
It is also intriguing that the deuterostome specific SDP repeat interacts with GAS41, a component / accessory factor of the human SWI / SNF chromatin remodeling complex [ 3, 15].

This further suggests that the vertebrate TACCs have gained the specific ability to direct interact with transcriptional regulatory complexes, and that bridging protein ( s) are no longer required.

This may also explain the absence of lin15A, lin36 and lin37 homologues in higher organisms, as they were no longer under selective evolutionary pressure to remain within the complex, and thus lost in the evolving genome.

Thus, alternative splicing of the TACC1 gene adds further diversity to TACC1 function, as the deletion of specific exons and their associated binding domains will change the potential protein complexes with which they can associate, either directly, or by redirecting the splice variants to different subcellular compartments.

In order to assess whether these supernumerary S - opsin - expressing cells coexpressed rod - specific markers, a double antibody staining for S - opsin and rhodopsin was performed.

This study showed mutually exclusive domains of expression of S - opsin and rhodopsin in the photoreceptor outer segments ( Figure 3D - 3F).

A number of these novel cone - specific genes showed a striking localization of their transcripts to the photoreceptor inner segment ( e. g., Bub1b and Tcta).	"photoreceptor inner segment	105	132	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptor inner segment"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
This localization manifests in a section in situ hybridization as a dark band of staining just beyond the outer edge of the ONL immediately underlying the outer segment layer.	"outer segment	155	168	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""outer segment"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 168, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
However, due to the weakness of the signal in some cases, or transcript localization to the inner segment in others, it was not always possible to determine with confidence which of the two patterns of derepression ( if either) each of these genes displayed.	"inner segment	92	105	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""inner segment"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
One further finding to note is that the cell bodies of the M - opsin - positive cells appear to be scattered throughout the ONL in the rd7 mutant at P14 ( Figure S8).	"cell bodies	40	51	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""cell bodies"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
In addition, by P28, the M - opsin - positive cell bodies in rd7 appear to have relocated to their normal position at the scleral edge of the ONL ( Figure S8).	"cell bodies	46	57	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""cell bodies"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
It is known that until P11, the cell bodies of cone photoreceptors in the mouse are normally dispersed throughout the ONL, only to relocate subsequently to the scleral edge of the ONL around P12 [ 23].	"cell bodies	32	43	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""cell bodies"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
It is possible that in the rd7 mutant retina, there is a short delay in the relocation of the M - opsin - expressing cone cell bodies to the scleral edge of the ONL.

Analysis of toluidine blue - stained semi - thin sections revealed that such cone - like cells were present in greater abundance in the rd7 retina than in wild - type, and that their somata were scattered throughout the ONL ( Figure 7).

"These findings, along with the absence of rhodopsin staining in these cells ( see Figure 3D - 3F), suggest that these "" cone - like "" cells in the rd7 mutant retina may represent supernumerary normal cones with an abnormal localization of their cell bodies."

It is also notable that the standard deviation of the somal area is nearly twice as great in rd7 than in wild - type, confirming the subjective impression of greater variability in somal size and shape in the mutant compared to the wild - type ( compare Figure 7C and 7D).

This interpretation is consistent with previous studies which have revealed that the carboxy terminus of an analogous subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is essential for subunit interactions [ 35] and insertion of a Hisx6 tag on the carboxy terminus of an analogous E. coli subunit interfered with normal subunit assembly [ 36].

The observation that rDNA is hypomethylated in the absence of Atrx, even in ES cells, is consistent with the finding that hypomethylation of the human rDNA repeats is detectable from an early developmental stage in ATR - X patients.

To investigate the morphology of Atrxnull embryos prior to death, embryos from the above crosses were initially dissected in their deciduas at 7. 5 dpc, and paraffin sections were stained with haematoxylin ( Figure 5A) or with an anti - ATRX antibody ( Figure 5B - 5E).

Only background staining was seen in the corresponding Atrxnull embryonic tissues ( Figure 5B - 5D), while expression in the surrounding decidual tissue ( of maternal origin) was normal and served as an antibody staining control ( unpublished data).

Although a growth defect was also observed in Atrxnull ES cells ( Figure 3A), in contrast to the Atrxnull embryos, the mitotic index of the ES cell population ( as measured with the same antibody) was not depleted ( Figure S1B).

We found that the population of Pl - 1 - expressing cells was depleted in the decidual implantation sites containing Atrxnull embryos relative to those containing wild - type littermates ( Figure 7B); this was also apparent at 7. 5 dpc, as determined by immunohistochemical staining of paraffin sections of embryos in deciduas with an anti - Pl - 1 antibody ( Figure 7C).

In contrast, the epiblast region of carrier female embryos was composed of a mosaic of small clusters of Atrx - positive cells ( in which the Atrxnull allele on Xm had been inactivated) and Atrx - negative cells ( in which the AtrxWT allele on Xp had been inactivated), indicating that the Atrx gene was subject to normal random X - inactivation in the epiblast.

The human ATRX protein has been shown to associate in a complex with Daxx [ 8], a protein that has been implicated in multiple pathways for the regulation of apoptosis [ 21].	"complex	56	63	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""complex"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
It is possible that disruption of the mouse Atrx - Daxx complex ( by ablation of the Atrx protein) could have triggered a universal proapoptotic response.	"complex	56	63	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""complex"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
In contrast, all disease - causing mutations characterised in human ATR - X pedigrees appear to give rise to hypomorphic alleles.	"X	74	75	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""X"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Further evidence that Atrx is also required at later stages of mouse development is provided by the observed dramatic skewing against Atrx - negative cells in some somatic tissues of carrier female mice, whose tissues initially comprise a mosaic of Atrx - positive and Atrx - negative cells as a result of random X - inactivation ( M. Muers, personal communication).	"X	313	314	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""X"", ""start_span"": 313, ""end_span"": 314, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Given the similarity of the Atrx - and Hand1 - mutant phenotypes and the likelihood that Atrx acts as a transcriptional regulator by modifying chromatin structure, it will be of interest to determine whether Atrx is itself a regulator of Hand1 expression, or alternatively whether it acts as a co - regulator of one or more of the downstream transcriptional targets of Hand1.

Silencing of the AtrxWT allele on Xp should render these females null for Atrx in the extraembryonic tissues, since the normally active Xm chromosome carries the Atrx Delta 18 Delta neo allele.

The survival of Atrx carrier females contrasts with the phenotypes seen in carriers of mutations of other murine X - linked genes known to be essential in the extraembryonic compartment.	"X	113	114	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""X"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Thus, unlike Atrx, these genes and / or their effects on cell growth are unable to circumvent the processes that ultimately cause all cells in the extraembryonic tissues to express only the maternally derived X chromosome.

However, it was recently demonstrated that the paternal Atrx ( called Xnp) allele is completely silenced in a normal mouse trophoblast stem cell line [ 32], suggesting that Atrx does not normally escape imprinted X - inactivation in the extraembryonic tissues of wild - type females.	"X	70	71	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""X"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
On average, 50% of the cells in this randomly inactivating subpopulation would be expected to maintain an active Xp chromosome.	"chromosome	116	126	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""chromosome"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
In support of this hypothesis, it has been demonstrated that expression of paternally transmitted X - linked lacZ [ 33, 34] and GFP [ 35] transgenes failed to be silenced in a small subpopulation of extraembryonic cells.	"X	98	99	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""X"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Although initially small and quickly diluted in normal embryos, the cellular subpopulation that inactivates the Xm chromosome could rapidly expand to replace the normally imprinted cells in extraembryonic lineages if the normal silencing of Xp compromises cell growth or differentiation.	"chromosome	115	125	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""chromosome"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Another possible mechanism is that inactivation of the paternal X proceeds normally in all cells, but subsequently the Atrx gene within individual cells is reactivated.	"X	64	65	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""X"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Nevertheless, we have previously noted that none of the natural mutations causing ATR - X syndrome are nulls, which suggests that it plays a critical role in normal development.	"X	88	89	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""X"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"

In the normal skin, beta - catenin, a member of the adherens junction complex, was found in the ORS of hair follicles and basal layer of epidermis, where K14 expression is also observed ( Figure 4C and 4D), whereas the expression of K1, involucrin, and loricrin ( markers for spinous and granular layers of epidermis) was only observed in the nonbasal epidermis ( unpublished data).

However, there were small populations of lightly stained cells by H & E extending from the edge of the outer cortex towards inner medulla ( Figure 6E), and these cells showed intense nuclear beta - catenin staining whereas the rest of the medullary cells showed diffuse beta - catenin staining pattern similar to that of the control ( Figure 6F).

It is unclear when K14 - cre induction actually takes place in the mutant thymus, but as the population of cells showing a strong nuclear beta - catenin staining as well as the cells expressing K14 were small and thymic epithelial compartments still existed in a mild P3 mutant thymus ( Figure 6E and 6F), it seems that initial differentiation to medullary and cortical TECs and thymocyte colonization have already taken place prior to the major effects of K14 - driven Apc loss.

With age, beta - catenin expression pattern became more diffuse and fewer epithelial cells showed nuclear localization but K8 + K14 + cells remained, forming concentric structures of epithelial cells filled with hard keratin deposits and infiltrated with vast number of neutrophils and macrophages.
