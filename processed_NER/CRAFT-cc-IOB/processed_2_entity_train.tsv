Its presence in vesicles led to the suggestion, that, along with raft domains, annexin A7 plays a role in membrane organization and the vesiculation process.

The typical biconcave form depends on various influences including the membrane lipid composition and the submembranous cytoskeleton [ 32] where annexin A7 might play a role.

Furthermore, the distribution of both annexin A7 isoforms in gradients of red blood cells indicates a function which differs from organizing subcellular membranes or membrane pathways.

Previous results in which annexin A7 was shown to play a role in membrane aggregation might be explained by a supportive function of annexin A7 in that it interferes with the local Ca2 + homeostasis thus influencing membrane organization.

Nevertheless it might interact with other components and have a role in organizing the membrane cytoskeleton, controlling raft protein associations or influencing the ionic strength of red blood cells on its own or by interfering with other signaling pathways.

We were intrigued both by previous reports of splicing of human olfactory receptors near the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC) cluster, where several genes splice over long distances to a common upstream exon [ 26, 27] and by the idea that olfactory receptor transcriptional control could be achieved by DNA recombination mechanisms, perhaps with the result that transcripts would contain some sequence from another locus.

The abnormal transport and processing of cathepsin D suggested membrane trafficking disruptions in homozygous CbCln3 Delta ex7 / 8 cells; therefore, we surveyed the subcellular distribution and morphology of membrane organelles.

Lysotracker stain was dramatically reduced in homozygous mutant cells ( CbCln3 Delta ex7 / 8 / Delta ex7 / 8), with smaller labeled vesicles and less apparent perinuclear clustering.

Following a 15 - minute incubation in media containing dextran - FITC, wild - type and heterozygote cells displayed brightly stained, large endocytic vesicles that were clustered in the perinuclear region.

However, homozygous CbCln3 Delta ex7 / 8 cells were less brightly stained with most dextran - FITC signal localizing to smaller vesicles scattered throughout the cytoplasm of the cell.

Mitochondrial distribution in homozygous CbCln3 Delta ex7 / 8 cells was indistinguishable from wild - type and heterozygous cells; however, homozygous CbCln3 Delta ex7 / 8 mitochondria appeared more elongated by grp75 marker immunostaining and TEM analysis ( Fig. 8a).

72% of homozygous mutant mitochondria were greater than 0. 6 mu m in length ( range = 0. 26 mu m to 2. 75 mu m), while fewer wild - type mitochondria ( 51%) reached this length ( range = 0. 15 mu m to 2. 29 mu m).

Moreover, this is the first study to indicate recessive endosomal / lysosomal membrane trafficking defects and mitochondrial dysfunction that precedes subunit c deposition in an accurate JNCL model.

Abnormal cathepsin D localization and processing in homozygous CbCln3 Delta ex7 / 8 cells and Cln3 Delta ex7 / 8 mice likely reflects altered vesicular trafficking and / or lysosomal pH, which is known to impact cathepsin D processing [ 14, 16].

Indeed, CLN3 overexpression in HEK - 293 cells altered lysosomal pH and cathepsin D processing [ 17], and lysosomal pH homeostasis is disrupted in JNCL [ 10, 15].

These observations argue that membrane trafficking defects do not result from excessive subunit c accumulation compromising the lysosome, but rather are early events in the disease process preceding subunit c accumulation.

Mitochondrial abnormalities, which have also been reported in JNCL patients and other animal models [ 21 - 23], may result from ineffective turnover by autophagy, a lysosomal - targeted pathway [ 24].

Occasionally, these nuclei appeared pyknotic ( Figure 3A, n); but, more frequently exhibited the heterochromatin pattern typical of photoreceptors ( data not shown), strongly suggesting that they belonged to ectopic photoreceptors.

The third pathological entity noted in the outer segment layer were numerous small vesicles ( Figure 3A arrow) 100 to 200 nm in diameter.

They appeared to be emerging from the inner segments, as scanning electron microscopic images showed spherical structures budding from the inner segments ( Figure 3C, arrow).

In the Crx - / - retina, only an occassional connecting cilium was noted emerging from inner segments at this stage ( Figure 4A and 4B).	"connecting cilium	45	62	GO_ontology"	"inner segments	87	101	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""connecting cilium"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""inner segments"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
At P14, elongating outer segments were noted on Crx + / + photoreceptors, occasionally demonstrating a paddle - like structure at their apex ( Figure 4C, os).

In Crx - / - retinae, the vast majority of photoreceptors at this stage demonstrated connecting cilia without outer segments ( Figure 4D, cc).

Sporadically, Crx - / - photoreceptors would exhibit an irregular structure extending from a connecting cilium ( Figure 4D, cc *) perhaps representing a malformed outer segment.

These data demonstrate a complete absence of normal outer segment formation in the Crx mutant mouse, and the arrest of development of the photoreceptor appendage at the elongation stage of outer segment formation.

Further, as shown here, the vesicles appear to bud from the inner segments themselves.

In developing photoreceptors, an extraordinary growth process occurs whereby the outer segment is generated from the nascent connecting cilium ( see [ 38] and references therein).

In situ hybridization using probes from this collection of genes has revealed that some of them have their RNA localized to the inner segment, a finding typical for proteins targeted to the outer segment.

These data then suggest that the fact that the Crx - / - photoreceptors do not have proper synaptic endings is not due to a lack of outer segment formation.

Using immunohistochemistry, we examined the expression of common pre - synaptic terminal proteins, including KIF3a, SV2, and synaptophysin, and were unable to observe qualitative differences between Crx - / - and control tissue at P14 ( data not shown).

It is not known whether any of these genes are involved in building or regulating synaptic structures, but they are now genes that might lead to a better understanding of the construction and function of the relatively unique structure of the ribbon synapse.

First, laminin beta2 chain - deficient mice displayed abnormal outer segment elongation, but a more mild phenotype than that of the Crx - / - mice; the outer segments were reduced by 50% in length.

The outer plexiform layer of the beta2 - deficient retinas demonstrated only 7% normal invaginating synapses, while the remainder had various pathologies, including floating synaptic ribbons, as seen here.

Postnatal mitochondrial biogenesis involves multiple signaling and transcriptional regulatory pathways that control the coordinate expression of nuclear and mitochondrial genes involved in mitochondrial structure, metabolism, and proliferation [ 1].

Several lines of evidence, based on the results of overexpression studies, indicate that PGC - 1 alpha is sufficient to promote mitochondrial biogenesis and regulate mitochondrial respiratory capacity.

Second, forced expression studies in adipogenic and myogenic mammalian cell lines demonstrated that PGC - 1 alpha activates mitochondrial biogenesis through a group of transcription factor targets including nuclear respiratory factors 1 and 2 ( NRF - 1 and - 2) and mitochondrial transcription factor A ( Tfam), key transcriptional regulators of mitochondrial DNA transcription and replication [ 8].

Given the important role of PGC - 1 alpha in mitochondrial function and biogenesis, we examined mitochondrial ultrastructure in the relevant tissues.

Quantitative morphometry of the electron micrographs confirmed that the cellular volume density of soleus mitochondria was significantly lower in PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice compared to PGC - 1 alpha + / + controls independent of changes in the myofibrillar component ( Figure 3B).

Consistent with a defect in mitochondrial biogenesis, we found a reduction in the expression of nuclear genes encoding proteins involved in mitochondrial electron transport ( cytochrome c and cytochrome oxidase IV) and oxidative phosphorylation ( beta subunit of ATP synthase) in soleus muscle of PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice compared with PGC - 1 alpha + / + controls.

In addition, the expression of Tfam, a known PGC - 1 alpha target involved in mitochondrial DNA replication / transcription, was diminished in PGC - 1 alpha - / - soleus, providing one potential mechanism for defective mitochondrial biogenesis ( Figure 3C).

Forced expression of PGC - 1 alpha triggers mitochondrial biogenesis by activating a complex circuitry of factors including NRF - 1, NRF - 2, and the orphan nuclear receptor estrogen - related receptor alpha [ 23, 32].

For example the nucleocytoplasmic compartmentalization of Annexin A2 is controlled by sequestration of the AnxA2 / p11 complex modulated by phosphorylation and by a nuclear export signal found in the AnxA2 3 - 12 region [ 33].

Neuronal differentiation is a protracted process during which newly generated neurons express distinct cellular and molecular programs at precise times during their maturation: long - distance axon outgrowth, subsequent terminal branching, and finally synaptogenesis.

In summary, whereas isochronic expression of EWS - Pea3 promoted the establishment of proprioceptive afferent projections into the ventral spinal cord, precocious expression of the same ETS signaling factor in DRG neurons interfered with establishment of projections into the spinal cord as well as to peripheral targets.

In such tubules, nuclei of pre - meiotic germ cells and spermatocytes were packed close to the basal membrane and few germ cells were found in the adlumenal region.

Most Sertoli cell nuclei were adjacent to the basal membrane in wild - type, but mutant Sertoli cells were displaced in some tubules ( arrowhead).

Sertoli cell nuclei are positioned normally near the basal membrane in SC - Dmrt7KO mice.

In addition, GATA1 staining showed that Sertoli cell nuclei were located adjacent to the basement membrane as in wild - type ( Figure 6E).

We first asked whether DMRT7 is required for XY body formation by evaluating several characteristic XY body chromatin features.	"XY body	45	52	GO_ontology"	"XY body chromatin	100	117	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""XY body"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""XY body chromatin"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
SUMO - 1 expression normally increases in the XY body of early - to mid - pachytene spermatocytes at the time of sex chromosome condensation.

Prior to the completion of the first meiotic division, SUMO - 1 disappears from the XY body as the X and Y chromosomes desynapse [ 40].

Analysis of nuclear spreads revealed that Ub - H2A localizes normally to the XY body in Dmrt7 mutants ( Figure S4).	"nuclear	12	19	GO_ontology"	"XY body	77	84	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""XY body"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Collectively, these results indicate that Dmrt7 mutant germ cells can establish an XY body with at least some of the normal chromatin marks.	"XY body	83	90	GO_ontology"	"chromatin	124	133	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""XY body"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""chromatin"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Recently, MSCI has been shown to continue into meiosis II and spermiogenesis, apparently mediated by a distinct chromatin compartment termed postmeiotic sex chromatin ( PMSC) that is established starting in diplonema [ 16].	"chromatin compartment	112	133	GO_ontology"	"sex chromatin	153	166	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""chromatin compartment"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""sex chromatin"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 166, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
To examine XY transcriptional status, we carried out Cot - 1 RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH) to detect nascent RNA polymerase II transcription, combined with DAPI staining to locate the XY body on spreads of seminiferous tubules ( Figure 8A and 8B).	"RNA polymerase II	126	143	GO_ontology"	"XY body	201	208	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""RNA polymerase II"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""XY body"", ""start_span"": 201, ""end_span"": 208, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
We also examined heterochromatin protein 1 beta ( HP1 beta), which normally localizes to the X centromere at mid - pachynema and then spreads through the XY body as it internalizes during diplonema [ 56].	"X	93	94	GO_ontology"	"XY body	154	161	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""X"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""XY body"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Cot - 1 RNA FISH ( red) reveals normal silencing of sex chromosome transcription in XY body.	"sex chromosome	52	66	GO_ontology"	"XY body	84	91	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""sex chromosome"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""XY body"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Some of the mutant diplotene cells showing abnormal sex chromatin also had abnormal autosomal gamma H2AX staining ( Figure 8L).	"sex chromatin	52	65	GO_ontology"	"autosomal	84	93	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""sex chromatin"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""autosomal"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Because this process could be abnormal in the mutant cells, we also staged mutant cells by chromosome morphology using an antibody to SYCP3 ( Figure 9).	"chromosome	91	101	GO_ontology"	"antibody	122	130	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""chromosome"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""antibody"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
From these results, we conclude that Dmrt7 mutant cells establish a normal XY body in mid - pachynema, but then have multiple epigenetic defects in the sex chromatin transition from pachynema to diplonema.

( A) Spread of wild - type germ cell stained with DAPI, anti - SYCP3, and anti - HP1 beta showing chromosome morphology typical of diplonema and internalized XY body with HP1 beta accumulation.

Examination of chromatin and nascent transcription in mutant cells that progressed to diplonema revealed sex chromatin abnormalities, as discussed below.

Another key event of pachynema in male mammals is the packaging of the sex chromosomes into the XY body and the establishment of MSCI.	"sex chromosomes	71	86	GO_ontology"	"XY body	96	103	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""sex chromosomes"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""XY body"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Surprisingly, we found that these cells form an XY body with normal morphology and proper accumulation of all the chromatin marks we examined.	"XY body	48	55	GO_ontology"	"chromatin	114	123	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""XY body"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""chromatin"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Because most Dmrt7 mutant germ cells are eliminated by apoptosis around the time at which we observed sex chromatin defects, a simple model is that the apoptosis is a consequence of the sex chromatin defects.	"sex chromatin	102	115	GO_ontology"	"sex chromatin	186	199	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""sex chromatin"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""sex chromatin"", ""start_span"": 186, ""end_span"": 199, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
The reciprocal situation ( sex chromatin defects caused by apoptosis) is possible, but seems unlikely, because we observed mutant cells with sex chromatin defects but no indications of apoptosis.	"sex chromatin	27	40	GO_ontology"	"sex chromatin	141	154	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""sex chromatin"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""sex chromatin"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
An attractive speculation is that DMRT7 may provide sequence specificity in recruiting other proteins, such as chromatin modifiers, to the XY body as part of the transition to PMSC.	"chromatin	111	120	GO_ontology"	"XY body	139	146	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""chromatin"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""XY body"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Monotremes have five X and five Y chromosomes, which form an extended pairing chain during meiosis and appear unrelated to the sex chromosomes of the other mammals [ 61].

The presence of Dmrt7 in both lineages may support a common origin for either the sex chromosomes or the sex chromatin of monotremes and other mammals.	"sex chromosomes	82	97	GO_ontology"	"sex chromatin	105	118	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""sex chromosomes"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""sex chromatin"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
A plausible model is that Dmrt7 evolved during the establishment of mammalian sex determination to help cope with ancestral differences in gene dosage, chromosome pairing, recombination, or other meiotic issues arising from sex chromosome heteromorphy.

PCH2 orthologs are present in organisms that undergo synaptic meiosis, but not asynaptic meiosis, prompting the suggestion that a Pch2 - dependent checkpoint evolved to monitor synaptonemal complex ( SC) defects from yeast to humans [ 12].

Since mutant chromosomes are fully synapsed, and MSUC is known to occur only as a result of asynapsis, the decoration of Trip13Gt / Gt chromosomes with DNA repair markers is probably attributable to incomplete DNA repair rather than transcriptional silencing.

Consistent with the presence of rare ( < 1%) Trip13Gt / Gt pachytene spermatocytes devoid of persistent DNA repair markers, and testis histology showing some degree of postmeiotic progression ( Figure 3G), we observed both diplotene nuclei that lacked autosomal RAD51 / DMC1 and gamma H2AX ( Figure S3A - S3D), and also metaphase I spreads with 20 bivalents ( Figure S3E - S3F).

Remarkably, MLH1 / 3 foci were formed; we observed 1 - 2 foci / chromosome as in wild type and at typical overall levels ( MLH3 = 23 +/- 2, N = 10; [ 30, 32]) on mid - late pachytene chromosomes ( Figure 4M and 4N; MLH1 not shown).

To assess whether these MLH1 / 3 foci in Trip13Gt / Gt pachytene spermatocytes represent CO events completed to a point where they could maintain interhomolog attachments though the end of prophase I, we treated testicular cells from 17. 5 - 20. 5 - d - old control ( + / +), Trip13Gt / Gt, and Dmc1 - / - mice with the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid ( OA), a chemical that induces degradation of the SC, chromosome condensation, and premature progression to metaphase I [ 33].

In mice, Spo11 - / - spermatocytes are severely defective in homologous chromosome synapsis [ 34, 35], and arrest with chromosomes in a state characteristic of the zygotene / pachytene transition ( Figure 3H).

Immunocytological analysis of spread chromosomes showed a failure of homologous chromosome synapsis in both the Rec8 - / - and Rec8 - / - Trip13Gt / Gt spermatocytes, as previously reported for Rec8 mutants ( Figure 5D and 5E) [ 39, 40].

As in Dmc1 - / - mice, in which spermatocytes undergo meiotic arrest from defective DSB repair and failed chromosome synapsis [ 16], spermatogenesis in Dmc1 - / - Trip13Gt / Gt testes was uniformly arrested at the point where spermatocytes contained chromatin characteristic of zygonema / pachynema ( Figure 3N).

Another possibility is that TRIP13 is required for disassembly of NCO recombinational repair complexes [ 51] containing those proteins that persist abnormally on Trip13Gt / Gt pachytene chromosomes.
