In order to examine more precisely the interaction and helicase actions with forked substrates, Y - fork substrates containing a nascent leading strand ( A - fork [ 3 ']), nascent lagging strand ( A - fork [ 5 ']), or both of them ( A - fork [ 3 ', 5 ']), as well as 5 ' - extension or 3 ' - extension structures were constructed.

All members of the ZIP family characterized so far increase intracellular cytoplasmic metal ion concentrations by promoting extracellular and vesicular ion transport into the cytoplasm.

Analysis of Pou4f2, a nuclear transcription factor expressed in ganglion cells, showed that nuclear proteins had not contaminated the cytoplasmic fraction, and analysis of Slc18a3, a cytoplasmic SAC marker, confirmed that the reverse had also not occurred ( Figure 6).
