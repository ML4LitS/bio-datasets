The transcript map of the region surrounding Mcoln1 is similar to the corresponding region of the homologous human MCOLN1 region [ 15], and the presence of the zinc finger gene and Nte confirms and extends the region of synteny between human chromosome 19 and mouse chromosome 8.

TMPred analysis predicts a protein structure that is nearly identical to MCOLN1, containing 6 transmembrane domains with the N - and C - termini residing in the cytoplasm ( Fig. 2) [ 9].

The putative di - leucine ( L - L - X - X) motif at the C - terminus, which may act as a late endosomal / lysosomal targeting signal, is also conserved [ 9].

Since the loss of cholesterol content in the plasma membrane ( and perhaps any membrane) is likely to alter the function of receptors more sensitive to this, loss of normal cholesterol synthesis may cause a loss of signal transduction of a host of such pathways.

The data so far suggest that the ancestral TACC protein played a role in centrosomal / mitotic spindle dynamics.

However, during evolution, the TACC proteins have now acquired the ability to directly interact with components of these complexes ( such as the LSm proteins, nuclear hormone receptors, GAS41, and transcription factors).

This has provided further support that an ancient chromosomal segment was duplicated twice during vertebrate evolution, with the first duplication that gave rise to the human chromosome 4p16 / 5q32 - ter and human chromosome 8p / 10q23 - ter ancestors occurring in the early stages after the invertebrate divergence.

Using an in silico protein - protein interaction model based upon known mitotic spindle and centrosomal components, we have previously predicted a number of additional interactions that could be conserved between a functional TACC homologue in yeast, spc - 72, and one or more human TACC proteins [ 21].	"spindle	80	87	GO_ontology"	"centrosomal	92	103	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""spindle"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""centrosomal"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Thus, it is known that all the TACC proteins examined to date interact, via the TACC domain, with the microtubule / centrosomal proteins of the stu2 / msps / ch - TOG family [ 5, 6, 22 - 24], and with the Aurora kinases [ 20, 21, 25].

Hence, this functional interaction with the centrosome and mitotic spindle is likely to represent the ancient, conserved function of the TACC family.

( B): Using the BIND database [ 29], DTACC directly binds to TBPH and CG14540, and thus indirectly to chromatin remodeling complexes ( SWI / SNF and histone acetyltransferases), DNA damage repair machinery ( via RAD23), and RNA splicing, transport and translational machinery.

The results of our functional analysis, as well as other published data clearly indicate that the vertebrate TACCs interact with proteins that can be divided into two broad categories: 1) proteins with roles in centrosome / mitotic spindle dynamics, and 2) proteins involved in gene regulation, either at the level of transcription, or subsequent RNA processing and translation [ 3, 5 - 7, 15, 19 - 21, 24, 25, 33, 34].

A recent study has suggested that this function may be unique to maskin: although it is unclear whether the other vertebrate TACC3 proteins interact with the eIF4E / CPEB complex, the human TACC1A isoform is unable to interact with the eIF4E / CPEB complex.

In the placenta, female mice normally inactivate the X chromosome that they inherit from their fathers ( Xp), so if females inherit from their mother an X chromosome ( Xm) that bears the abnormal copy of Atrx ( XmMUTXp), one would predict that, like affected males, they would fail to form a normal placenta.

The former motif is thought to be involved in protein - protein interactions in chromatin [ 7], and the latter is a feature of chromatin - remodelling proteins, and the presence of disease - causing mutations indicates the functional importance of these domains.

The consistent core of clinical and haematological features observed in ATR - X patients suggests that, like the SWI2 / SNF2 chromatin - remodelling protein, ATRX probably regulates transcription of a discrete set of target genes.

In the mouse, X chromosome inactivation is subject to parental imprinting in the trophectoderm and primitive endoderm lineages that give rise to the extraembryonic tissues, resulting in inactivation of the paternal X chromosome ( Xp) [ 18].

Thus, in the extraembryonic compartment of AtrxWT / null carrier females, normal imprinted X - inactivation would be expected to result in silencing of the paternally derived AtrxWT allele, leaving only the Atrxnull allele on the active maternal X ( Xm) and thereby render the extraembryonic tissues null for full - length Atrx protein.

Another surprising finding of this study is that, in carrier female embryos, a paternally inherited AtrxWT allele appears to escape the process of imprinted X - inactivation, which ordinarily silences the Xp chromosome in the extraembryonic compartment of female murine tissues [ 18].

Female mice carrying mutations of these genes on the maternally inherited X chromosome also die in utero, whereas females that inherit the mutation on the Xp chromosome survive.

One possibility is that, like some other X - linked genes, silencing of the Atrx gene on Xp is incomplete, such that there is always a low - level, leaky output of Atrx from a normally inactivated Xp chromosome in extraembryonic tissues.	"X	41	42	GO_ontology"	"chromosome	200	210	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""X"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}, {""token"": ""chromosome"", ""start_span"": 200, ""end_span"": 210, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
"Perhaps a more likely explanation for this phenomenon stems from experimental observations suggesting that imprinted X - inactivation is not imposed on all precursors of the mouse extraembryonic tissues: A subpopulation of cells may escape this process and make a random "" choice "" of which X chromosome will be inactivated."

ATR - X syndrome is the first human genetic disease known to be caused by mutations in a chromatin remodelling factor.

Any carrier female progeny of this cross will carry an AtrxWT allele on the Xp chromosome and an Atrxnull allele on the Xm chromosome.

Loss of APC is associated with stabilization of the cytosolic beta - catenin that ultimately results in its migration to the nucleus and activating a cascade of events leading to tumorigenesis.

Interestingly, in the mutant skin, in addition to diffuse membrane - bound localization as in the normal skin, cells with strong cytosolic beta - catenin localization were also observed frequently ( Figure 4H and 4H ').

In mutants, some of the K14 - expressing cells also showed strong cytosolic / nuclear beta - catenin staining, as observed in the mutant skin ( Figure 4Q, 4Q ', and 4R).

These cells were more like basal cells of the skin than TECs and were adjacent to the most immature looking cells that were showing strong nuclear and cytoplasmic beta - catenin staining ( Figure 6J).
