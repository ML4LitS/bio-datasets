BRCA1 and BRCA2 form discrete nuclear foci during the S phase and after exposure to DNA damaging agents [ 9, 10, 11].	"nuclear	30	37	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Cells lacking BRCA1 / 2 fail to form damage - induced subnuclear RAD51 foci with normal efficiency, suggesting that these proteins are required for the formation of recombinase complexes at the sites of DNA damage [ 20, 21].	"complexes	177	186	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""complexes"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 186, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
It is possible that RAD51 may alternatively be capable of BRCA2 - independent transport, but mislocalization of BRCA2 to the cytoplasm may sequester RAD51 and block its normal mode of transport.	"cytoplasm	125	134	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""cytoplasm"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Given the elaborate nature of the RAD51 - BRCA2 interaction, it seems somewhat unlikely that the only role of BRCA2 in promoting recombination is to serve as a specific nuclear transporter of RAD51.	"nuclear	169	176	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
In the absence of this interaction with BRCA2, RAD51 might exist in a form that is not capable of being recruited into a functional repair complex when damage occurs.	"complex	139	146	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""complex"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
BRCA2 may thus promote RAD51 assembly into recombinational repair complexes via a negative regulatory mechanism ( i. e. by blocking RAD51 - BRCA2 interaction until damage has occurred and factors required for ' productive ' assembly of RAD51 at damaged sites are in place).	"complexes	66	75	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""complexes"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
RAD51 paralogs in particular, including XRCC2, XRCC3, RAD51B, RAD51C and RAD51D, may function as a complex that actively promotes RAD51 assembly [ 31].	"complex	99	106	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""complex"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
The observation that BRCA2 localizes to damage - induced subnuclear foci with RAD51 seems consistent with the possibility that BRCA2 plays a positive role in assembly of the recombination complex [ 11].	"complex	188	195	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""complex"", ""start_span"": 188, ""end_span"": 195, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
It should be relatively straightforward to determine whether the role of BRCA2 is limited to transporting RAD51 to the nucleus.	"nucleus	119	126	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""nucleus"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
If this were the case, addition of a nuclear localization signal to RAD51 should suppress the RAD51 - mediated phenotypes associated with a BRCA2 mutation.	"nuclear	37	44	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
In this model, BRCA2 is not required for assembly of functional complexes at damaged sites, only to prevent a substantial fraction of Rad51 from being sequestered in a nonfunctional form.

The major findings in this study are: ( 1) disruption of only one of the two genes comprising the STSL locus is necessary and sufficient to cause sitosterolemia, ( 2) that the loss of Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 leads to the loss of biliary cholesterol secretion and ( 3) Abcg5 / sterolin - 1 appears to be still apically - expressed despite the absence of Abcg8 / sterolin - 2.

BC, basal cells; SP, spiral prominence epithelial cells; RC, root cells; OS, outer sulcus epithelial cells; VHC, vestibular hair cells; VTC, vestibular transitional cells; VDC, vestibular dark cells; arrows, basal cells at the top and bottom of stria vascularis form tight junctions with surface epithelial cells.

The extent of pendrin expression in spiral prominence cells and stria vascularis was determined by labeling KCNQ1, a K + channel that is expressed in strial marginal cells, and ZO - 1, a tight junction protein that labels basal cells and thereby delineates the boundaries of stria vascularis.

Using confocal immunocytochemistry on cryosections, we observed strong expression of the pendrin protein in the apical membrane of vestibular transitional cells in the utricle and ampullae ( Fig. 1g, 1h, 1i).

Dual labeling with KCNQ1 demonstrated that pendrin expression was clearly limited to vestibular transitional cells and did not extend to other non - sensory cells such as vestibular dark cells, which were clearly identified by the expression of KCNQ1 and KCNE1 in their apical membranes.

The potential is generated across the basal cell barrier of stria vascularis by the K + channel KCNJ10 located in intermediate cells [ 24], which are connected to basal cells by a high density of gap junctions [ 25].

In order to substantiate the view that stria vascularis in Slc26a4 - / - secretes K +, we measured the magnitude of the bumetanide - sensitive current exiting stria vascularis across the apical membrane of strial marginal cells and determined the expression of the proteins KCNQ1, KCNE1 and SLC12A2, which are essential for K + secretion [ 20, 32, 33], and of GJB2 ( Cx26), which is thought to contribute to K + cycling [ 23].

These observations make it unlikely that the primary cause of the loss of the endocochlear potential is a compromise of K + secretion by strial marginal cells or a compromise of gap junction mediated K + cycling.

Type I fibers are mitochondria - rich and mainly use oxidative metabolism for energy production, which provides a stable and long - lasting supply of ATP, and thus are fatigue - resistant.

Type IIb fibers have the lowest levels of mitochondrial content and oxidative enzymes, rely on glycolytic metabolism as a major energy source, and are susceptible to fatigue, while the oxidative and contraction functions of type IIa and IIx lie between type I and IIb ( Booth and Thomason 1991; Berchtold et al. 2000; Olson and Williams 2000).

To directly assess the role of activation of PPAR delta in control of muscle fiber plasticity and mitochondrial biogenesis, we generated mice expressing a transgene in which the 78 - amino - acid VP16 activation domain was fused to the N - terminus of full - length PPAR delta, under control of the 2. 2 - kb human alpha - skeletal actin promoter.

A diagnostic component of oxidative fibers is their high myoglobin and mitochondrial content, which is supported by the mRNA analysis shown in Figure 3A.	"mitochondrial	71	84	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""mitochondrial"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
In addition to myoglobin, mitochondrial components for electron transfer ( cytochrome c and cytochrome c oxidase [ COX] II and IV) and fatty - acid beta - oxidation enzymes were elevated ( Figure 3A; unpublished data).	"mitochondrial	26	39	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""mitochondrial"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
These effects appear to be direct consequences of PPAR delta activation, as levels of PGC - 1 alpha, a coactivator involved in muscle fiber switch and mitochondrial biogenesis ( Wu et al. 1999; Lehman et al. 2000; Lin et al. 2002), remained unchanged.

These results reveal a marked stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and further support the idea that there is a muscle fiber switch.	"mitochondrial	45	58	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""mitochondrial"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
In agreement with the chronic effects in the transgenic mice, we found that, after treatment of wild - type C57B6J mice with the PPAR delta - specific agonist GW501516 for only 10 d, genes for slow fiber contractile proteins, mitochondrial biogenesis, and beta - oxidation were all upregulated ( Figure 3E).

We show that targeted expression of an activated form of PPAR delta produces profound and coordinated increases in oxidation enzymes, mitochondrial biogenesis, and production of specialized type I fiber contractile proteins -- the three hallmarks for muscle fiber type switching ( Figure 6C).

"junctional	153	163	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""junctional"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 163, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
The multipotent, adhering epithelial cells are typically attached to an underlying basal lamina that polarizes the epithelial sheet and separates it from surrounding mesenchyme.	"basal lamina	83	95	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""basal lamina"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
The process must be accompanied by alterations in the proliferation, polarity, shape, and adhesiveness of selected cells, as well as by modifications in their underlying basal lamina.

Thus, extracellular epithelial - mesenchymal crosstalk must be intricately orchestrated to couple the determination of distinct cell fates with the contemporaneous remodeling of the physical and structural properties of the cell.

Bud formation differs from an EMT in that E - cadherin activity needs to be down - regulated but not prevented, so that adhesive junctions are remodeled rather than quantitatively impaired.	"junctions	129	138	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""junctions"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Although Snail family members are most frequently associated with EMTs, they also participate in many malignant processes involving a down - regulation but not a quantitative abrogation of intercellular junctions [ 18].

To determine whether this transient nature of Snail mRNA expression is reflected at the protein level, we generated an antibody against the N - terminal sequence that resides upstream of the more conserved zinc finger domains.	"antibody	119	127	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""antibody"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
As judged by Western blot analysis, the antibody did not detect endogenous proteins from cultured keratinocytes, but it did yield a band of the expected size from keratinocytes transiently expressing a hemagglutinin ( HA) - tagged Snail protein ( Figure 1B).	"antibody	40	48	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""antibody"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
The antibody also recognized a band corresponding to the size of endogenous Snail ( approximately 28 kDa) in lysates from embryonic mouse skin, the temporal appearance of which corresponded to the waves of hair follicle morphogenesis from E15. 5 to newborn when over 90% of the hair on the mouse is formed ( Figure 1B).

Consistent with the in situ hybridization results, anti - Snail antibody labeled only hair buds and not follicles at more mature stages of development ( Figure 1E).	"antibody	64	72	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""antibody"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Taken together, the anti - Snail antibody appeared to be specific for its target protein.	"antibody	33	41	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""antibody"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
As judged by immunohistochemistry, Snail protein was localized to the nuclei of the hair bud cells ( Figure 1E).	"nuclei	70	76	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""nuclei"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Immunohistochemistry with antibodies against the active ( phosphorylated) form of MAPK ( pMAPK) marked a subset of the proliferating ( Ki67 - positive) cells, and pMAPK - positive cells were enriched in the hair bud ( Figure 1G).	"antibodies	26	36	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""antibodies"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
The mosaic morphology was reflected at the level of Tg Snail protein, with only the hyperthickened regions expressing nuclear HA - tagged Snail ( Figure 2C).	"nuclear	118	125	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
The undulations were accompanied by partial dissolution of the underlying basement membrane ( Figure 3K and 3L).	"basement membrane	74	91	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""basement membrane"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Interestingly, similar types of alterations occur in the basement membrane in the hair bud of embryonic and newborn mice when Snail is normally expressed.	"basement membrane	57	74	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""basement membrane"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
The fact that the basement membrane separating the epidermis from the dermis is altered only in the adult Tg animals suggests the involvement of intermediary factors not as readily available in the epidermis as they are in the follicle.

Possible Links between Epidermal Hyperproliferation and Down - regulation of AJ Proteins in Snail Tg Mice	"AJ	77	79	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""AJ"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Given that the E - cadherin promoter is a direct target for Snail - mediated repression in vitro [ 4, 12, 13], and that E - cadherin was down - regulated in Snail - expressing hair buds, we examined the status of E - cadherin and other AJ proteins within regions of hyperproliferative epidermis where Tg Snail was present ( Figure 4A).	"AJ	236	238	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""AJ"", ""start_span"": 236, ""end_span"": 238, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
A priori, the decrease in alpha - catenin levels could be due to either direct transcriptional repression by Snail or perturbations in AJ formation caused by the decrease in E - cadherin gene expression.	"AJ	135	137	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""AJ"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
As shown in Figure 4C, transiently transfected keratinocytes expressing HA - tagged Snail displayed a loss of E - cadherin and alpha - catenin at cell - cell borders.	"cell - cell borders	146	165	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""cell - cell borders"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 165, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
In this respect, the skin epithelium resembled that of the hair bud, where the down - regulation in junction proteins is permissive for cell - cell remodeling without abrogating intercellular adhesion.	"junction	100	108	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""junction"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
The similarities between Snail Tg epidermis and hair buds extended to the hyperproliferative state, leading us to wonder whether the down - regulation of AJ proteins might contribute to this condition.	"AJ	154	156	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""AJ"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Numerous studies have correlated a down - regulation of E - cadherin with a translocation of beta - catenin to the nucleus and a transactivation of genes that are regulated by the LEF - 1 / T cell factor ( TCF) family of DNA binding proteins [ 23, 24, 25].	"nucleus	115	122	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""nucleus"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
The presence of nuclear cyclin D in hyperproliferative Snail Tg epidermis was particularly intriguing since prior studies have reported cyclin D gene as a direct target of TCF / beta - catenin transcription [ 26].	"nuclear	16	23	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
This said, we did not detect nuclear beta - catenin in our Tg epidermis, and mating the Snail Tg mice against the TOPGal reporter mouse [ 20] gave no signs of ectopic LEF - 1 / Tcf / beta - catenin activity ( unpublished data).	"nuclear	29	36	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
We next turned to the presence of cytoplasmic Ajuba for a possible mechanistic link to the proliferative increase in our Snail Tg epidermis.	"cytoplasmic	34	45	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""cytoplasmic"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
These data suggested that by elevating cytosolic Ajuba levels, Ajuba ' s pre - LIM domain may associate with Grb - 2 / Sos in a manner that stimulates its nucleotide exchange activity and leads to activation of the Ras - MAPK pathway.	"cytosolic	39	48	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""cytosolic"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Although this pathway provides one mechanism by which Snail expression and proliferation may be coupled in skin epithelium, proliferative circuitries involving AJs are known to be complex and often interwoven.	"AJs	160	163	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""AJs"", ""start_span"": 160, ""end_span"": 163, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
A variety of extracellular signals have an impact on the cell type - specific expression of different Snail family members, and many of them, including Wnts, BMPs, FGFs, and TGF - beta s, also affect hair bud development [ 2, 16, 28].	"extracellular	13	26	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""extracellular"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Consistent with previous observations [ 33], an anti - TGF - beta 2 antibody labeled developing hair buds ( Figure 6A).	"antibody	68	76	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""antibody"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
As shown in Figure 6I and 6J, both WT and TGF - beta 2 null buds exhibited nuclear LEF - 1 and beta - catenin localization, signs that the Wnt - noggin signaling pathway was intact.	"nuclear	75	82	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""nuclear"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Recent studies on hair bud morphogenesis suggest that Wnt signals likely from the epithelium and BMP inhibitory signals from the underlying mesenchyme converge to produce an active transcription factor complex involving beta - catenin and LEF - 1, which in turn plays a key role in specifying the hair follicle fate [ 4, 29, 30, 36, 37].	"transcription factor complex	181	209	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""transcription factor complex"", ""start_span"": 181, ""end_span"": 209, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Additional contributing factors could be the multiplicity of Snail family members and their differential expression, the saturation, and / or diversity of regulatory mechanisms that govern AJ formation, migration, and proliferation in the follicle ORS.	"AJ	189	191	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""AJ"", ""start_span"": 189, ""end_span"": 191, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Because the timing of this event correlated with the activation of a LEF - 1 / beta - catenin transcription factor complex [ 20], we were intrigued by the presence of a putative LEF - 1 / TCF binding site in the E - cadherin promoter.	"transcription factor complex	94	122	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""transcription factor complex"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Our Tg studies suggested that, at least in part through its regulation of E - cadherin, Snail is able to influence the subcellular localization of a variety of AJ - associated proteins.	"AJ	160	162	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""AJ"", ""start_span"": 160, ""end_span"": 162, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
The corresponding abilities of either Snail - transfected or Ajuba - transfected keratinocytes to exhibit elevated activation of the Ras - MAPK pathway suggest that the Grb - 2 association of Ajuba under conditions of reduced levels of AJ proteins may be directly relevant to the parallel in hyperproliferation.	"AJ	236	238	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""AJ"", ""start_span"": 236, ""end_span"": 238, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Irrespective of these differences, our in vivo studies do not stand alone, as there are many situations in which a down - regulation in AJ proteins correlate with enhanced proliferation.

In a previous study, we demonstrated that forced expression of a dominant - negative allele of Crx in developing rods blocked formation of both rod spherules in the outer plexiform layer ( OPL) and outer segments [ 7].

To expand on these studies, the ultrastructure of photoreceptor synapses was examined in Crx - / - retinas.	"synapses	64	72	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""synapses"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
The sperules were blunt or club - shaped structures with a single ribbon associated with a single invaginating synapse ( Figure 7A, arrow indicates one example; Figure 8A and 8B).	"synapse	111	118	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""synapse"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"

Mutations in Crx represent one of a collection of gene mutations that lead to an outer segment formation defect.	"outer segment	81	94	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""outer segment"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Homozygous null mutations in the peripherin / RDS gene [ 36] or in rhodopsin [ 29] lead to a failure of outer segment formation.	"outer segment	104	117	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""outer segment"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Vesicular structures in Crx - / - photoreceptors were observed that were similar to those previously noted in the rds / peripherin - / - mouse.	"Vesicular structures	0	20	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Vesicular structures"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Strong support in favor of the former explanation was provided by Nir and colleagues who demonstrated the presence of rhodopsin protein in these vesicles using immunoelectron microscopy against a rhodopsin epitope [ 37].	"vesicles	145	153	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""vesicles"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Peripherin / RDS and ROM - 1 proteins ( localized in disc rims) and the opsin proteins ( localized throughout the discs) have important roles in the structural integrity of mature outer segments ( see [ 39, 29]).	"outer segments	180	194	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""outer segments"", ""start_span"": 180, ""end_span"": 194, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
ROM - 1 - / - mice produce disorganized outer segments with large disks [ 40].	"outer segments	40	54	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""outer segments"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Crx, by virtue of being a transcription factor, presumably controls genes that are responsible for the building and perhaps maintenance of the outer segment structure, including rhodopsin and peripherin.	"outer segment structure	143	166	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""outer segment structure"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 166, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
In ninaE null mutants, the rhabdomere, a structure analogous to vertebrate outer segments, fails to develop in R1 - R6 photoreceptors [ 42], reminiscent of the situation in rhodopsin - / - mice [ 29].	"rhabdomere	27	37	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""rhabdomere"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
[ 43] demonstrated a temporal requirement for rhodopsin expression during rhabdomere development.	"rhabdomere	74	84	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""rhabdomere"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
However, expression shortly before or after this critical period failed to rescue, suggesting that rhodopsin expression during a discrete window of time in development is essential for proper rhabdomere morphogenesis.	"rhabdomere	192	202	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""rhabdomere"", ""start_span"": 192, ""end_span"": 202, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Thus, through its regulation of rhodopsin levels, or perhaps through control of the kinetics of the up - regulation of rhodopsin beginning at about P6, Crx may be regulating outer segment morphogenesis.	"outer segment	174	187	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""outer segment"", ""start_span"": 174, ""end_span"": 187, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
They include enzymes that are important in lipid metabolism, protein folding and transport, as well as in other processes that one might envision would be important in building a structure such as the outer segment.

Future analyses of the function of these genes might reveal their role in outer segment biogenesis.	"outer segment	74	87	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""outer segment"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
However, the spontaneously occurring mouse mutant in CRB1, the Rd8 mouse, develops shortened outer segments that subsequently degenerate [ 48], suggesting that photoreceptor polarization and synaptogenesis are intact in this mutant.

The Crx - / - mouse demonstrates the most severe abnormality of photoreceptor synapses reported to date.	"synapses	78	86	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""synapses"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
The peripherin - / - mouse develops a normal complement of photoreceptor terminals which then degenerate as the photoreceptors are lost [ 30].	"terminals	73	82	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""terminals"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Also, similarly in rhodopsin ( Rho) and cyclic nucleotide - gated channel, alpha - 3 ( CNGA3) double knockout mice ( Rho - / -, CNGA3 - / -), synapses are reported to form normally [ 49].	"synapses	142	150	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""synapses"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
These observations demonstrate that photoreceptor synaptogenesis can occur in the absence of outer segment formation.	"outer segment	93	106	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""outer segment"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
In keeping with this observation is the fact that some electroretinogram activity is present in peripherin - / - mice, suggesting that minimal phototransduction is present in these mice, enough to drive activity at the photoreceptor synapse.	"synapse	233	240	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""synapse"", ""start_span"": 233, ""end_span"": 240, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
A more likely explanation is that Crx plays a role in photoreceptor synapse formation, perhaps by regulating directly, or indirectly, important genes in this process.	"synapse	68	75	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""synapse"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Tags from three genes from proteins expressed in photoreceptor terminals were found to be decreased in a statistically significant fashion, namely the HGF - regulated tyrosine kinase substrate, the CRIPT protein, and synaptotagmin 1 ( Blackshaw and Cepko, unpublished data).	"terminals	63	72	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""terminals"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
An example of a gene that was increased in the Crx - / - retina is HRG4 ( a homologue of the C. elegans Unc119 gene) ( Blackshaw and Cepko, unpublished data) which encodes a component of the ribbon synapse [ 33].

The fact that it is upregulated might indicate a response to the lack of proper terminal structures.	"terminal	80	88	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""terminal"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Several other genes encoding putative cytoskeletal elements also were increased ( e. g. microtubule associated protein 4) or decreased ( e. g. cofilin 1) in the Crx - / - retina, with P values of <. 005.

Also photoreceptor terminals were perturbed in laminin beta2 mutants, but again the phenotype was more subtle then that of Crx - / - mice.	"terminals	19	28	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""terminals"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
The majority of known genes responsible for human genetic blindness, encode proteins expressed almost exclusively, or exclusively, in photoreceptors, particularly in the outer segment [ 35].

In the current study, we present data that argue that, in addition to outer segment morphogenesis, synaptogenesis may also be critically impaired in at least a subset of LCA.

Recent evidence points toward a transcriptional coactivator, peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - gamma ( PPAR gamma) coactivator - 1 alpha ( PGC - 1 alpha), as an integrator of the molecular regulatory circuitry involved in the transcriptional control of cellular energy metabolism, including mitochondrial function and biogenesis [ 1, 2].

PGC - 1 alpha is distinct among most coactivators in that it exhibits a tissue - enriched expression pattern and is highly inducible by physiologic conditions known to increase the demand for mitochondrial ATP or heat production [ 2, 6, 7].

Third, studies in primary cardiac myocytes in culture and in the hearts of transgenic mice have demonstrated that overexpression of PGC - 1 alpha promotes mitochondrial biogenesis [ 10, 16].

PGC - 1 alpha protein was not detected in whole cell ( Figure 1E) or nuclear protein extracts ( unpublished data) isolated from BAT of PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice under basal conditions or in response to cold exposure, a condition known to markedly induce the expression of PGC - 1 alpha in BAT.

These results suggest that PGC - 1 alpha is not necessary for the induction of the expression of UCP - 1 with cold exposure, and that other factors, such as reduced capacity for mitochondrial respiration, likely contribute to the abnormal thermogenic response in the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice.

Next, we performed experiments to determine whether the reduced capacity for fat oxidation in the hepatocytes of the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice was related to altered mitochondrial respiratory function.

Using targeted gene deletion in mice, we show here that PGC - 1 alpha is not essential for normal embryologic development or the fundamental events of mitochondrial biogenesis.

Taken together, these results strongly suggest that PGC - 1 alpha is necessary for the terminal stages of mitochondrial maturation necessary to meet the energy demands of the postnatal environment.

Surprisingly, the reduction in fatty acid oxidation rates in PGC - 1 alpha null hepatocytes was not due to altered expression of PGC - 1 alpha / PPAR target genes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation.

Consistent with the former possibility, recent evidence indicates that PGC - 1 alpha coactivates the nuclear receptor FXR, a negative regulator of SREBP - 1c expression and triglyceride synthesis [ 33].

We conclude that reduced hepatocyte mitochondrial respiratory capacity, and possibly activation of lipogenic programs, result in hepatocyte triglyceride accumulation in the context of increased hepatic delivery of fatty acids such as occurs with fasting.

We first defined an ETS transcription regulator that is able to replace the function of Er81 within proprioceptive afferents to direct projections into the ventral spinal cord.	"projections	135	146	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""projections"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Nevertheless, when introduced into the Er81 locus in analogy to a previously used targeting strategy ( data not shown; [ 14]), neither Pea3 nor Erm could rescue Ia proprioceptive afferent projections to extensively invade the ventral horn of the spinal cord ( data not shown).	"projections	188	199	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""projections"", ""start_span"": 188, ""end_span"": 199, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
In addition, to analyze axon ingrowth independent of the level of PV expression in DRG neurons, we used anterograde labeling of afferent fibers by applying fluorescently labeled dextran to cut dorsal roots ( Figure 2D - 2F).	"axon	24	28	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""axon"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Using both assays, we found extensive rescue of the projections into the ventral horn of the spinal cord in Er81EWS - Pea3 / - mice ( Figure 2C and 2F).	"projections	52	63	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""projections"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Within the ventral horn, Ia afferents in both wild - type and Er81EWS - Pea3 / - mice formed vGlut1 + terminals that were absent in Er81 mutant mice ( Figure 2G - 2I).	"terminals	102	111	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""terminals"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Together, these findings suggest that in the absence of Er81, EWS - Pea3 can direct the complex biological process of correct laminar termination within the ventral spinal cord and the formation of synapses with motor neurons ( Figure 2J - 2L), thus identifying an ETS transcription factor suitable for heterochronic expression experiments in DRG neurons.

We first assessed the influence of EWS - Pea3 expression in early post - mitotic DRG neurons on the establishment of afferent projections into the spinal cord using the TaumGFP / + allele or a Thy1 - promoter - driven synaptophysin green fluorescent protein ( spGFP) with an expression profile restricted to DRG sensory neurons at embryonic day ( E) 13. 5 ( Thy1spGFP; [ 25]) ( Figure 3).

In contrast to wild - type proprioceptive afferent projections ( Figure 3A - 3C), GFP + sensory afferents in TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos failed to invade the spinal cord and instead were found in an extreme lateral position at the dorsal root entry zone, a phenotype observed at least up to E18. 5 ( Figure 3A - 3C and 3G - 3I; data not shown).	"projections	51	62	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""projections"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
We next visualized the path of sensory afferent projections towards the dorsal root entry zone in TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos by injecting fluorescently labeled dextran into an individual DRG ( L3; n = 3; Figure 3M - 3Q).	"projections	48	59	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""projections"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
While rostro - caudal projections were present in TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos, afferent fibers failed to approach the midline at distal segments and continued to occupy an extreme lateral position ( Figure 3O), consistent with the analysis of transverse sections.

Our data indicate that DRG neurons undergo a temporal change in their competence to respond to ETS transcription factor signaling, as assessed by changes in gene expression and axonal target invasion ( Figure 9).

In contrast, upon precocious induction of ETS signaling, we found more pronounced defects in the establishment of central rather than peripheral projections for all DRG neurons.

Induction of Er81 expression in proprioceptive afferents is controlled by peripheral NT - 3 as axons reach the vicinity of target muscles, and thus occurs only approximately 3 d after proprioceptive neurons become post - mitotic [ 9, 14].

Mechanisms such as chromosomal remodeling that restrict or expand access to certain target genes [ 34] or activation by cofactors responsible for changing the action of particular transcription factors [ 35] could represent possible mechanisms by which the downstream transcriptional profile of a transcription factor could be temporally shifted towards the selection and control of distinct target genes.

Moreover, the observed transcriptional shift in ETS signaling is paired with the onset of appropriate regulation of neuronal subtype specification and establishment of axonal projections into the target area.

If one ( or more) Tas2rs underlie the chromosome 6 QHCl taste sensitivity QTL, we would predict that one ( or more) Tas2r genes would exhibit one of three likely characteristics: ( 1) A Tas2r allele is a pseudogene, or is deleted, in D2 ( QHCL - insensitive), but not B6 ( QHCl - sensitive), mice; ( 2) Missense mutations in the single coding exon of a D2 Tas2r allele impact protein functions such as ligand binding or receptor coupling to downstream signaling cascades; ( 3) Mutations in noncoding or regulatory regions of a D2 Tas2r allele affects expression of the protein product.

We propose that the interaction of PAX6 with HOMER3 and DNCL1 is a mechanism by which synaptic activation could lead to changes in neuronal transcriptional activity, and that some of the neural anomalies in patients with PAX6 mutations could be explained by impaired protein - protein interactions.

The roles of PAX6 in brain development have mainly been studied in homozygous mutant mice or rats and include arealisation of the cerebral cortex [ 7], formation of the prosencephalon - mesencephalon boundary [ 8], axon guidance [ 8], differentiation of neurons from glia [ 9] and neuronal migration in the cerebellum [ 10].

However it is interesting to speculate that the interaction of PAX6 with HOMER3 and DNCL1 may be the basis of a mechanism by which synaptic signalling causes changes in gene expression.

gamma H2AX localized normally to the XY body of DMRT7 mutant cells in meiotic spreads ( Figure 7A), and many gamma H2AX - positive puncta were present in germ cells of Dmrt7 mutant testes ( Figure 7B).

Although the XY body can form during pachynema in Dmrt7 mutants, we considered the possibility that transcriptional silencing might not be properly established.	"XY body	13	20	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""XY body"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
We therefore asked whether the pachytene germ cell death in Dmrt7 mutants is associated with a failure either to initiate or to maintain sex chromosome inactivation.

In Dmrt7 mutants, the XY body was formed and excluded Cot - 1 hybridization ( Figure 8B), indicating that transcriptional silencing is established normally in mutant pachytene cells.	"XY body	22	29	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""XY body"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
We also examined expression of the Y - linked gene Rbmy, which normally is inactivated during pachytene and reactivated after secondary meiosis begins [ 54, 55].	"Y	35	36	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""Y"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"

We next considered the possibility that sex chromatin is established normally but is not properly modified as cells exit pachynema and begin to form PMSC.	"sex chromatin	40	53	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""sex chromatin"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
We also examined three epigenetic signatures of PMSC: histone H3 dimethylated or trimethylated at lysine - 9 ( H3 - 2meK9, H3 - 3meK9) and spreading of HP1 beta through the XY body [ 16, 57, 58] ( S.

We observed defects in sex chromatin localization of all three markers in Dmrt7 diplotene cells.	"sex chromatin	23	36	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""sex chromatin"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Although HP1 beta localization to the X chromosome centromere initially appeared normal at mid - pachynema, we observed Dmrt7 mutant diplotene cells that failed to show spreading of HP1 beta to the entire XY body ( Figure 8G and 8H).	"XY body	205	212	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""XY body"", ""start_span"": 205, ""end_span"": 212, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Similarly, we found Dmrt7 mutant diplotene cells lacking accumulation of H3 - 2meK9 and H3 - 3meK9 marks onto the sex chromatin ( Figure 8I - 8L).	"sex chromatin	114	127	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""sex chromatin"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Not all Dmrt7 mutant diplotene cells showed abnormal localization of HP1 beta to the sex chromatin ( Figure 8M).	"sex chromatin	85	98	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""sex chromatin"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
In one experiment, 11 / 27 mutant cells in diplonema lacked HP1 beta on the XY body, as compared with 2 / 22 wild - type cells.	"XY body	76	83	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""XY body"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
We did not observe sex chromatin defects prior to diplonema, but we cannot exclude the possibility that earlier defects exist and the affected cells are rapidly eliminated.	"sex chromatin	19	32	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""sex chromatin"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
In the preceding experiments, we staged cells based on XY body internalization.	"XY body	55	62	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""XY body"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
This independently identified Dmrt7 mutant diplotene cells lacking HP1 beta accumulation in the XY body, such as the example in Figure 9B.	"XY body	96	103	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""XY body"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
XY chromosome pairs are indicated by arrow.	"chromosome	3	13	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""chromosome"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
In males, DMRT7 expression is highest in pachytene spermatocytes, and the protein preferentially localizes to the XY body.	"XY body	114	121	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""XY body"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
The pachytene stage of prophase involves tremendous chromosomal changes as the homologs align, synapse, and recombine.	"chromosomal	52	63	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""chromosomal"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
We found that chromosomal synapsis and recombination appear normal in Dmrt7 mutant cells.	"chromosomal	14	25	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""chromosomal"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
We therefore focused on the XY body, the most prominent site of DMRT7 accumulation.	"XY body	28	35	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""XY body"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
First, we tested whether the XY body forms and MSCI is established in Dmrt7 mutant cells.	"XY body	29	36	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""XY body"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Moreover, Cot - 1 hybridization and analysis of RBMY expression demonstrated that MSCI initiates normally in the XY body of mid - pachytene Dmrt7 mutant cells.	"XY body	113	120	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""XY body"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
We did, however, observe three specific defects in the sex chromatin of Dmrt7 mutant germ cells that avoided arrest in pachynema and were able to enter diplonema.	"sex chromatin	55	68	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""sex chromatin"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Normally cells accumulate H3 - 2meK9 and H3 - 3meK9 marks and HP1 beta protein on the sex chromatin as they progress to diplonema, but we observed mutant diplotene cells lacking these features.	"sex chromatin	86	99	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""sex chromatin"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Thus, although a minority of Dmrt7 mutant germ cells can progress from pachynema to diplonema, there are defects in sex chromatin modification during the transition.	"sex chromatin	116	129	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""sex chromatin"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
A function in male sex chromatin can reconcile the findings that DMRT7 is required for meiosis, but only in males, and is present only in mammals.	"male sex chromatin	14	32	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""male sex chromatin"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
A proportion of mutant diplotene cells have apparently normal sex chromatin ( for example, Figure 8M); these are likely to be the cells that can progress beyond diplonema.	"sex chromatin	62	75	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""sex chromatin"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Alternatively, apoptosis and abnormal sex chromatin may be two independent consequences of Dmrt7 loss.	"sex chromatin	38	51	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""sex chromatin"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
A number of other proteins have been identified that interact with the XY body, including histone variants and modified histones, a testis - specific histone methyl transferase, chromobox proteins, an orphan receptor germ - cell nuclear factor, and recombination - related proteins [ 60].	"XY body	71	78	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""XY body"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
A common feature of these proteins is involvement with heterochromatin and / or transcriptional repression.	"heterochromatin	55	70	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""heterochromatin"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
DMRT7 is unusual among XY body proteins in being related to highly site - specific transcriptional regulators.	"XY body	23	30	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""XY body"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
It will be of interest to determine whether DMRT7 localizes to sex chromosomes during monotreme meiosis.	"sex chromosomes	63	78	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""sex chromosomes"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"

Western blot analysis, using a polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide encoded by exon 3, revealed multiple species in wild - type and heterozygous testes, one of which corresponds to the expected size of 48 kDa ( Figure 1E).

To determine the germ cell types in which TRIP13 is expressed, and to assess possible expression in the mutant by means other than Western analysis, testis sections were immunolabeled for TRIP13 using a polyclonal chicken antipeptide antibody ( see Materials and Methods).

Since we observed oocytes with pachytene stage chromosomes in 17. 5 d Trip13Gt / Gt embryonic ovaries ( unpublished data), this indicates that oocytes were eliminated somewhere between pachynema and dictyate.

More prepubertal ( 17. 5 d postpartum) mutant spermatocytes contained asynaptic or terminally asynapsed chromosomes than age - matched controls ( 62. 5% versus 25%, respectively; Figure 4B).

Nevertheless, since Trip13Gt / Gt spermatocytes progress to pachynema with no gross SC abnormalities, and oocytes were eliminated soon after birth ( a characteristic of DNA repair mutants [ 13]), this suggested that unrepaired DSBs are responsible for eventual meiotic arrest and elimination.

The cohesin complex, which is essential for completion and / or maintenance of synaptic associations, appeared to assemble normally as judged by immunolabeling for the meiosis - specific cohesins STAG3 ( Figure S2C and S2D) and REC8 ( unpublished data).

Because yeast PCH2 localizes to telomeres in a Sir3p - dependent manner, we tested for possible telomere defects by immunolabeling for TRF2, a component of a protein complex that plays an essential role in telomere protection [ 19].

For RAD51 / DMC1, mutant pachytene spermatocytes contained 138 +/- 6 foci ( compared to 11 +/- 3 foci in wild type, most of which were on the XY body), down from 218 +/- 13 in zygonema ( compared to 220 +/- 13 foci in wild type).

The persistence of BLM on Trip13Gt / Gt spermatocyte chromosomes suggests that at least a subset of the unrepaired DSBs correspond to sites of defective NCO recombinational repair.	"chromosomes	53	64	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""chromosomes"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
To assess whether CO recombination occurs in the mutant, we examined the distribution of the mismatch repair proteins MLH1 and MLH3, which are normally detectable as foci in mid - late pachynema and mark the locations of chiasmata [ 30, 31].

Whereas all of the Dmc1 - / - spreads had ~ 35 or more condensed chromosomes, all of the + / + and Trip13Gt / Gt spreads had 20 - 25, suggesting that the MLH1 / 3 foci in Trip13Gt / Gt pachytene spermatocytes represent sites of completed, or near - completed, COs.	"condensed chromosomes	55	76	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""condensed chromosomes"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Spermatocytes in Trip13Gt / Gt Spo11 - / - testes progressed maximally to that point before undergoing death ( Figs 3I), well before the spindle checkpoint that eliminates achiasmate spermatocytes [ 36].	"spindle	137	144	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""spindle"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
In contrast to the complete synapsis in Trip13Gt / Gt pachytene spermatocytes ( Figure 5A), in which SPO11 is available in leptonema to initiate ( via DSB induction, Figure S2A and S2B) a recombination - driven homolog search, chromosome synapsis in doubly mutant spermatocytes was highly disrupted as in Spo11 single mutants ( Figure 5B and 5C).

Identical studies were performed with mice deficient for Mei1, a vertebrate - specific gene also required for DSB formation and chromosome synapsis [ 37], with similar results ( Figure 3J and 3K; immunocytology not shown).

Since Zip2p is present at sites of axial associations, even in zip1 mutants, it has been suggested that Zip2p promotes initiation of chromosome synapsis [ 38].	"chromosome	133	143	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""chromosome"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Meiotic chromosomes of Rec8 mutant spermatocytes undergo apparent homolog pairing and interhomolog synaptic initiation, but are defective in DSB repair and fail to maintain interhomolog synapsis [ 39, 40].

Immunocytological analysis indicated that both Dmc1 - / - and Dmc1 - / - Trip13Gt / Gt chromosomes had extensive asynapsis compared to Trip13Gt single mutants ( Figure 5F - 5H), and all had persistent RAD51 / DMC1 foci and phosphorylated H2AX ( gamma H2AX; Figure 5I - 5L), confirming that Dmc1 is epistatic to Trip13.	"chromosomes	87	98	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""chromosomes"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Interestingly, RAD54 - deficient spermatocytes display abnormal persistence of RAD51 foci on pachytene chromosomes, similar to those in TRIP13 mice, but there are no deleterious effects on meiotic progression or fertility [ 49].	"chromosomes	103	114	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""chromosomes"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Because synapsis occurs in TRIP13 - deficient spermatocytes and is dependent on DSB formation ( activity of SPO11 and MEI1), we suggest that TRIP13 functions after homology recognition and strand exchange, and that recombination events entering the CO repair pathway are either completed or nearly so ( because OA treated resulted in bivalent chromosomes).	"chromosomes	343	354	GO_ontology"	"[{""token"": ""chromosomes"", ""start_span"": 343, ""end_span"": 354, ""type"": ""GO_ontology""}]"
Notably, TRIP13 has two putative ATPase domains, a signature of AAA - ATPase ClpA / B chaperones that perform protein or protein / DNA complex disassembly [ 52].

To reach conclusions on the pattern of staining for various proteins, 30 ( unless otherwise indicated) well - spread nuclei of particular meiotic stages were first identified under the fluorescent microscope on the basis of SYCP3 or STAG3 staining, then imaged at both appropriate wavelengths to determine the pattern of second proteins with focal patterns such as RAD51 or RPA.
