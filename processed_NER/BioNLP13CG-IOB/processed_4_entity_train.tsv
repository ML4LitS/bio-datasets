Based on these optimized parameters, a prototype diagnostic / treatment system was designed that captures high - speed indocyanine green ( ICG) angiogram images and facilitates analysis of the images by enhancing visualization of dye movement through CNV feeder vessels ( FVs).

In addition to direct effects on mammary epithelial cells, including decreased proliferation and induction of apoptosis, CLA may exert its effects indirectly by inhibiting the differentiation of mammary stromal cells to an endothelial cell type.

This effect appears to be mediated, in part, by decreased expression of vascular endothelial ( VE) - cadherin by endothelial cells in the presence of TIMP - 3 as seen both in an in vitro assay and in TIMP - 3 - overexpressing tumors.

We further show that down - regulation of caspase 3 via overexpression of RASSF1C reduces breast cancer cells ' sensitivity to the apoptosis inducing agent, etoposide.

The 13C enrichment of cell metabolites was examined after a 4 - h incubation in media containing 5. 5 mM glucose and 11 mM lactate, each metabolite being alternatively labelled with either [ 1 - 13C] D - glucose or [ 3 - 13C] L - lactate.
