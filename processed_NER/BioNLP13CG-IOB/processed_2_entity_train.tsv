Vascular histomorphometry was carried out in two different areas in the distraction gap: ( 1) in the first and ( 2) in the second 1 mm area from the osteotomy line, representing the oldest and younger new - bone area, respectively.

The volume density of blood vessels between the two investigated areas was significantly lower in the 1 mm / day groups, suggesting a delay in angiogenesis in this group of patients.

This correlation was due to a higher number of blood vessels rather than to a larger size of the blood vessels.

Cell lines were established from tumor and metastases and kept in culture for more than 2 months.	"Cell lines	0	10	Cell"	"tumor	33	38	Cancer"	"[{""token"": ""Cell lines"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""tumor"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Cancer""}]"
Furthermore, we determined the ability of U - 995 to inhibiting tumor cell growth and metastasis.	"U - 995	42	49	Gene_or_gene_product"	"tumor cell	64	74	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""U - 995"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""tumor cell"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Moreover, U - 995 ( 30 micrograms / ml) markedly prevented collagenase - induced collagenolysis.	"U - 995	10	17	Gene_or_gene_product"	"collagenase	59	70	Gene_or_gene_product"	"[{""token"": ""U - 995"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""collagenase"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"
