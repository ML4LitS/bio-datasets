Now, by competition experiments with a panel of different unlabelled cells we show that the VCSA expressed on RSV - transformed hamster fibroblasts is a complex of at least three distinct antigenic specificities: ( 1) one expressed on all RSV - transformed fibroblasts, regardless their species and the subgroup or strain of the transforming virus; ( 2) one cross - reacting with a cell - surface antigen ( CSA) expressed at various degrees on untransformed avian fibroblasts, but not on mammalian fibroblasts; ( 3) one species - specific, present only on RSV - transformed hamster fibroblasts.	cells,69,74,Cell	VCSA,92,96,Gene_or_gene_product	RSV,110,113,Organism	hamster,128,135,Organism	fibroblasts,136,147,Cell	RSV,239,242,Organism	fibroblasts,257,268,Cell	virus,342,347,Organism	cell - surface antigen,382,404,Gene_or_gene_product	CSA,407,410,Gene_or_gene_product	avian,458,463,Organism	fibroblasts,464,475,Cell	mammalian fibroblasts,488,509,Cell	RSV,556,559,Organism	hamster,574,581,Organism	fibroblasts,582,593,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""VCSA"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""RSV"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""hamster"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""fibroblasts"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 147, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""RSV"", ""start_span"": 239, ""end_span"": 242, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""fibroblasts"", ""start_span"": 257, ""end_span"": 268, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""virus"", ""start_span"": 342, ""end_span"": 347, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""cell - surface antigen"", ""start_span"": 382, ""end_span"": 404, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""CSA"", ""start_span"": 407, ""end_span"": 410, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""avian"", ""start_span"": 458, ""end_span"": 463, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""fibroblasts"", ""start_span"": 464, ""end_span"": 475, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""mammalian fibroblasts"", ""start_span"": 488, ""end_span"": 509, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""RSV"", ""start_span"": 556, ""end_span"": 559, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""hamster"", ""start_span"": 574, ""end_span"": 581, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""fibroblasts"", ""start_span"": 582, ""end_span"": 593, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
