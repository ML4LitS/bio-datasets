HYPOTHESIS: We speculate that there is a burst of angiogenesis of distant dormant micrometastases after surgery in approximately 20% of premenopausal node - positive patients.

However, VEGF has also been shown to be neuroprotective across several experimental paradigms, and hence could potentially protect vulnerable cells from damage associated with seizures.

Apparently, several in vivo phosphorylation sites were recognized in vitro in both large T - antigen and p53, but the presence of some artifactual sites could not be completely excluded.
