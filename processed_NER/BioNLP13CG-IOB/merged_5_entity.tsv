The heightened sensitivity of VHL - deficient cells was not attributed to dissimilar energy requirements or to differences in glucose uptake, but more likely reflects a lesser ability of VHL - deficient cells to handle abnormally processed proteins arising from impaired glycosylation.

In support of this hypothesis, other treatments which act through different mechanisms to interfere with protein processing ( i. e., tunicamycin, brefeldin A, and azetidine) were also found to be much more toxic for VHL - deficient cells.	tunicamycin,133,144,Chemical	brefeldin A,146,157,Chemical	azetidine,163,172,Chemical	VHL,216,219,Gene_or_gene_product	cells,232,237,Cell	"[{""token"": ""tunicamycin"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""brefeldin A"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""azetidine"", ""start_span"": 163, ""end_span"": 172, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""VHL"", ""start_span"": 216, ""end_span"": 219, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 232, ""end_span"": 237, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
