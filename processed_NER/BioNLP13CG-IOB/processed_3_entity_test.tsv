These observations support the importance of ER in Ras - mediated cell transformation.

Gene therapy for gliomas: p53 and E2F - 1 proteins and the target of apoptosis.

We have previously shown that massive apoptosis occurs when wild - type p53 or E2F - 1 expression is induced in glioma.

However, the transfer of either the p16 or Rb gene to glioma cells results in cytostatic effect.
