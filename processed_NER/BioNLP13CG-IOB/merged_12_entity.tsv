Our findings suggest with a reduction of steroid hormones following ovariectomy, alternatively activated macrophage markers ( Fizz1 and Ym1) were reduced, with this effect being reversed with the administration of estrogen or progesterone; suggesting that with the reduction of steroid hormones macrophages are activated in a classical manner, promoting inflammation, whereas estrogen or progesterone are contributing toward macrophage activation in an alternative manner, driving wound repair, angiogenesis, and remodeling.	steroid hormones,41,57,Chemical	macrophage,105,115,Cell	Fizz1,126,131,Gene_or_gene_product	Ym1,136,139,Gene_or_gene_product	estrogen,214,222,Chemical	progesterone,226,238,Chemical	steroid hormones,278,294,Chemical	macrophages,295,306,Cell	estrogen,376,384,Chemical	progesterone,388,400,Chemical	macrophage,425,435,Cell	wound,481,486,Pathological_formation	"[{""token"": ""steroid hormones"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""macrophage"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Fizz1"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""Ym1"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""estrogen"", ""start_span"": 214, ""end_span"": 222, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""progesterone"", ""start_span"": 226, ""end_span"": 238, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""steroid hormones"", ""start_span"": 278, ""end_span"": 294, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 295, ""end_span"": 306, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""estrogen"", ""start_span"": 376, ""end_span"": 384, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""progesterone"", ""start_span"": 388, ""end_span"": 400, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""macrophage"", ""start_span"": 425, ""end_span"": 435, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""wound"", ""start_span"": 481, ""end_span"": 486, ""type"": ""Pathological_formation""}]"	test
RESULTS: Our data showed that: tuberous sclerosis 2 ( TSC2) and phosphatase and tensin homolog ( PTEN) were downregulated in most of the primary tumors, and their low expression was significantly associated with shorter disease - free and overall survival; somatostatin receptor 2 ( SSTR2) was absent or very low in insulinomas compared with nonfunctioning tumors; and expression of fibroblast growth factor 13 ( FGF13) gene was significantly associated with the occurrence of liver metastasis and shorter disease - free survival.	tuberous sclerosis 2,31,51,Gene_or_gene_product	TSC2,54,58,Gene_or_gene_product	phosphatase and tensin homolog,64,94,Gene_or_gene_product	PTEN,97,101,Gene_or_gene_product	tumors,145,151,Cancer	somatostatin receptor 2,257,280,Gene_or_gene_product	SSTR2,283,288,Gene_or_gene_product	insulinomas,316,327,Cancer	tumors,357,363,Cancer	fibroblast growth factor 13,383,410,Gene_or_gene_product	FGF13,413,418,Gene_or_gene_product	liver,477,482,Organ	"[{""token"": ""tuberous sclerosis 2"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""TSC2"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""phosphatase and tensin homolog"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""PTEN"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""tumors"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Cancer""}, {""token"": ""somatostatin receptor 2"", ""start_span"": 257, ""end_span"": 280, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""SSTR2"", ""start_span"": 283, ""end_span"": 288, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""insulinomas"", ""start_span"": 316, ""end_span"": 327, ""type"": ""Cancer""}, {""token"": ""tumors"", ""start_span"": 357, ""end_span"": 363, ""type"": ""Cancer""}, {""token"": ""fibroblast growth factor 13"", ""start_span"": 383, ""end_span"": 410, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""FGF13"", ""start_span"": 413, ""end_span"": 418, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""liver"", ""start_span"": 477, ""end_span"": 482, ""type"": ""Organ""}]"	test

The antiproliferative effect of HAH - cortisol on endothelial cells appeared independent of the glucocorticoid activity of the steroid since HAH conjugated to 5 beta - pregnane - 3 alpha, 17 alpha, 21 - triol - 20 - one, a steroid lacking glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid activity, was even more effective at inhibiting DNA synthesis by murine pulmonary capillary endothelial cells than was HAH - cortisol.
