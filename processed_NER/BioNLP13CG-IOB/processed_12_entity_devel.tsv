This restriction enzyme site polymorphism along with the sequence variations were also observed in 50 biopsy tissues as well as in the throat washings of 6 out of 20 healthy individuals that we examined, indicating that the EBV strain predominantly existing in these biopsy tissues was different from strains of B95 - 8, Jijoye or nude mouse passaged cells ( C15) with an African origin, but closely resembled other nude mouse passaged CAO cells which were originally derived from China.

To explore the potential of chemotherapy directed at the tyrosine kinase of p185neu, we have found that emodin ( 3 - methyl - 1, 6, 8 - trihydroxyanthraquinone), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, suppresses autophosphorylation and transphosphorylation activities of HER - 2 / neu tyrosine kinase, resulting in tyrosine hypophosphorylation of p185neu in HER - 2 / neu - overexpressing breast cancer cells.
