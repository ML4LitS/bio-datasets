In this location, it interacts with other proteins of the focal adhesion to activate intracellular signalling events associated with cell adhesion.

Because these phenomena are all of critical importance during morphogenesis, and because FAK is expressed in embryonic cells, evidence has been accumulating to indicate that FAK may be an important modulator of developmental processes.
