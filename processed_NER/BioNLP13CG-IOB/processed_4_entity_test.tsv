This effect is mediated, at least in part, by a decrease in TTF - 1 activity, since transient or stable expression of RhoA QL results in a reduction in the activity of the wild - type Tg promoter as well as an artificial promoter the activation of which depends exclusively on TTF - 1.

Since then, important progress has been made with respect to the understanding of the role of the Pten protein in the normal development of the brain as well as in the molecular pathogenesis of human gliomas.

Experimental flaps were found to be perfused fully with fluorescein and lead oxide; control fat pads were found not to be perfused.

The p16 / Rb / E2F pathway is the most frequent target of genetic alterations in gliomas, and therefore constitutes a suitable target for gene therapy strategies.

In addition, p21 - or p16 - mediated growth arrest did not protect glioma cells from E2F - 1 - mediated apoptosis.

Accordingly, the rate of elimination of abnormal proteins was lower in cells lacking a functional VHL gene than in wtVHL - expressing cells.
