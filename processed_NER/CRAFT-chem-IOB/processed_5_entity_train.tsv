To assess whether these MLH1 / 3 foci in Trip13Gt / Gt pachytene spermatocytes represent CO events completed to a point where they could maintain interhomolog attachments though the end of prophase I, we treated testicular cells from 17. 5 - 20. 5 - d - old control ( + / +), Trip13Gt / Gt, and Dmc1 - / - mice with the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid ( OA), a chemical that induces degradation of the SC, chromosome condensation, and premature progression to metaphase I [ 33].
