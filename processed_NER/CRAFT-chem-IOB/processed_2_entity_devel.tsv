The human gene MCOLN1 ( GenBank # AF287270) maps to chromosome 19p13. 2 - 13. 3 and encodes a novel protein that is a member of the transient receptor potential ( TRP) cation channel gene superfamily [ 7 - 10].

However, for all of these mechanisms -- white spotting, pigment - type switching, and melanosome biogenesis -- more is known about the identity of the molecular components than their spatial and temporal control.

Secreted by dermal papilla cells within each hair follicle ( Millar et al. 1995), Agouti protein causes melanocytes in that follicle to switch from the production of brown / black eumelanin to red / yellow pheomelanin.

Furthermore, dorsoventral differences in pigmentation can represent differences in the number and / or differentiated state of pigment cells, as well as the type of pigment synthesized in response to expression of Agouti.	"pigment	41	48	Chemical"	"pigment	127	134	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""pigment"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""pigment"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Differences between dorsal and ventral pigmentation of at / at mice are usually attributed to pigment - type differences caused by ventral - specific expression of Agouti, but animals homozygous for a null allele of Agouti, extreme nonagouti ( ae), have ventral hairs that contain less melanin than dorsal hairs, giving a slightly paler appearance to the ventral coat ( Figure 1G).	"pigment	39	46	Chemical"	"melanin	286	293	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""pigment"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""melanin"", ""start_span"": 286, ""end_span"": 293, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
By contrast, skin from at / at mice reveal an abrupt dorsoventral transition of DOPA staining, which probably reflects the additive effects of reduced melanin content ( as in ae / ae mice) and downregulation of tyrosinase activity induced by Agouti.	"DOPA	80	84	Chemical"	"melanin	151	158	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""DOPA"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""melanin"", ""start_span"": 151, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Melanin content of individual hairs is likely to be influenced both by the number of pigment cells and their follicular environment.

Thus, at least three characteristics distinguish dorsal from ventral skin: differences in pigment - type synthesis ( depending on Agouti genotype), differences in hair length, and differences in melanin content.

Indeed, slight differences between the regions of transition for pigment - type switching and pigment content give rise to a subtle yellow stripe along the flank ( see Figures 1, 2, and 9A).

Levels of Agouti mRNA remain high throughout the entire ventrum, but hair pigment content is reduced, giving rise to a cream - colored region in the ventrum that, depending on age and genetic backgrounds, may appear more or less distinct from the yellow flank stripe.

( Ectopic pigmentation of the ventral footpads that develops in En1 mutant mice is unrelated to pigment - type synthesis and instead likely reflects a requirement for En1, independent of Wnt7a, to repress migration or proliferation ( or both) of pigment cells in ventral epidermis [ Cygan et al. 1997; Loomis et al. 1998].)

In contrast to the doubling of cholesterol in the lungs of wild type embryos ( 1. 82 mg / g tissue at E13. 5 to 3. 55 mg / g tissue at P0), cholesterol content in the lungs of Dhcr7 null embryos remained at almost constant low levels between E13. 5 and P0 gestational stages ( Fig. 5).

Shh is critical for normal embryonic development and its autoprocessing, resulting in a cholesterol molecule covalently attached at its C - terminus, is a necessary step for its regulated signaling function [ 23, 34].

Since Shh expression, as well as some of the Shh signaling components appeared to be normal in Dhcr7 - / - embryos, endogenous autoprocessing of Shh to generate a cholesterol - modified N - terminal fragment of Shh ( Shh - Np) was evaluated.

Transfection of COS cells with the constitutive truncated Shh - N cDNA led to two slower migrating bands that correspond to truncated Shh, but which are thought to be generated by differences in lipid modifications, as previously demonstrated [ 35].

Although these genetic studies now implicate the need for normal cholesterol synthesis, the mechanistic role ( s) of cholesterol in normal embryonic development remains to be clarified.

In support of normal differentiation of type II AECs, no alteration in the gene expression patterns for surfactant proteins A, B, C or D was noted, nor was the pattern of distribution of SP - C altered in lungs from knockout embryos.

Thus, it is possible that the cholesterol levels ( roughly 50% of normal levels) in Dhcr7 - / - embryos were enough for completion of Shh autoprocessing or 7DHC accumulated in Dhcr7 - / - embryonic tissues can also participate efficiently as a sterol adduct in the Shh processing reaction [ 20].

Since the loss of cholesterol content in the plasma membrane ( and perhaps any membrane) is likely to alter the function of receptors more sensitive to this, loss of normal cholesterol synthesis may cause a loss of signal transduction of a host of such pathways.

To determine whether dopamine D2 receptor - mediated signaling contributes to associative and reversal learning, we compared C57Bl / 6J mice that completely lack functional dopamine D2 receptors to wild - type mice with respect to their ability to attach appropriate salience to external stimuli ( stimulus discrimination) and disengage from inappropriate behavioral strategies when reinforcement contingencies change ( e. g. reversal learning).

However, the dopamine D2 receptor deficient mice required significantly more trials than wild - type mice to discriminate between two dishes, each filled with a different scented sand, and to associate one of the two odors with the presence of a reinforcer ( food).

Despite a growing literature demonstrating disrupted associative learning following acute manipulations of dopamine D1R signaling during acquisition of associative learning tasks with food [ e. g.

While D2R antagonists have been used in the context of rodent associative learning paradigms, their lack of receptor subtype specificity [ 13] and motor - disrupting effects [ 6, 8] have prevented a rigorous examination of the actual role this dopamine receptor subtype plays in associative and reversal learning in the context of an operant behavior.

Past experiments seeking to explore the possible involvement of dopamine D2Rs in associative learning have utilized low to moderate doses of drugs [ 2, 5, 6] and site - specific administration [ 7, 9] in order to avoid the confounding effect that locomotor disruption associated with acute D2R blockade can have on learning performance in rodents.

In an effort to establish the contribution of dopamine D2 receptor - mediated signaling to associative and non - spatial reversal learning in adult mice, we compared mice [ 23] that had developed in the complete absence of all functional dopamine D2 receptors ( D2R - / -) to wild - type littermates ( D2R + / +) in a go / no - go operant learning procedure that measures primary reinforcement, sensory processing, and reversal learning [ 17 - 19].

The deficient capacity of D2R - / - mice to disengage inappropriate decision strategies strongly argues that mesolimbic dopamine signaling, mediated by dopamine D2Rs is essential for efficient reversal learning to occur.

Our results add to a growing literature demonstrating a negligible role of dopamine, and now, specifically, D2Rs in the unconditioned or hedonic value of natural ( food) reinforcers [ 1, 2].

Most literature reviews identify dopamine D1Rs with dopamine - mediated learning and D2Rs with motor related behaviors [ e. g. [ 24]].

Moreover, it has been reported that acute administration of the dopamine D2 / 3 antagonist, raclopride, actually improves acquisition of food - motivated associative learning [ 6].

That D2R - mediated signaling orchestrates just motor components of learning is a conclusion that is potentially biased due to the practice of avoiding doses of drugs that induce catalepsy ( and therefore measuring only partial blockade of dopamine D2Rs) and single administrations [ e. g. [ 3]].

However, the realization that multiple dopamine receptor subtypes would be concurrently targeted with the presently commercially available antagonists, such as D2Rs, D3Rs, and D4Rs would have to be rectified.

Recent electrophysiological data demonstrate that dopamine D2R ' s are located on glutamatergic terminal axons of olfactory nerves and depress excitatory input of the olfactory nerve to the mitral cells of the olfactory bulb [ 30, 31].

These findings are significant because D2R - / - mice respond to food reinforcers and ultimately form and maintain odor - driven S + / S - relationships ( a putative D1R - mediated behavior [ 6]) just as D2R + / + mice ( both groups achieved >= 80% discrimination accuracy, the dopamine D1Rs in our mice were not targeted).

Nonetheless, the inability of D2R - / - mice to disengage from previously established S + / S - contingencies ( responding to a discriminative stimulus; Fig. 4) strongly argues that mesolimbic dopamine, and in particular dopamine D2R - mediated signaling, modulates the process of alerting the subject that familiar contingencies are now associated unexpected consequences.

Therefore, we suggest that during associative learning or when unexpected reinforcement outcomes are modified ( reversal learning) dopamine - driven reinforcement impulses involve signaling mediated by dopamine D2Rs.

Possibly, the lack of dopamine D2R - mediated signaling prevents refinement of the corticostriatal reinforcement circuits in the brains of the D2R - / - mice, thus impairing their ability to form S + / S - contingencies and disengage inappropriate dopamine D1R - mediated associative responding when unexpected consequences to goal - directed behaviors happened.

Dopamine D2R - / - and D2R + / + mice ( n = 8 per group) were initially trained to ambulate the length of a polyvinyl mouse cage ( 30 - cm) to retrieve ~ 30 - mg of Pico (R) fat supplemented rodent food located in a small plastic cup ( 3 - cm) attached to the floor of the testing apparatus with Velcro.

Significantly, sequence and phylogenetic analysis of coiled coil proteins ( Fig. 1) clearly shows that RHAMM does not contain a TACC domain and instead forms a distinct family of proteins in the coiled coil superfamily, and is not a direct descendant of the ancestral TACC gene.

In the case of the C. elegans TAC protein, this structure comprises the majority of the protein and is encoded by two of the three exons of the gene.

TACC3 can be divided into three sections: a conserved N - terminal region ( CNTR) of 108 amino acids, encoded by exons 2 and 3 in each vertebrate TACC3 gene, the conserved TACC domain distributed over the final seven exons, and a highly variable central region.

These repeats are not evident in the rabbit protein, or any other TACC protein, and may indicate that the rodent TACC3 has evolved distinct functions, as has already been noted for the amphibian Xenopus TACC3, maskin [ 8].

The protein and genomic structure of the present day TACC family members suggests that the function of the ancestral TACC protein was mediated solely through the interactions of the conserved TACC domain.

Thus, it is known that all the TACC proteins examined to date interact, via the TACC domain, with the microtubule / centrosomal proteins of the stu2 / msps / ch - TOG family [ 5, 6, 22 - 24], and with the Aurora kinases [ 20, 21, 25].

Similarly, large scale proteomics [ 29] has shown that Drosophila TACC interacts with two proteins, the RNA binding protein TBPH and CG14540 ( Fig. 6B), and thus indirectly with the Drosophila SWI / SNF chromatin remodeling complex and DNA damage repair machinery.	"proteins	90	98	Chemical"	"protein	116	123	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""proteins"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
For the DTACC interacting proteins, TBPH corresponds to TDP43, a protein implicated in transcriptional regulation and splicing [ 31, 32].

However, the assignment of the human homologue of CG14540 is less clear, with the closest matches in the human databases corresponding to glutamine rich transcription factors such as CREB and the G - box binding factor.

Many of these proteins do not appear to interact directly with the protostome TACCs, but would be expected to be in the same protein complex ( Fig. 6C, 6D).

From this analysis, it seems likely that the vertebrate TACC3 protein has retained this direct ancestral function, based upon its location in these structures during mitosis [ 27], its strong interaction with Aurora Kinase A, and the observation that it is the only human TACC protein phosphorylated by this enzyme [ 21].

For instance, in X. laevis, the maskin protein has acquired a binding site for the eIF4E protein, and thus a function in the coordinated control of polyadenylation and translation in the Xenopus oocyte [ 8, 35].

Significantly, RXR beta is a close family relative of the nuclear hormone receptor, nhr - 86, from C. elegans, which interacts with the ceTAC binding protein lin36 ( Fig. 6A).

This suggests that while protostome TACCs may require additional protein factors to interact with such components, the TACCs in higher organisms may have evolved the ability to directly interact with some of the proteins in the predicted interaction map ( Fig. 6E).

Thus, where the ceTAC protein is only composed of the TACC domain, the significantly larger TACC family members in higher protostomes and deuterostomes may have integrated one or more functions of the bridging protein ( in this case lin15A, lin36 or lin37).

Indeed, the first assigned function of a vertebrate TACC protein, mouse TACC3, was as a transcriptional coactivator of the ARNT mediated transcriptional response to hypoxia and polyaromatic hydrocarbons [ 7].

Recently, we have demonstrated that TACC2 and TACC3 can bind to nuclear histone acetyltransferases [ 34], further confirming a more direct role for the TACC proteins in transcriptional and chromatin remodeling events.

As well as the full - length ATRX protein of ~ 280 kDa, which is encoded by a transcript of ~ 10 kb, we recently demonstrated that a truncated isoform called ATRXt ( ~ 200 kDa) is produced from a transcript of around 7 kb, which arises when intron 11 fails to be spliced from the primary transcript and an alternative intronic poly ( A) signal is used [ 4].
