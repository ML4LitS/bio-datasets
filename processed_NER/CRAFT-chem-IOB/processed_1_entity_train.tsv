This conversion of muscle fiber from type IIb to type IIa and type I is likely to be mediated by a calcium signaling pathway that involves calcineurin, calmodulin - dependent kinase, and the transcriptional cofactor Peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - gamma coactivator 1 alpha ( PGC - 1 alpha) ( Naya et al. 2000; Olson and Williams 2000; Lin et al. 2002; Wu et al. 2002).

We found that transforming growth factor beta 2 signaling is necessary to transiently induce the transcription factor Snail and activate the Ras - mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK) pathway in the bud.	"protein	167	174	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 167, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
When E - cadherin is transcriptionally down - regulated, associated adhesion proteins with dual functions in signaling are released from cell - cell contacts, a process which we demonstrate leads to Ras - MAPK activation.

Through activation of cell surface transmembrane receptors, these external signaling molecules trigger distinct cascades of intracellular events that culminate in changes in gene expression, growth, and differentiation [ 2].

However, the process appears to be patterned at the initial stages of bud formation, since the relative importance of these pathways and their downstream effectors differ as buds begin to develop and cell fates are specified.

Although the temporal spike of Snail in the hair bud is reflected at the mRNA level and seems to follow Wnt signaling and BMP inhibition, LEF - 1 / beta - catenin activation does not appear to induce Snail gene expression in embryonic skin keratinocytes.

In contrast, we provide in vitro, transgenic ( Tg), and gene targeting evidence to show that TGF - beta 2 and small phenotype - and mothers against decapentaplegic - related protein 2 ( SMAD2) signaling are upstream inducers of Snail gene expression in skin epithelium.

Although the failure of Snail - null mice to develop past gastrulation [ 21] precluded our ability to study the loss of Snail function in skin development, a good correlation emerged between the expression of Snail protein and the extension of K5, Ki67, and pMAPK suprabasally ( compare data in Figures 2 and 3).

Given that the E - cadherin promoter is a direct target for Snail - mediated repression in vitro [ 4, 12, 13], and that E - cadherin was down - regulated in Snail - expressing hair buds, we examined the status of E - cadherin and other AJ proteins within regions of hyperproliferative epidermis where Tg Snail was present ( Figure 4A).	"proteins	239	247	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""proteins"", ""start_span"": 239, ""end_span"": 247, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
In contrast, the intensity of antibody staining for two other AJ proteins, beta - catenin and Ajuba, was still strong.	"proteins	65	73	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""proteins"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
However, in regions such as ear skin, where the highest levels of Snail protein were expressed, the effects were accentuated.	"protein	72	79	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Coexpression of exogenous HA - tagged E - cadherin not only enabled cell - cell border localization of E - cadherin protein, but also rescued the cell - cell border staining of alpha - catenin ( Figure 4C).	"protein	116	123	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Rather, the findings are consistent with a previous report that E - cadherin is required for the translation of alpha - catenin mRNA [ 22].	"mRNA	128	132	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""mRNA"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
In this respect, the skin epithelium resembled that of the hair bud, where the down - regulation in junction proteins is permissive for cell - cell remodeling without abrogating intercellular adhesion.	"proteins	109	117	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""proteins"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
The similarities between Snail Tg epidermis and hair buds extended to the hyperproliferative state, leading us to wonder whether the down - regulation of AJ proteins might contribute to this condition.	"proteins	157	165	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""proteins"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 165, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Together, these findings raised the possibility that an AJ - associated protein that is normally sequestered at the plasma membrane may participate in a proliferation signaling pathway when AJs are deconstructed.	"protein	72	79	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Numerous studies have correlated a down - regulation of E - cadherin with a translocation of beta - catenin to the nucleus and a transactivation of genes that are regulated by the LEF - 1 / T cell factor ( TCF) family of DNA binding proteins [ 23, 24, 25].	"proteins	233	241	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""proteins"", ""start_span"": 233, ""end_span"": 241, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Interestingly, Ajuba was readily detected in anti - Grb - 2 immunoprecipitates of protein lysates from skins of Snail Tg mice but not from the corresponding wild - type ( WT) animals ( Figure 4E).	"protein	82	89	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
When these experiments were repeated with alpha - catenin - null epidermis, a similar Grb - 2 - Ajuba association was detected, and again, this interaction was not detected in the protein extracts from control littermate skin ( Figure 4E).	"protein	180	187	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 180, ""end_span"": 187, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
"This activation was abolished when cells were treated with a small peptide inhibitor that specifically interrupts the Grb - 2 / Sos interaction ( Figure 4F; see lanes marked "" inh "") [ 27]."	"inhibitor	75	84	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""inhibitor"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
As expected, the small peptide inhibitor that interrupts the Grb - 2 / Sos association blocked the effects.	"inhibitor	31	40	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""inhibitor"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
These data suggested that by elevating cytosolic Ajuba levels, Ajuba ' s pre - LIM domain may associate with Grb - 2 / Sos in a manner that stimulates its nucleotide exchange activity and leads to activation of the Ras - MAPK pathway.

The temporal spike of Snail mRNA expression in the hair bud prompted us to consider what factor ( s) may be regulating the Snail gene.	"mRNA	28	32	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""mRNA"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Previously, we showed that effective transmission of a Wnt - 3a signal in cultured keratinocytes can be achieved through their exposure to the BMP inhibitor noggin, which induces LEF - 1 expression [ 4].	"inhibitor	147	156	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""inhibitor"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Following this treatment, Snail protein was detected within 30 min, peaked at 2 h, and then declined thereafter.	"protein	32	39	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
By contrast, although TGF - beta receptor activation remained elevated during the duration of the experiment ( as measured by the sustained phosphorylation of the downstream effector SMAD2) Snail expression could not be maintained ( Figure 5B).	"effector	174	182	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""effector"", ""start_span"": 174, ""end_span"": 182, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
The rapid kinetics of Snail expression were reflected at the mRNA level, suggesting that Snail promoter activity in keratinocytes might be sensitive to TGF - beta 2 signaling ( Figure 5C).	"mRNA	61	65	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""mRNA"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
At 2 d after transient transfection, keratinocytes were treated with TGF - beta 2 ( t = 0) and then assayed for transgene activity over the same time course in which we had observed Snail protein induction.	"protein	188	195	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 188, ""end_span"": 195, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
The kinetics of Snail promoter activity closely paralleled those observed for Snail protein induction.	"protein	84	91	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Moreover, the stimulatory effects appeared to be specific to TGF - beta 2, since they were abrogated either by heat inactivation of the TGF - beta 2 protein or by mutation of a putative SMAD binding element located about 1. 8 kb 5 ' from the Snail transcription start site ( Figure 5D).	"protein	149	156	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 149, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Taken together, these results suggested that in keratinocytes, TGF - beta 2 signaling results in a pSMAD2 - dependent transient activation of the Snail gene, and that maintenance of Snail protein relies, in part, upon sustained promoter activity.	"protein	188	195	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 188, ""end_span"": 195, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Moreover, the downstream effector of TGF - beta 2 signaling, pSMAD2, was also expressed in WT, but not TGF - beta 2 - null, hair buds ( Figure 6B).	"effector	25	33	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""effector"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
As judged by immunohistochemistry, Snail protein was absent from E17. 5 skin of TGF - beta 2 - null embryos but not from that of control littermates ( Figure 6C).	"protein	41	48	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
This effect appeared to be exerted at the transcriptional level, since Snail mRNAs were also not found in TGF - beta 2 null hair buds under conditions in which the signal was readily detected in the hair buds of littermate skin ( Figure 6D).	"mRNAs	77	82	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""mRNAs"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Conversely, in 2 - wk - old K14 - Smad2 Tg mice, which display elevated TGF - beta signaling in skin [ 35], Snail protein was readily detected by Western blot analyses, where it was not found in postnatal skin ( Figure 6E).	"protein	114	121	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Hence, when TGF - beta 2 protein was detected at the transition between the growing and destructive phases of the adult hair cycle, research initially and naturally focused on a role for this family member in cessation of growth and / or triggering apoptosis ( [ 42] and references therein).	"protein	25	32	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Our Tg studies suggested that, at least in part through its regulation of E - cadherin, Snail is able to influence the subcellular localization of a variety of AJ - associated proteins.	"proteins	176	184	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""proteins"", ""start_span"": 176, ""end_span"": 184, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
The corresponding abilities of either Snail - transfected or Ajuba - transfected keratinocytes to exhibit elevated activation of the Ras - MAPK pathway suggest that the Grb - 2 association of Ajuba under conditions of reduced levels of AJ proteins may be directly relevant to the parallel in hyperproliferation.	"proteins	239	247	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""proteins"", ""start_span"": 239, ""end_span"": 247, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Irrespective of these differences, our in vivo studies do not stand alone, as there are many situations in which a down - regulation in AJ proteins correlate with enhanced proliferation.

In fact, a myriad of diverse mechanisms have been implicated in activating epithelial proliferation upon down - regulation of AJ proteins [ 7, 23, 24, 48].	"proteins	129	137	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""proteins"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"

Recent evidence points toward a transcriptional coactivator, peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - gamma ( PPAR gamma) coactivator - 1 alpha ( PGC - 1 alpha), as an integrator of the molecular regulatory circuitry involved in the transcriptional control of cellular energy metabolism, including mitochondrial function and biogenesis [ 1, 2].

To test the hypothesis that a temporal delay in the onset of transcriptional programs is crucial for the control of appropriate neuronal maturation, we studied the development of proprioceptive DRG neurons, since transcriptional effectors regulated by target - derived signals, as well as some of their downstream biological actions, have been identified for these neurons.

In addition, to analyze axon ingrowth independent of the level of PV expression in DRG neurons, we used anterograde labeling of afferent fibers by applying fluorescently labeled dextran to cut dorsal roots ( Figure 2D - 2F).

Mechanisms such as chromosomal remodeling that restrict or expand access to certain target genes [ 34] or activation by cofactors responsible for changing the action of particular transcription factors [ 35] could represent possible mechanisms by which the downstream transcriptional profile of a transcription factor could be temporally shifted towards the selection and control of distinct target genes.

Because of their proximity to the linked marker, their demonstrated expression in taste receptor cells, and their role in the detection of at least some bitter - tasting compounds, we hypothesized that one or more of the 24 Tas2rs at this locus were responsible for the major QHCl taste sensitivity QTL.

Using 17 RI lines and 762 chromosomal markers, we have restricted the quinine taste QTL to a < 5 Mb region on distal chromosome 6 that contains 24 Tas2r genes.	"quinine	70	77	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""quinine"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"

For example, the BXD RI lines exhibited a range of quinine sensitivity, with several strains having similar sensitivities to that of B6, some strains with sensitivities similar to that of D2, and a third group with a more intermediate phenotype ( Figures 1, 7).	"quinine	51	58	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""quinine"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"

Also, a suggestive QTL on chromosome 8 does not contain any Tas2r genes, but does contain a number of genes encoding ion channels, enzymes and members of other receptor families ( our unpublished data).

It will be interesting to determine whether this suggestive QTL is linked to quinine taste and, if so, whether it is specific for this single bitter stimulus or more broadly related to all bitter taste.

While increasing the number of BXD RI lines or the number of markers used for genotyping them would facilitate the definition of smaller QTL intervals, in this case such an effort is unlikely to permit the identification of one or a few Tas2rs involved in quinine taste.

We subjected the whole PAX6 PST domain to secondary structure analysis using JPRED, a program that uses a number of different protein structure prediction algorithms to generate a consensus secondary structure ( Figure 1) [ 25, 26].	"protein	126	133	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
The PST domain was largely devoid of predicted secondary structure except for the C - terminal region, which contained two predicted beta sheets within the highly conserved domain, one in the ' GLISP ' motif and one in the ' SPVPQ ' motif ( identical to the pattern shown in Figure 1c).	"C	82	83	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""C"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Initially we defined the C - terminal domain as running from the ' GLISP ' motif up to the stop codon, since this region was most highly conserved and contained strongly predicted secondary structure elements.

However when we performed secondary structure prediction analysis on this 28 amino acid peptide, the first beta sheet was lost ( Figure 1b).	"amino acid	77	87	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""amino acid"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"

Having confirmed that HOMER3, DNCL1 and TRIM11 interact with the PAX6 PST domain, we next investigated how the interactions were affected by three C - terminal PAX6 mutations that have been previously described in patients with ocular anomalies.	"C	32	33	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""C"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
The three mutations were introduced into the PAX6PST construct, and pairwise tests were carried out to investigate the interaction of each mutant protein with HOMER3, DNCL1 and TRIM11.

Since receptor activation causes dissociation of HOMER proteins [ 35], PAX6 may be released as a result of synaptic activity, allowing it to interact with DNCL1.	"proteins	55	63	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""proteins"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"

Although the full - length PAX6 protein is predominantly nuclear, there is good evidence in mouse, quail and nematode for an isoform that lacks the paired domain, is both nuclear and cytoplasmic, and binds DNA through the homeodomain alone [ 49 - 51].	"protein	32	39	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Regarding the subcellular localisation of the putative interacting proteins, HOMER3 is predominantly found at the interface between the PSD and the cytoplasm [ 39], DNCL1 is chiefly cytoplasmic, although nuclear localisation has been reported [ 51], and TRIM11 is both nuclear and cytoplasmic [ 38].	"proteins	67	75	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""proteins"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Therefore cytoplasmic PAX6 could potentially interact with all three proteins, while nuclear PAX6 could interact with TRIM11 and DNCL1.	"proteins	69	77	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""proteins"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"

Consistent with the idea that cells in this primordium are poised between two developmental pathways, some of the genes that are involved in establishing sexual dimorphism, including Dax1 ( dosage - sensitive sex reversal - congenital adrenal hypoplasia critical region on the X chromosome protein 1), Sox9 ( Sry - like HMG box 9), Fgf9 ( fibroblast growth factor 9), and Wnt4 ( wingless - related MMTV integration site 4), are initially expressed in similar patterns in XX and XY gonads [ 3 - 8].

Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that up - regulation of SOX9 occurs in this case in the absence of Sry, by eliminating the antagonistic effect of Wnt4 and up - regulating FGF9, supporting our hypothesis that sex determination occurs by tipping the balance between these two opposing signals.

Sex - specific regulation of gonad organogenesis in vertebrates may occur in a similar manner, where some cells are cell - autonomously responsive to the sex - determining switch; however, the establishment of the male or female program occurs through the non - cell - autonomous activity of classic signaling pathways that act in an antagonistic manner and coordinate growth, cell differentiation and morphogenesis in the gonad.

Surprisingly, the fusion of GFP to p53 apparently altered p53 stability: steady - state levels of p53GFP were much higher than those of wild - type p53 ( p53WT) in unstressed cells, and did not vary significantly after DNA damage, so that the levels for both p53WT and p53GFP were similar after adriamycin treatment ( Figure 3A).

RanBP2 associates in vitro and in vivo and colocalizes with the mitochondrial metallochaperone, Cox11, and the pacemaker of glycolysis, hexokinase type I ( HKI) via its leucine - rich domain.

Then, we probed whether RanBP2 induces impairment of gluconeogenesis, which could contribute to the pathophysiological production and clearance of glucose.	"glucose	147	154	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Thus, we were concerned that differences in electroretinogram amplitudes between RanBP2 + / - and RanBP2 + / + may reflect differences in glucose level changes in response to anesthesia.

However, we found no significant differences in glucose levels measured before and every 15 min during 75 min of anesthesia ( n = 4 - 5).	"glucose	48	55	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"

This is reflected by a reduction of the Vmax of HKI without significantly affecting the Km of the active site of HKI toward glucose ( Figure 2A and 2B).	"glucose	124	131	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
"The sub - stochiometry effect of the LD of RanBP2 over the inhibition of HKI by Cox11 supports that a LD - dependent chaperonin - like mechanism underlies the suppression of Cox11 - dependent inhibition of HKI by RanBP2, and that RanBP2 acts as a molecular "" buffer "" over HK1 and Cox11 activities."

The data support that the ultimate pathophysiological outcome in HKI, caused by a reduction in RanBP2 levels and its chaperone activity, is the selective degradation of HKI as reflected by the reduced levels of HKI ( and ATP) but not of other mitochondrial and NPC components ( Figure 5).

These include the enhancement of the biogenesis of red / green opsin by the combination of the RBD4 - CY domains [ 6, 7] and the stabilization by the Ran - binding domains of RanBP2 of the guanosine triphosphate - bound conformational state of RanGTPase and interaction of Ran with importin - beta [ 11, 40, 41].

In this regard, it will be interesting to probe whether parkin also causes deficits in HKI in dopaminergic neurons, since parkin was reported to modulate RanBP2 turnover [ 20], and parkin loss - of - function also causes energy and growth deficits [ 26 - 29, 42].

This is further evidenced by the presence of genetic modifiers in RanBP2 + / - mice on a mixed genetic background that compensates for deficits in RanBP2 and deregulation of its partners in glucose / energy homeostasis as observed in the coisogenic line.

For example, the unfolding and chaperone activity of components of the 19S cap of the proteasome may be modulated by the CLD of RanBP2 [ 14] and contribute to the selective HKI ( and other substrates) degradation [ 43], while association of nuclear import receptor, importin - beta with the Ran - binding domains of RanBP2 [ 10, 11], may mediate the nuclear translocation of multifunctional substrates, such as glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase.
