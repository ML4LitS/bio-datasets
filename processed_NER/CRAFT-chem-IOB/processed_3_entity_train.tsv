However, there is evidence for both receptor - dependent and - independent transduction mechanisms for a number of bitter stimuli, including quinine hydrochloride ( QHCl) and denatonium benzoate ( DB).

Two families of G protein - coupled receptors ( GPCRs) expressed in subpopulations of taste receptor cells ( TRCs) of the gustatory epithelium have been implicated in the detection and transduction of sweet, bitter and umami ( i. e., glutamate) taste: T1Rs for sweet - and umami - tasting stimuli [ 1 - 8], and T2Rs for bitter - tasting compounds [ 9 - 11].

Furthermore, a number of physiological studies have suggested that the transduction of some amphiphilic bitter compounds, such as quinine and denatonium benzoate, may stimulate taste receptor cells independently of GPCRs ( e. g.

This QTL maps to the same chromosomal position as a previously identified QTL for quinine intake, Qui [ 16, 28], indicating that taste is the major factor in regulating quinine aversion.

At least 60 other genes also lie within this interval, including two genes that encode proline - rich salivary proteins, Prp2 and Prh1; these proteins appear to play no direct role in bitter taste [ 48].

We used sequence alignment algorithms and secondary structure prediction programs to define a new domain of 32 amino acids at the C - terminal end of the PAX6 protein.

BLAST analysis of the amino acid sequence of the PAX6 PST domain ( aa 278 - 422) revealed a highly conserved motif within the last 28 amino acids ( beginning at the ' GLISP ' motif, Figure 1a).

By library screening we identified two proteins ( HOMER3 and DNCL1) that interact with the C - terminal peptide and three proteins ( HOMER3, DNCL1 and TRIM11) that interact with the whole PST domain.

In library screens, HOMER3 and DNCL1 interacted with the C - terminal peptide and the PST domain while TRIM11 interacted only with the PST domain, suggesting that HOMER3 and DNCL1 specifically interact with the C - terminal peptide while TRIM11 interacts with a more N - terminal part of the PST domain.

We were not able to confirm the interaction between HOMER3 or DNCL1 with the C - terminal peptide construct in pairwise tests, but we showed that the C - terminal peptide was important for PAX6 / HOMER3 or PAX6 / DNCL1 interaction because HOMER3 and DNCL1 did not interact with a PST domain construct lacking the C - terminal peptide.

Several proteins are reported to localize to the XY body, including BRCA1, ATR, the histone variant H3. 3, and modified histones such as ubiquitinated H2A ( Ub - H2A) and phosphorylated H2AX ( gamma H2AX) [ 12 - 15].
