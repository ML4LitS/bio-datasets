During the early 1990 ' s, alpha - crystallin was shown to act as a molecular chaperone, binding to partially denatured proteins, both in vitro [ 5] and probably in vivo [ 6], to inhibit further denaturation and aggregation of lens proteins.

The only major difference in the translated amino acid sequence compared to the mammalian and zebrafish enzymes is in the amino terminus of the propeptide region that is shorter by 30 amino acids ( not shown).

Considerable differences are seen, however, at the bottom of the pocket, where the side chains of Asp179 in kumamolisin and the equivalent Ser190 in sedolisin make hydrogen bonds to the P1 tyrosine of the inhibitor ( if present).

The exposure of the phospholipid phosphatidylserine ( PS) in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane of apoptotic cells has been described as one of the hallmarks of the induction of apoptosis and is considered to be one of the most important signals required for apoptotic cell recognition and removal [ 19].

In most cases the receptors on phagocytes that recognize these PS - bridging molecules have not been defined, but it has been reported that GAS - 6 is a ligand for the tyrosine kinase receptor Mer and that MFG - E8 can bind to the vitronectin receptor alpha v beta 3 [ 16, 24].

These mice carry, in addition to a wild - type GluR - B allele, a gene - targeted GluR - Bneo allele in which the intronic sequence critical for GluR - B pre - mRNA editing at the Q / R site is replaced by a floxed TK - neo gene, which severely reduces splicing of the modified intron and hence attenuates the expression of the GluR - Bneo allele [ 60].

Thus, Cre - recombinase removes in forebrain neurons the intronic TK - neo gene, leading to the active GluR - B Delta ECS allele for Q / R site - unedited GluR - B ( Q) subunits ( Figures 1 and S1).

To ascertain if enhanced olfactory learning and odor discrimination may indeed correlate with the increased Ca2 + permeability of AMPA channels in the Q / R site - unedited form, we next analyzed GluR - B Delta FB mice, which lack GluR - B in forebrain.

Furthermore, enhancement in odor discrimination in both GluR - B Delta ECS: FB and GluR - B Delta FB mice makes it likely that improvement in this task results from the common AMPAR property change mediated by the depletion of GluR - B and the lack of the Q / R site - edited GluR - B subunit, both resulting in Ca2 + - permeable AMPARs.

To obtain independent evidence for this spatial and mechanistic dissection of the roles of Ca2 + - permeable AMPARs, we expressed by transgenic means N - terminally green fluorescent protein ( GFP) - tagged GluR - B specifically in hippocampus and piriform cortex of GluR - B Delta FB mice ( Figure 5A and 5B).

A direct contribution to the phenotype by Ca2 + influx through genetically modified AMPA channels seems to be likely, since mice expressing Q / R site - unedited GluR - B showed even better odor learning and discrimination performance compared with mice with depleted GluR - B.

As Ca2 + influx through glutamate receptors is thought to contribute to lateral and recurrent inhibition ( [ 38] see also [ 39]), the absence of GluR - B, or the presence of GluR - B ( Q) in the olfactory bulb, is likely to result in increased inhibition between the principal neurons in this structure.

While we did not address the question whether the SAM domain of mr - s forms a polymeric structure in the present study, the phylogenetic analysis of SAM domain of mr - s and other SAM domain - containing molecules suggests that mr - s can form head - to - tail polymer and mediate gene silencing by spreading repressive complexes along the chromatin similar to ph and / or TEL.
