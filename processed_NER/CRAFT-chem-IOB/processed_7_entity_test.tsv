These structures defined a novel family of enzymes, now called sedolisins or serine - carboxyl peptidases, that is characterized by the utilization of a fully conserved catalytic triad ( Ser, Glu, Asp) and by the presence of an Asp in the oxyanion hole [ 8].

Notably, the normally low Ca2 + permeability of AMPA channels in principal neurons is solely mediated by GluR - B, due to a unique arginine residue ( R587) in the functionally critical glutamine / arginine ( Q / R) site of the pore - forming segment M2 [ 44, 47, 48], resulting from RNA editing of GluR - B pre - mRNA ( [ 49]; reviewed in [ 50]).
