Furthermore, enhancement in odor discrimination in both GluR - B Delta ECS: FB and GluR - B Delta FB mice makes it likely that improvement in this task results from the common AMPAR property change mediated by the depletion of GluR - B and the lack of the Q / R site - edited GluR - B subunit, both resulting in Ca2 + - permeable AMPARs.
