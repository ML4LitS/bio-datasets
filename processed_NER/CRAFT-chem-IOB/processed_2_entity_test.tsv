In the absence of an experimental structure obtained by crystallography or NMR it is sometimes necessary to resort to molecular modeling in order to provide a structural basis for the explanation of the biological properties of an enzyme, and, in particular, to initiate design of its inhibitors.

It is very likely that this represents a fault in the assembled sequence rather than a real variation, since the current coding frame is not initiated with a methionine, and a few extra residues are present in the full genomic sequence available from the fugu sequencing consortium.

That this bond likely occurs in the real protein is suggested by the fact that these two cysteines are strictly conserved in all known animal species of CLN2 ( Figures 1 and 3), although they are absent in all known sequences of bacterial sedolisins.

This part of the pocket, with the main chain of the protein quite distant from the substrate, is indeed not well conserved in these proteins, with kumamolisin missing it entirely due to a deletion in the corresponding sequence position.

Since the catalytic machinery of CLN2 matches closely that of sedolisin, kumamolisin, and other members of the family of serine - carboxyl peptidases, the enzymatic mechanism of all these enzymes is most likely the same.

Occurrence of AT - rich sequences, with asymmetric distribution of adenine and thymine, near the replication origins, lead us to propose that Mcm may play a role in selection of initiation sites of mammalian DNA replication, and prompted us to examine the ability of sequences from human replication origins to activate Mcm4 / 6 / 7 helicase.

The stretches of thymine residues may not be necessarily required, since repeats of TC dinucleotides served as a potent activator for Mcm4 / 6 / 7.

Thus, we have concluded that Mcm4 / 6 / 7 helicase is most efficiently activated by non - structured single - stranded DNA with thymine content of 50% or more, although significant stimulation is observed also by DNA with less thymine content ( Figure 7), suggesting that the sequence specificity for Mcm helicase activation is rather relaxed and that the extent of the activation may depend on the sequence context.

These results indicate either that thymine residues are required on the duplex DNA for continuous unwinding, or that Mcm4 / 6 / 7 is simply not efficient enough to unwind the stable GC pairs.

Replacement of the central guanosine with inosine in the CGG repeat duplex DNA resulted in displacement ( Figure 8E) ( 31), suggesting that the continuous presence of AT base pair may not be essential for the Mcm helicase function and that the thermostability of GC base pairs is inhibitory for helicase action of Mcm4 / 6 / 7.

To confirm these results biochemically, we transfected the same cell lines ( wild - type AQP2 or vector) with F204V - GFP, biotinylated surface proteins after forskolin stimulation, and precipitated the biotinylated proteins ( Figure 5D).

Since only cell surface proteins are accessible to biotin, these results indicate that AQP2 - F204V is transported to the cell surface when wild - type AQP2 is present, but not on its own.

Indeed, restricting the expression of Q / R site - unedited GluR - B to forebrain resulted in almost normal lifespan and an only weakly seizure - prone phenotype [ 58].

In this task, water - deprived mice are trained to distinguish a water - rewarded odor ( S +) and an unrewarded odor ( S -) by their licking response ( Figure 1B).

In the absence of GluR - B, the electrophysiological properties of AMPA channels become similar to those with GluR - B / GluR - B ( Q) switch [ 51] showing strong rectification and increased Ca2 + permeability through AMPA channels ( unpublished data).

If the GluR - B / GluR - B ( Q) switch - induced alterations in the Ca2 + permeability of the AMPA channels are linked to enhanced odor discrimination and learning, the depletion of the GluR - B subunit should lead to a similar phenotypic readout.

Subsequently, protein was extracted from olfactory bulbs, cortical areas, and hippocampi from each mouse, and GluR - B protein was quantified ( Figure 4C).

Whereas no learning or discrimination - related parameter correlated with residual protein levels ( Figure 4D, R2 < 0. 3), a strong correlation between memory and GluR - B protein was observed in hippocampus ( Figure 4D, R2 = 0. 72, p < 0. 003, n = 10) and cortical areas ( Figure 4D, R2 = 0. 62, p < 0. 006, n = 10).

In mice expressing the unedited form of GluR - B ( Q), macroscopic conductance in whole - cell patches of CA1 pyramidals is increased [ 60], but excitatory transmission in CA3 - to - CA1 cell synapses is somewhat reduced, in spite of a lower threshold for generating a population spike [ 58], indicating increased synaptic excitability by sustained GluR - B ( Q) expression, in line with the seizure - prone phenotype.

It will be interesting to see if GluR - B + / neo mice also exhibit enhanced odor discrimination, which is indeed likely given that low levels of GluR - B ( Q), and hence a small increase in Ca2 + - permeable AMPARs, arise from the attenuated GluR - Bneo allele [ 60], and, moreover, that GluR - B levels are decreased in these mice due to the single copy of the GluR - B + allele.

Additionally, by changing the Ca2 + permeability of AMPARs, Ca2 + signaling via AMPA and colocalized NMDA channels might be disturbed, thereby impairing memory formation.

In brief, animals were presented with odor from one out of eight possible odor channels and rewarded with a 2 - to 4 - mu l drop of water in a combined odor / reward port ( Figure 1B), ensuring tight association of the water - reward with a presented odorant.

These data provide strong evidence for two major branches of cellular anti - cadmium defense, one via MTF - 1 and its target genes, notably metallothioneins, the other via glutathione, with an apparent overlap in selenoprotein W.

In addition, it is required for the metalloregulation of Znt1, encoding the major plasma membrane - localized zinc efflux transporter ( 19), the hypoxic / anoxic induction of the gene for placental growth factor ( Plgf), an angiogenic protein of the vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) family ( 20), and has recently been invoked in tumor development ( 21, 22).

In addition, MTF - 1 appears to repress the expression of solute carrier family 39, member 10 gene ( Slc39a10), which encodes a putative metal ion transporter.

100 mm plates with these cells were further transfected by the calcium phosphate method ( 30) with 19. 6 micro g of an expression plasmid for Cre recombinase driven by the CMV promoter and 0. 4 micro g of an expression plasmid for the neomycin resistance gene under the control of the TK promoter.

Ndrg1 probably has some role in stress response since various stimuli, including hypoxia and nickel compounds, activate expression of rodent Ndrg1 and / or its human ortholog ( 37 - 40).

The Ndrg1 microarray results were confirmed with semiquantitative RT - PCRs ( Figure 3a): for Mtf1loxP control livers, a clear increase of Ndrg1 expression was observed after cadmium exposure; in livers from Mtf1Mx - cre mice, this cadmium response was not detectable, while basal expression was similar to controls.

In contrast, no cadmium response was detectable in livers from Mtf1Mx - cre mice, suggesting that MTF - 1 is required for cadmium induction of Csrp1.

Finally, we also identified a number of cadmium - responsive genes that were independent of MTF - 1 presence, by comparing the probe array data of all cadmium - treated mice with the data of all mock - treated mice, irrespective of the genotype ( Table 2).

Consistent with the BrdU and terminal dUTP nick - end labelling ( TUNEL) analyses, E2f1 deletion specifically reversed all these molecular defects, but E2f3 deletion had no effect ( Figure 1H).

As expected, E2f3a - / - retina lacks E2f3a mRNA and still expresses E2f3b mRNA.	"mRNA	44	48	Chemical"	"mRNA	75	79	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""mRNA"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""mRNA"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
E2f3 - / - retina lacks full - length E2f3a and E2f3b mRNAs, and instead expresses a truncated mRNA lacking exon 3.

E2f3a and E2f3b share 110 C - terminal amino acids that encode the NLS, DNA - binding, marked box, transactivation, and Rb - binding domains [ 16], yet they exhibit different subcellular distribution in developing retinal cells.

Rb family and Tfdp proteins can also determine E2f localization [ 20 - 22], and we found that a portion of both Rb and Tfdp1 proteins are cytoplasmic in retinal cells.
