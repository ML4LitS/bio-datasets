Recently the MLIV gene, MCOLN1, has been identified as a new member of the transient receptor potential ( TRP) cation channel superfamily.	"cation	111	117	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""cation"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Also, Mcoln1 maps to chromosome 8 and contains an open reading frame of 580 amino acids, with a transcript length of approximately 2 kb encoded by 14 exons, similar to its human counterpart.	"amino acids	76	87	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""amino acids"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Mcoln1 is highly similar to MCOLN1, especially in the transmembrane domains and ion pore region.	"ion	80	83	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""ion"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Also, the late endosomal / lysosomal targeting signal is conserved, supporting the hypothesis that the protein is localized to these vesicle membranes.	"protein	103	110	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"

Protein trafficking studies suggest that MLIV is the result of a defect in the late endocytic pathway, contrary to the other mucolipidoses which are typically caused by defective lysosomal hydrolases [ 11, 12].

Loss of function mutants of the MCOLN1 C. elegans homologue, cup - 5, result in an increased rate of endocytosis, accumulation of large vacuoles, and a decreased rate of endocytosed protein breakdown; while over - expression of this gene reverses the phenotype [ 13].

In order to clone the mouse homologue of MCOLN1, the human amino acid sequence was compared to the high throughput genomic sequence ( HTGS) database using TBLASTN, which identified the mouse BAC clone RPCI - 23 _ 387H4 ( GB No. AC079544. 1).

The transcript map of the region surrounding Mcoln1 is similar to the corresponding region of the homologous human MCOLN1 region [ 15], and the presence of the zinc finger gene and Nte confirms and extends the region of synteny between human chromosome 19 and mouse chromosome 8.

It is obvious from our results, however, that the identification of this sequence as a full - length protein is incorrect since probes unique to the clone, as well as probes containing the Mcoln1 coding sequence, identify the same transcripts.

This speculation is supported by work with cup - 5 [ 13], the c. elegans homologue of MCOLN1, since cellular localization studies suggest that the protein is found in the late endosomes and / or lysosomes.

We identify a 216 kb deletion in deH that removes all but the first exon of the Tbx15 gene, whose embryonic expression in developing mesenchyme correlates with pigmentary and skeletal malformations observed in deH / deH animals.

Among vertebrates, differences in the shape or number of skeletal elements, altered morphology of epidermal appendages, and variation in pigment distribution combine to produce the majority of what distinguishes one animal from another.	"pigment	137	144	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""pigment"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Among these, pigment patterns are an excellent system to investigate how morphological differences arise, both for different regions of the body within a species and for different animals from closely related species.	"pigment	13	20	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""pigment"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
In natural environments, color variation is a nearly universal mechanism for recognition, camouflage, or both; consequently, a large number of pigment patterns have been characterized from an evolutionary and ecological perspective ( Boughman 2001; Jiggins et al. 2001).	"pigment	143	150	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""pigment"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
In the laboratory, color variation has been the subject of vertebrate genetics for more than a century ( Searle 1968; Silvers 1979), and many pigmentary components have been identified whose actions are understood in a cellular or organ - based context ( reviewed in Bennett and Lamoreux 2003).	"pigmentary	142	152	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""pigmentary"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
In the embryo, alterations in the determination or migration of melanoblasts from the neural crest affect the number or distribution of pigment cells in the skin ( reviewed in Reedy et al. 1998).	"pigment	136	143	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""pigment"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Within hair follicles, paracrine signals control the type of pigment made in specific regions of the body or at specific times during the hair cycle ( reviewed in Furumura et al. 1996; Barsh et al. 2000).	"pigment	61	68	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""pigment"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Finally, movement of pigment granules within melanocytes or from melanocytes to keratinocytes makes use of cellular machinery that is shared by a variety of cell types, but that can vary in different regions of the body ( reviewed in Marks and Seabra 2001).	"pigment	21	28	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""pigment"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
In rodents and probably other mammals, this dorsoventral difference in hair color is brought about by differences in pigment type as determined by allelic variation of the Agouti gene ( Bultman et al. 1992; Miller et al. 1993).	"pigment	117	124	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""pigment"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Agouti protein has a short radius of action ( Silvers and Russel 1955) and can be switched on and off during a single hair cycle ( Bultman et al. 1992, 1994; Miller et al. 1993; Vrieling et al. 1994); thus, its regulated expression is thought to be responsible for the cream - colored or yellow ventral surface of mice carrying the black - and - tan ( at) allele and for the yellow markings around the feet, ears, or head, i. e., tan points or head spots, of certain dog breeds.	"protein	7	14	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 7, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
In laboratory mice, previous studies from our group and others identified two predominant Agouti mRNA isoforms that differ by virtue of their transcriptional initiation site and 5 ' untranslated exons.	"mRNA	97	101	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""mRNA"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Ventral - specific Agouti isoforms are also expressed in developing skin from embryonic day 10. 5 ( E10. 5) and beyond and may play a role in pigment cell differentiation ( Millar et al. 1995).	"pigment	142	149	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""pigment"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
The boundary between dorsal and ventral color compartments in at / at mice bears superficial resemblance to dorsoventral boundaries apparent for many other mammals, but morphogenetic differences between dorsal and ventral skin seem likely to include more elements than the type of pigment made by hair follicle melanocytes.	"pigment	281	288	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""pigment"", ""start_span"": 281, ""end_span"": 288, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Our results indicate that the apparent uniformity of the dorsoventral boundary represents the sum of independent mechanisms that affect melanocyte density and / or differentiation, pigment - type synthesis, and hair length; surprisingly, none of these coincide with the somite - lateral plate lineage boundary.	"pigment	181	188	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""pigment"", ""start_span"": 181, ""end_span"": 188, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Semiquantitative measurements of hair length plotted as a function of dorsoventral position reveal that the apparent sharp boundary between dorsal and ventral pigment compartments in at / at mice coincides with a more gradual change in both hair color and hair length ( Figure 1A - 1D).	"pigment	159	166	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""pigment"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 166, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Taken together, these observations indicate that variation of hair length along the dorsoventral axis is stereotyped and maintained through multiple hair cycles, with a transition in hair length that is gradual and encompasses the pigment - type transition in at / at mice.	"pigment	231	238	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""pigment"", ""start_span"": 231, ""end_span"": 238, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Using DOPA staining as an indicator of tyrosinase activity, we observed a gradual dorsoventral transition in isolated dermis preparations from P4. 5 ae / ae mice ( Figure 1G).	"DOPA	6	10	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""DOPA"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Regardless, dorsoventral differences in hair pigment content of ae / ae mice persist throughout multiple hair cycles into adulthood, similar to hair length ( but unlike skin thickness).

"We became interested in droopy ear because the original allele was described to affect pigment pattern in a way that suggests a possible dorsal to ventral transformation: "" On a genetic background ( at and AW) which causes the belly hair to be lighter than the back hair, the belly hair comes up farther round the sides of the body and face "" ( Curry 1959)."	"pigment	87	94	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""pigment"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
An abnormal dorsoventral pigment pattern is readily apparent in at / at; deH / deH mice, but comparison to nonmutant animals is more accurately described in terms of ventral, lateral, and dorsal regions ( Figures 1G and 2A).	"pigment	25	32	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""pigment"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
The lateral region contains yellow hairs of progressively increasing length; in at / at mice, the lateral region appears as a thin yellow stripe along the flank, but in at / at; deH / deH mice, the lateral region is considerably expanded with a diffuse boundary along the dorsal flank, and a dorsal eumelanic region whose size is correspondingly reduced ( Figure 2A and 2B).	"eumelanic	299	308	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""eumelanic"", ""start_span"": 299, ""end_span"": 308, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
To investigate whether deH affects other dorsoventral skin characteristics besides pigment - type switching, we examined its effects on hair length and pigmentation in an ae / ae background.	"pigment	83	90	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""pigment"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
At this stage, melanoblast migration from the neural crest is mostly complete, but there is a dorsoventral gradient in melanocyte differentiation and pigment synthesis.	"pigment	150	157	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""pigment"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
The skin of ae / ae neonates appears uniformly dark over the entire dorsum, but in ae / ae; deH / deH neonates, the area of dark skin is more restricted, particularly above the limbs, and resembles the pattern of dorsal eumelanin in at / at; deH / deH adult animals.	"eumelanin	220	229	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""eumelanin"", ""start_span"": 220, ""end_span"": 229, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
By comparing the sequence of a 1. 3 kb junction fragment amplified from deH / deH genomic DNA to publicly available mouse genome sequence, we identified a 216 kb deletion that extends from Tbx15 intron 1 to 148 kb downstream of the polyadenylation sequence in a region annotated as a mannose - 6 - phosphate receptor pseudogene, M6pr - ps ( Figure 3B and 3C).	"mannose - 6 - phosphate	284	307	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""mannose - 6 - phosphate"", ""start_span"": 284, ""end_span"": 307, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
However, the deletion removes 534 of the 602 amino acids encoded by Tbx15 ( including the T - box DNA - binding domain), deH / + animals are grossly normal, and the phenotype of deH / deH animals is identical to that described for the original allele.	"amino acids	45	56	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""amino acids"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
These observations demonstrate that the pigmentary and craniofacial characteristics of deH are caused by loss of function for Tbx15.	"pigmentary	40	50	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""pigmentary"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
To investigate this pattern in more detail, we hybridized a Tbx15 mRNA probe to a series of transverse sections at E12. 5 and observed expression in multiple mesenchymal tissues of the head, trunk, and developing limbs ( Figure 4A), much of which is consistent with the skull, cervical vertebrae, and limb malformations reported for mice carrying the original droopy ear allele.

Although the effects of Agouti on pigment - type switching occur during postnatal hair growth, the ventral - specific isoform of Agouti is expressed in developing skin beginning at E11. 5.	"pigment	34	41	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""pigment"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
The observations described above are consistent with a model in which transient expression of Tbx15 in the embryonic dorsal flank is required to establish positional identity of the future dermis, at least with respect to pigment - type synthesis caused by the ventral - specific Agouti isoform.

However, in parallel preparations from at / at mice, the ventral pheomelanin domain represents 47% of the total skin circumference; therefore, the proportions of total skin circumference occupied by dorsal eumelanin and somite - derived dermis are 53% and 37%, respectively ( Figure 8B).	"eumelanin	206	215	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""eumelanin"", ""start_span"": 206, ""end_span"": 215, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Ventral areas that normally produce yellow hair in the trunk, limbs, and craniofacial regions are expanded in deH / deH mice and, in the trunk at least, represent inappropriate dorsal expression of an Agouti mRNA isoform that is normally restricted to ventral skin.	"mRNA	208	212	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""mRNA"", ""start_span"": 208, ""end_span"": 212, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Our results suggest that patterned expression of Tbx15 provides an instructional cue required to establish the future identity of dorsal dermis with regard to pigmentary and hair length patterning.	"pigmentary	159	169	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""pigmentary"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 169, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
However, Agouti mRNA in both embryonic and postnatal skin is distributed along a gradient whose dorsal boundary is indistinct and overlaps with two additional gradients recognized by their effects on hair length and histochemical staining for melanocytes.	"mRNA	16	20	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""mRNA"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Loss of Tbx15 affects dorsoventral transitions of hair length, pigment content, and expression of the ventral - specific Agouti isoform; however, the former two effects are subtle and contribute little, if at all, to the abnormal pigmentation of adult deH / deH mice.	"pigment	63	70	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""pigment"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Our attention to the role of Tbx15 in pigment patterning was motivated by the effects of Agouti in postnatal animals.	"pigment	38	45	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""pigment"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
However, neither normal patterns of pigment - type synthesis in the limb nor their disruption in deH / deH mice correspond to obvious developmental compartments.	"pigment	36	43	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""pigment"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
We speculate that a diffusible signal from dorsal trunk ectoderm, at or prior to E11. 5, promotes expression of Tbx15 in dorsal trunk mesenchyme, which then establishes dorsal positional identity of those cells as manifested by differences in Agouti expression, pigment - cell development, and hair growth.	"pigment	262	269	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""pigment"", ""start_span"": 262, ""end_span"": 269, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Thus, there exist at least three distinct boundaries in postnatal mammalian skin that are parallel to the sagittal plane, marked by differences in pigment - type synthesis, differences in cell lineage, and differences in expression of Msx1.

Smith - Lemli - Opitz syndrome ( SLOS, MIM 270400), a relative common dysmorphology disorder, is caused by mutations in DHCR7 [ 2 - 5], which encodes for 7 - dehydrocholesterol Delta 7 - reductase and catalyzes a final step of cholesterol biosynthesis.

Although a mechanistic understanding of why a deficiency in cholesterol biosynthesis leads to abnormal embryonic development is lacking, a frequently advanced explanation has been that Shh signaling, involved in early developmental patterning, may be disrupted.

However, we favor a model whereby the loss of normal cholesterol biosynthesis is important, not so much for Shh autocleavage, as for the loss of the correct plasma membrane milieu.

Reinforcement - mediated associative learning, or the ability to ascribe deterministic relationships between environmental stimuli that signal the probability of receiving a primary reinforcer ( e. g. food), has been divided into 3 components or stages [ 1].	"food	201	205	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""food"", ""start_span"": 201, ""end_span"": 205, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
The first, unlearned stage is the organism ' s experience with a primary reinforcer that elicits some unlearned / innate physiological response ( e. g. palatability of a food or satiety).	"food	170	174	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""food"", ""start_span"": 170, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
The second phase involves the attachment of salience to external stimuli ( discriminative stimuli) that signal whether the delivery of a primary reinforcer will or will not occur based on some emitted behavior ( e. g. a rodent lever presses for food pellets only when a stimulus light is illuminated in an operant chamber).	"food	245	249	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""food"", ""start_span"": 245, ""end_span"": 249, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Finally, there is the maintenance of associative learning relationships over time ( a stimulus light always signifies a food pellet is available subsequent to a lever press) [ see refs. [ 1, 2] for review].	"food	120	124	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""food"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
"Berridge and Robinson [ 1] have proposed that dopamine plays a pivotal role in the second phase of reinforcement - mediated associative learning by molding the "" incentive salience "" or learned motivational properties of conditioned stimuli."

Dopamine signaling is mediated at the cellular level by two major subclasses of G - protein coupled receptors that are referred to as D - 1 like ( D1aR, D1b / 5R) or D - 2 like ( D2R, D3R, D4R) [ 12, 13].	"Dopamine	0	8	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Dopamine"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Although individual genes code for each dopamine receptor subtype, there is considerable pharmacological overlap between D1 - like and D2 - like receptors.	"dopamine	40	48	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""dopamine"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Several studies have used pharmacological manipulations to investigate the contribution of dopamine receptor subtypes in various stages of associative learning [ 1, 2, 14].	"dopamine	91	99	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""dopamine"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Besides their lack of receptor subtype specificity, an acute exposure to commercially available D2 receptor antagonists fails to completely block signaling mediated solely by D2Rs.	"antagonists	108	119	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""antagonists"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Moreover, acute dosing does not recapitulate the marked learning deficits produced in rodents [ 15, 16] by chronic exposure to dopamine D2R antagonists [ 6, 7].

To master the odor - driven stimulus discrimination task, D2R - / - mice required significantly more trials ( Fig. 3A: t ( 14) = 2. 20; p < 0. 05) and committed more errors ( Fig. 3B: t ( 14) = 2. 92; p < 0. 05) than D2R + / + mice to learn to associate a specific odor with the presence or absence of the food reinforcer.

These findings are in complete agreement with earlier studies that utilized rats and fairly selective D2R antagonists [ 3 - 8], as well as even very extensive 6 - OHDA lesions [ 1, 10, 11] in associative and operant learning paradigms.	"antagonists	106	117	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""antagonists"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Several studies have demonstrated that both the acquisition [ 6, 7] and expression [ 9] of associative learning are mediated by dopamine D1Rs.	"dopamine	128	136	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""dopamine"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
However, only acute administrations of antagonists were given, and learning was not measured during complete D1R or D2R blockade [ 6].	"antagonists	39	50	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""antagonists"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Significantly, the reports cited above failed to address the technical limitations of the approach: i. e. that the antagonists used lack adequate subtype specificity and only partially blocked D2R - mediated signaling thus making it impossible to rigorously assess the role of D2R - mediated signaling in associative and reversal learning.	"antagonists	115	126	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""antagonists"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Additionally, none of these studies addressed the observation that the effects of D2R antagonists on locomotion and learning depend on whether exposure is chronic or acute [ e. g. [ 15, 16]].	"antagonists	86	97	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""antagonists"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
"One might then ask: "" How then could the role of D2Rs in associative learning be dissociated from motor behavior? "" Seminal experiments [ 26 - 28] have clearly demonstrated that repeated administration of catalepsy - inducing doses of D2R antagonists in rodents actually leads to a striking behavioral tolerance to catalepsy."

Future experiments measuring acquisition of associative learning in rodents that received chronic administration of D2R antagonists and demonstrated behavioral tolerance to their motor disrupting effects would be a logical test of this hypothesis.

While they do have their limitations ( e. g. developmental compensation and strain effects in mouse lines not backcrossed adequately to a parental strain for a minimum of 10 generations), use of our inbred ( N20 generation) animals in the present study ( where no differences in locomotor behavior were detected between D2R - / - and D2R + / + mice; Figs. 1 & 2) revealed a previously unappreciated role of D2R - mediated signaling in associative learning and attention that could not be measured with the currently available, acutely administered D2R antagonists.	"antagonists	552	563	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""antagonists"", ""start_span"": 552, ""end_span"": 563, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Rather, we argue that this is not likely because the D2R - / - mice did learn to retrieve the food pellets from the dishes and eventually learned to accurately discriminate odors.	"food	94	98	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""food"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Consequently, our data, and data from other studies, suggest that the complete lack of D2Rs in the olfactory bulb does not prevent transduction of olfactory stimuli; rather it affects the ability to habituate, or tune, olfactory nerve activity associated with repeatedly encountered concentrations of chemical stimuli [ 32].

To investigate whether the reduced size of the Atrxnull embryos was due to an increase in apoptosis, we analysed sections of paraffin - embedded 7. 5 dpc embryos by TdT - mediated dUTP nick end labeling ( TUNEL) assay ( Figure 6A).

Since this small apoptotic response is unlikely to account fully for the dramatic size deficit observed in Atrxnull embryos, a possible proliferation defect was also investigated by immunohistochemical staining of 7. 5 dpc embryo sections for the mitosis marker phosphorylated ( Ser10) histone H3 [ 13].

Thus, in the extraembryonic compartment of AtrxWT / null carrier females, normal imprinted X - inactivation would be expected to result in silencing of the paternally derived AtrxWT allele, leaving only the Atrxnull allele on the active maternal X ( Xm) and thereby render the extraembryonic tissues null for full - length Atrx protein.

It is possible that disruption of the mouse Atrx - Daxx complex ( by ablation of the Atrx protein) could have triggered a universal proapoptotic response.	"protein	90	97	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
An alternative explanation for the unexpectedly severe phenotype we observed in mice is that the Atrx Delta 18 Delta neo deletion generated by Cre recombination completely ablates full - length Atrx protein ( Figure 2E).

Some full - length ATRX protein is detected in cases predicted to have truncating mutations ( RJG, unpublished data), and residual ATPase activity in ATRX immunoprecipitates can be detected in Epstein - Barr virus - transformed lymphocytes of all human patients analysed to date ( A.

The failure to observe a truly null ATRX allele among human patients strongly suggests that, as in the mouse, the complete absence of ATRX protein is incompatible with human fetal survival.

Thus, the failure to correctly silence the paternally derived AtrxWT allele in the extraembryonic tissues of carrier females is consistent with our observations that in Atrxnull males, the Atrx protein plays an essential role in the development of the trophoblast and is necessary for survival in utero in the mouse.
