Since the few inhibitors that have been successfully used in the studies of sedolisins are either longer than tripeptides or contain blocking groups on their N termini, new tripeptide - based inhibitors with free N termini are now being synthesized ( Oda, unpublished).

In these distinct synapses, lateral and recurrent inhibition mediated by the gamma - aminobutyric acid - A system may be controlled by the activity of the closely appositioned glutamatergic part, perhaps triggering increased gamma - aminobutyric acid release by Ca2 + influx through glutamate - gated receptor channels ( [ 38]; see also [ 39]).

Evidence suggests that the production of reactive oxygen species is a major effect of acute cadmium toxicity ( 68, 69), and exposure of cultured cells or animals to cadmium is associated with depletion of reduced glutathione, lipid peroxidation and DNA damage ( 70 - 73).
