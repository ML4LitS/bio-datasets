Indeed, the relative contribution of increased triglyceride synthesis rates to the steatotic phenotype cannot be fully discerned from our data, given that this response could reflect the direct effects of PGC - 1 alpha deficiency on target genes or a secondary compensatory response to hepatocyte fatty acid accumulation.	triglyceride,47,59,Chemical	fatty acid,297,307,Chemical	"[{""token"": ""triglyceride"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""fatty acid"", ""start_span"": 297, ""end_span"": 307, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"	train

Moreover, the ablation of GluR - B, but also changes in the extent of Q / R site editing of GluR - B, can alter the strength of excitatory synaptic transmission in the genetically addressed neuronal populations [ 51, 58, 60], thus potentially shifting the balance of excitatory and inhibitory transmission in the affected circuits.
