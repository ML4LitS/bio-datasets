Numerous studies have correlated a down - regulation of E - cadherin with a translocation of beta - catenin to the nucleus and a transactivation of genes that are regulated by the LEF - 1 / T cell factor ( TCF) family of DNA binding proteins [ 23, 24, 25].	proteins,233,241,Chemical	"[{""token"": ""proteins"", ""start_span"": 233, ""end_span"": 241, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"	train

Moreover, the stimulatory effects appeared to be specific to TGF - beta 2, since they were abrogated either by heat inactivation of the TGF - beta 2 protein or by mutation of a putative SMAD binding element located about 1. 8 kb 5 ' from the Snail transcription start site ( Figure 5D).	protein,149,156,Chemical	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 149, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"	train

For example, the unfolding and chaperone activity of components of the 19S cap of the proteasome may be modulated by the CLD of RanBP2 [ 14] and contribute to the selective HKI ( and other substrates) degradation [ 43], while association of nuclear import receptor, importin - beta with the Ran - binding domains of RanBP2 [ 10, 11], may mediate the nuclear translocation of multifunctional substrates, such as glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase.	glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate,411,441,Chemical	"[{""token"": ""glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate"", ""start_span"": 411, ""end_span"": 441, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"	train

Thus, to examine whether the pronounced variability of olfactory memory in GluR - B Delta FB mice ( Figure 2E) reflects variability of GluR - B levels in GluR - B Delta FB mice, we analyzed the residual amount of GluR - B protein in mice with disparate memory performances ( Figure 4A - C).	protein,222,229,Chemical	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 222, ""end_span"": 229, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"	test
Notably, mice with pronounced memory deficits ( memory < 70%) showed essentially no detectable GluR - B protein in hippocampus, amygdala, olfactory bulb, and piriform cortex ( n = 2, Figure 4B, and unpublished data), but mice with almost complete memory displayed substantial residual GluR - B levels in all brain areas investigated ( n = 2, Figure 4B, and unpublished data).	protein,104,111,Chemical	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"	test
To quantify the relation between residual GluR - B protein and olfactory memory, the memory experiment was repeated with nine additional GluR - B Delta FB mice and two GluR - B2lox control animals ( indicated with shaded symbols in Figure 4A), resulting in the same mean, variability, and range of memory performance ( control: 89 +/- 10%; GluR - B Delta FB: 63 +/- 14%).	protein,51,58,Chemical	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"	test

In the olfactory memory experiments with GluR - B Delta FB animals, olfactory memory linearly depended on GluR - B expression in cortex and hippocampus with a slope of 9. 1 +/- 2. 5% ( cortex) and 8. 9 +/- 2. 0% ( hippocampus) increase in memory per 10% increase in protein ( Figure 4D).	protein,266,273,Chemical	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 266, ""end_span"": 273, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"	test

However, odor discrimination ( measured by the discrimination index as in Figures 1, 2, and 4D) was as enhanced as in GluR - B Delta FB mice ( 0. 79 +/- 0. 05, mean +/- SEM compared with 0. 76 +/- 0. 02, p > 0. 7, Figure 6C), and improved relative to GluR - B2lox controls ( 0. 48 +/- 0. 06; Figure 6C; overall ANOVA: F ( 2, 41) = 17. 2, p < 10 - 5; post hoc Newman Keuls: p < 10 - 3), as expected if the enhanced discrimination phenotype is due to Ca2 + - permeable AMPARs in the olfactory bulb and unaffected by GluR - B expression in piriform cortex or hippocampus.

This variability could be traced to epigenetic variability in the transgenic expression of Cre - recombinase, which mediated recombination within loxP - flanked segments of gene - targeted alleles for the dominant AMPAR subunit GluR - B, and hence operated the switch in AMPAR properties toward GluR - B ablation and increased Ca2 + permeability.

In a nutshell, we conclude that olfactory discrimination is enhanced by an increase in AMPAR - mediated Ca2 + permeability within the olfactory bulb, whereas olfactory memory becomes impaired upon genetically induced GluR - B ablation in higher brain centers, specifically in piriform cortex.
