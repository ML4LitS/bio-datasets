Four days later, embryos in diapause were flushed out of the uterus and cultured on STO feeder cells in four - well plates in Dulbecco ' s Modified Eagle Medium ( DMEM) supplemented with 20% Fetal Bovine Serum ( Hyclone), 0. 1 mM Non - Essential Amino Acids ( Invitrogen), 2 mM L - glutamine ( Invitrogen), 50 U / ml Penicillin - Streptomysin ( Invitrogen), and 0. 11 mM 2 - mercaptoethanol ( Invitrogen).
