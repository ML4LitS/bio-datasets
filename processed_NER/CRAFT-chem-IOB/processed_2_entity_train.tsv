We hypothesized that disruption of only one of the half - transporters would result in sitosterolemia and selective loss of either sterolin may show a differential effect on the biliary secretion of sterols or intestinal absorption of sterols.

Plasma campesterol and sitosterol levels were eight - and 36 - fold higher in Abcg8 - / - mice compared to wild - type mice ( 8. 76 +/- 2. 10 and 18. 52 +/- 5. 03 mg / dL, respectively, versus 1. 14 +/- 0. 69 and 0. 50 +/- 0. 55 mg / dL).

No significant differences in brain sterol contents were observed, as would be expected, since the blood brain barrier is intact and prevents entry of these sterols in sitosterolemia ( Table 2).

However, there is little if any esterification of sitosterol or campesterol ( Figure 2b, 2c) consistent with previous findings [ 37, 38].

Expression of HMG - CoA reductase mRNA was decreased by ~ 50% and ~ 80% in the heterozygote and knockout mice respectively, in keeping with limited observations in human patients with this disorder [ 7].

To verify whether the mRNA changes resulted in alteration of the enzyme activity changes, liver samples were analyzed for HMG - CoA reductase activity and Cyp7a1 activity ( Figure 4b).

HMG - CoA reductase activity was reduced by 30% and 60% in the Abcg8 + / - and Abcg8 - / - mice, respectively ( Figure 4b), and thus reflected the changes in mRNA expression.

As has been previously published, Abcg5 / sterolin - 1 exists in two separate forms, the ' immature ' 75 kDa protein and a fully glycosylated ' mature ' 93 kDa protein [ 18, 30].

Sitosterolemic individuals have an impaired ability to secrete cholesterol and plant sterols into bile [ 40, 41].

To investigate whether the defect in biliary sterol secretion could be ( partly) restored by forced biliary sterol secretion, we infused mice with stepwise increasing doses of tauroursodeoxycholic acid ( TUDC).	"sterol	45	51	Chemical"	"sterol	108	114	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""sterol"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""sterol"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
In the heterozygous mice, sterol secretion increased to reach a maximal level of about 50% of the wild type suggesting that Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 is a rate - limiting step for biliary ' cholesterol ' secretion.	"sterol	26	32	Chemical"	"cholesterol	185	196	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""sterol"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""cholesterol"", ""start_span"": 185, ""end_span"": 196, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Since the Abcg8 - / - mice still secreted some sterols we were interested in which biliary sterol species were being secreted.	"sterols	47	54	Chemical"	"sterol	91	97	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""sterols"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""sterol"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Additionally, the activity of the rate - limiting enzyme for bile acid synthesis, CYP7a1, is reduced, although no changes at the mRNA level are noted.	"bile acid	61	70	Chemical"	"mRNA	129	133	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""bile acid"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""mRNA"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
This is also in keeping with previous studies that show that sitosterol is a direct inhibitor of this enzyme in vitro [ 39].	"sitosterol	61	71	Chemical"	"inhibitor of this enzyme	84	108	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""sitosterol"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""inhibitor of this enzyme"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Furthermore, complete loss of Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 results in an inability to secrete cholesterol into bile, although secretion of sitosterol seemed to be preserved.	"cholesterol	86	97	Chemical"	"sitosterol	131	141	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""cholesterol"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""sitosterol"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Arguably, since the body pools and plasma sitosterol levels in the knockout mice are so considerably elevated, perhaps the biliary sitosterol levels could be considered to be inappropriately low.	"sitosterol	42	52	Chemical"	"sitosterol	131	141	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""sitosterol"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""sitosterol"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Despite this reservation, the finding that sitosterol is present in the bile suggests that plant sterols may be secreted independent of Abcg8 / sterolin - 2.	"sitosterol	43	53	Chemical"	"plant sterols	91	104	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""sitosterol"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""plant sterols"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
The ability of Abcg8 - / - mice to secrete bile salt and phospholipid into bile as compared to wild - type mice was not significantly impaired.

Plasma and hepatic plant sterol levels in Abcg8 - / - and Abcg5 / Abcg8 knockout are increased similarly with marked decreases in cholesterol levels.	"plant sterol	19	31	Chemical"	"cholesterol	130	141	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""plant sterol"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""cholesterol"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
In preliminary studies, when knockout mice are placed on a low sitosterol diet, the activity of this enzyme, as well as the mRNA levels are increased ( E Klett and S Patel, unpublished observations).	"sitosterol	63	73	Chemical"	"mRNA	124	128	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""sitosterol"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""mRNA"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 deficient mice also allow us to examine the role of this protein in biliary sterol secretion.	"protein	78	85	Chemical"	"sterol	97	103	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""sterol"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
The bile is sterol poor and upon stimulation by increasing bile salt excretion, Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 deficient mice cannot respond, in contrast to the wild - type mice.	"sterol	12	18	Chemical"	"bile salt	59	68	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""sterol"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""bile salt"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Thus, Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 is necessary for cholesterol secretion but not necessary for plant sterol secretion.	"cholesterol	44	55	Chemical"	"plant sterol	88	100	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""cholesterol"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""plant sterol"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
It could be argued that although the biliary sterol output is comparable to that seen in wild - type mice that this is inappropriately low, since the tissue and plasma pools of sitosterol are so elevated in the knockout mice.	"sterol	45	51	Chemical"	"sitosterol	177	187	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""sterol"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""sitosterol"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 187, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Despite this caveat, the findings of sitosterol in significant quantities in the bile suggests that mechanisms other than via the sterolins can ' export ' some of these sterols.	"sitosterol	37	47	Chemical"	"sterols	169	176	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""sitosterol"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""sterols"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
While the rate of total biliary sterol secretion is reduced compared to wild - type mice, since the heterozygous mice are not sitosterolemic, either the activity of these proteins is not rate limiting or other mechanisms can compensate for a 50% loss of activity.	"sterol	32	38	Chemical"	"proteins	171	179	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""sterol"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""proteins"", ""start_span"": 171, ""end_span"": 179, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
This may be amenable to testing by placing these animals on a high plant sterol diet and measuring the plasma sterol levels.

Recently, Kosters et al. reported that Abcg5 / Abcg8 mRNA expression in a variety of different mouse strains correlated with biliary cholesterol secretion rates [ 30].

In their studies, although diosgenin - fed mice showed a marked increase in biliary cholesterol output, mRNA levels of Abcg5 and Abcg8 were not altered.

In a genetic screen of plasma plant sterol levels, Sehayek et al. identified three loci that may be responsible for controlling plasma plant sterol levels and not one of these loci mapped to the murine STSL region [ 43].	"plant sterol	30	42	Chemical"	"plant sterol	135	147	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""plant sterol"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""plant sterol"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 147, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Taken together, these animal models suggest that Abcg5 / sterolin - 1 and Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 have independent function in vivo or that there are proteins other than the sterolins that can secrete biliary sterols.	"proteins	147	155	Chemical"	"sterols	206	213	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""proteins"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 155, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""sterols"", ""start_span"": 206, ""end_span"": 213, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
These data strongly support the direct role of Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 as a key player in biliary cholesterol secretion, although biliary sitosterol secretion was apparently preserved.

Taken together, these latter results indicate a cell - autonomous defect in PGC - 1 alpha - / - hepatocytes that results in an inability to maintain cellular lipid balance in the context of increased delivery of lipid such as occurs with fasting.

Given that older female PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice develop an increase in body fat stores, glucose tolerance and insulin responsiveness were further evaluated in this group.

To examine glucose homeostasis in response to high - fat diet, female PGC - 1 alpha + / + and PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice were placed on high - fat chow ( 43% calories from fat) for 6 wk starting at 8 wk of age.

Surprisingly, the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice on a high - fat diet were significantly more glucose - tolerant and insulin - sensitive compared to the PGC - 1 alpha + / + mice ( Figure 9B).

Microvacuolation of the neuropil and neurons of the PGC - 1 alpha - / - basal ganglia ( caudate and putamen) was also noted in association with a patchy increase in the number and intensity of glial fibrillary acidic protein - immunoreactive astrocytic processes ( unpublished data).

Previous studies using gain - of - function strategies have shown that the coactivator PGC - 1 alpha is capable of coactivating an array of transcription factors involved in energy metabolic processes including fatty acid oxidation, electron transport, and oxidative phosphorylation [ 6].

Studies with a beta 3 - adrenergic agonist confirmed that the peak oxygen consumption rate in thermogenic tissue is diminished in PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice.

Further analysis revealed that palmitate oxidation rates were reduced in hepatocytes isolated from the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice, which would predispose to lipid accumulation.

Surprisingly, the reduction in fatty acid oxidation rates in PGC - 1 alpha null hepatocytes was not due to altered expression of PGC - 1 alpha / PPAR target genes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation.	"fatty acid	31	41	Chemical"	"fatty acid	189	199	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""fatty acid"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""fatty acid"", ""start_span"": 189, ""end_span"": 199, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
In addition, we found that triglyceride synthesis was abnormally activated, and the expression of genes encoding SREBP - 1c and SCD - 1, key proteins in the hepatic lipogenic pathway, failed to be appropriately down - regulated in fasted PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice.	"triglyceride	27	39	Chemical"	"proteins	141	149	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""triglyceride"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""proteins"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Indeed, the relative contribution of increased triglyceride synthesis rates to the steatotic phenotype cannot be fully discerned from our data, given that this response could reflect the direct effects of PGC - 1 alpha deficiency on target genes or a secondary compensatory response to hepatocyte fatty acid accumulation.	"triglyceride	47	59	Chemical"	"fatty acid	297	307	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""triglyceride"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""fatty acid"", ""start_span"": 297, ""end_span"": 307, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
We conclude that reduced hepatocyte mitochondrial respiratory capacity, and possibly activation of lipogenic programs, result in hepatocyte triglyceride accumulation in the context of increased hepatic delivery of fatty acids such as occurs with fasting.

Moreover, female PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice were more glucose - tolerant and insulin - sensitive than PGC - 1 alpha + / + controls when consuming a high - fat diet.

However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the sensitivity of the immunoblotting was not high enough to pick up a small amount of mutant ( truncated) PGC - 1 alpha protein that could have some activity, given that it would contain nuclear receptor - interacting domains and the amino - terminal activation domain.
