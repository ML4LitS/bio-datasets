In the single alpha - crystallin knockout mice, the remaining alpha - crystallin may fully or partially compensate for some of the functions of the missing protein, especially in the lens, where both alphaA and alphaB are normally expressed at high levels.

Alpha - Crystallin is comprised of two polypeptides, alphaA - crystallin ( alphaA) and alphaB - crystallin ( alphaB), which share 55% amino acid sequence homology [ 1].	"amino acid	134	144	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""amino acid"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
They are the most abundant proteins in lens fiber cells [ 2, 3] and exist as heteroaggregates of approximately 800 kDa that can undergo inter - aggregate subunit exchange [ 4].	"proteins	27	35	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""proteins"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
The expression of these two proteins in the lens epithelium, however, is not uniform throughout different regions of the anterior epithelium.	"proteins	28	36	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""proteins"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Prior to the 1990 ' s, alpha - crystallin was thought to be a structural protein whose major cellular function was to produce a dense solution necessary for the refraction of light in the lens.	"protein	73	80	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Collectively, these findings have challenged the dogma that alpha - crystallin is purely a structural protein necessary for light refraction, and have led to the realization that alpha - crystallin may have a variety of biological functions in the lens.

In addition, the administration of exogenous alpha - crystallin to primary bovine lens epithelial cell cultures resulted in the formation of lentoid bodies, consistent with a role for these proteins in lens differentiation [ 21].

The objectives of the current report were to characterize gross morphology of young ( 5 wk) and old ( 54 wk) mouse lenses with targeted disruption of both the alphaA and alphaB genes, in comparison to age matched wild type lenses, using scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) and confocal microscopy, to elucidate the possible functions of alpha - crystallin in the lens.

In 5 wk, 46 wk or 72 wk old wild type lenses ( Figure 2C, 2D and 2E), however, there was no posterior or anterior subcapsular nucleic acid staining and the embryonic - fetal nucleus was centrally located, not in contact with the posterior capsule.

In 5 wk alphaA / BKO lenses there was a high density of stained membranes per unit area throughout the cortex, with no nucleic acid staining in these regions.	"nucleic acid	119	131	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""nucleic acid"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"

In the single alpha - crystallin knockout mice, the remaining alpha - crystallin may fully or partially compensate for some of the functions of the missing protein, especially in the lens, where both alphaA and alphaB are normally expressed at high levels.	"protein	156	163	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 156, ""end_span"": 163, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
This was supported by the morphological observation made in this study of no posterior sutures or fiber cells extending to the posterior capsule of the lens, ectopically staining nucleic acids in the posterior subcapsular region of 5 wk and anterior subcapsular cortex of 54 wk, gross morphological differences in the equatorial / bow, posterior and anterior regions of lenses from alphaA / BKO mice as compared to wild mice.	"nucleic acids	179	192	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""nucleic acids"", ""start_span"": 179, ""end_span"": 192, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
It must be noted, however, that the alphaA / BKO mice also lack the HSPB2 gene product [ 23] and the contribution of this protein to normal lens morphology and functions should not be overlooked.	"protein	122	129	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
It is unlikely that these alterations in alphaA / BKO mouse lenses result from increased susceptibility of these lenses to light - induced damage in the absence of the molecular chaperone protection afforded by alphaA and alphaB in normal lenses.	"molecular	168	177	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""molecular"", ""start_span"": 168, ""end_span"": 177, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
These changes included posterior subcapsular nucleic acid staining, absence of posterior sutures, and small irregularly shaped cells, not arranged in any discernable pattern, in the equatorial / bow region.	"nucleic acid	45	57	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""nucleic acid"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
In the 5 wk alphaA / BKO lenses, nucleic acid staining in the posterior subcapsular region is consistent with either anterior epithelial cells migrating aberrantly to the posterior pole, or primary fiber cells failing to fully differentiate by 5 wks of age.	"nucleic acid	33	45	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""nucleic acid"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Future studies are being designed to address which of these two processes might explain nucleic acid staining in the posterior subcapsular region.	"nucleic acid	88	100	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""nucleic acid"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"

The precise spatial and temporal expression of the crystallin proteins in the developing lens may not be simply a consequence of the differentiation process, but instead may play an important, if not essential, role in the differentiation process itself.

Several heat shock proteins have been found in cell nuclei in the absence of stress [ 30], and alpha - crystallin has been shown to interact directly with DNA [ 18].	"proteins	19	27	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""proteins"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
AlphaB, expressed in transfected CHO cells, has been shown to ectopically localize to interphase nuclei, suggesting a regulatory role for this protein in the nucleus [ 19].	"protein	143	150	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
In the current study, the observation of a disorganized pattern of nuclei localized to the equatorial bow region of alphaA / BKO lenses, and nucleic acid staining of structures throughout the anterior cortex of 54 wk alphaA / BKO lenses, is consistent with a role for alpha - crystallin in the nucleus.

This structural model should be useful in the search for the physiological substrates of these enzymes and in the design of more specific inhibitors of CLN2.	"inhibitors	138	148	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""inhibitors"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
This important observation was followed by the identification of CLN2 as a serine peptidase [ 3, 4], without, however, specifying its structural fold and the details of the catalytic site.

The full - length enzymes consist of 563 amino acids arranged in a single polypeptide chain containing both the prosegment and the catalytic domain, with the exception of mouse CLN2 that has a single deletion in the prosegment.

It must be stressed that these modifications are speculative and may lead to prediction of several incorrect amino acids; however, they bring the two sequences into good global agreement ( 69% identities and 83% similarities).

The medical importance of CLN2 and the lack of a crystal structure inspired attempts at protein modeling.	"protein	88	95	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
However, in view of the subsequently obtained structures of the fully water - soluble sedolisins, this model was clearly incorrect.	"water	70	75	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""water"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
The primary basis of the homology model was the structure of a complex of sedolisin with a covalently - bound inhibitor, pseudo - iodotyrostatin.	"inhibitor	110	119	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""inhibitor"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Another reason for the modeling of a pseudo - iodotyrostatin complex is that CLN2 is a tripeptidase, and that this inhibitor it represents the only experimental structure of a tripeptide analog bound to sedolisin.	"inhibitor	115	124	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""inhibitor"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Interestingly, the Cys327 and Cys342 residues in the model were found to be ideally positioned to form a disulfide bond even though this was not part of the design strategy.	"residues	37	45	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""residues"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Side chains of the residues that were found to be mutated in the genes of families of patients with late - infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis [ 17] are marked in ball - and - stick.

The right - hand side of the pocket ( in the view used in Figure 6) is made of the main chain including residues 164 - 165 ( unless otherwise indicated, the numbering refers to the sequence of the mature human CLN2).	"residues	104	112	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""residues"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
This part of the main chain is held in place through a hydrogen - bonded interaction with the side chain of Thr279, part of the signature sequence SGTSAS surrounding the catalytic Ser280 and its equivalents in the other enzymes.	"hydrogen	55	63	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""hydrogen"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
No side chains point into the pocket from there, though, so its importance is limited to providing a steric barrier and excluding solvent.	"solvent	130	137	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""solvent"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Another wall of the pocket is made up of the main chain of residues 130 - 132 that flank the conserved Gly131.	"residues	59	67	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""residues"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Again, this part of the chain does not provide any specific interactions with the P1 residue of the substrate.	"residue	85	92	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""residue"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
The enzyme is shown in complex with pseudo - iodotyrostatin, a good inhibitor of the sedolisin family of peptidases.	"inhibitor	68	77	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""inhibitor"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Other polar residues in the vicinity are Glu175 in sedolisin and the corresponding Asp169 in kumamolisin.	"residues	12	20	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""residues"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
However, the residue found here in CLN2 is Cys170, much less polar than its counterparts.	"residue	13	20	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""residue"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
There is also no equivalent to the polar interaction between Glu175 and Glu171 in sedolisin, since the equivalent of the latter residue in CLN2 is Ser166, much smaller and pointing away.	"residue	128	135	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""residue"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
The side of the S1 pocket that is created by the very flexible side chain of Arg179 in sedolisin contains only a much smaller Ser174 in CLN2, and thus is much more open in the latter protein.	"protein	183	190	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 183, ""end_span"": 190, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
In summary, the S1 pocket in CLN2 has less polar character than the equivalent pocket in the related proteins, and is lacking direct polar anchors for any side chains that might be present in the substrate.	"proteins	101	109	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""proteins"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
The S2 pocket in CLN2 is also quite open and accessible to solvent.	"solvent	59	66	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""solvent"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
It is most likely larger than the equivalent pockets in either sedolisin or kumamolisin, since these are limited by Trp81 in the former and Trp129 in the latter ( these residues originate from different parts of the backbone in the two enzymes and are not topologically related).	"residues	169	177	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""residues"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 177, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
The only negatively charged residue of CLN2 that is found in this vicinity is Asp132.	"residue	28	35	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""residue"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Such a conformational change would involve breaking of the hydrogen bond between Asp132 and Ser139.	"hydrogen	59	67	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""hydrogen"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
However, this latter interaction is not likely to be structurally crucial since the serine is not absolutely conserved in all CLN2 - like enzymes.	"serine	84	90	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""serine"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
However, some of the mutations lead to single amino acid substitutions in the mature enzyme.	"amino acid	46	56	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""amino acid"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Only the role of the latter mutation is completely clear, since it replaces the catalytic serine of CLN2 with a side chain that cannot support its enzymatic activity.	"serine	90	96	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""serine"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
No other residues appear to be located in the immediate vicinity of the substrate.	"residues	9	17	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""residues"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Residues Val190, Gly194, and Arg252 are very highly conserved not only in CLN2 but also in other sedolisins and must play an important structural role.	"Residues	0	8	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Residues"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"

CLN2 is capable of processing a number of different angiotensin - derived peptides [ 19], with the efficiency of cleavage dependent on the length of such peptides.	"angiotensin	52	63	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""angiotensin"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
It has been recently reported that kumamolisin, and particularly a closely related protein from Alicyclobacillus sendaiensis ( kumamolisin - As) can efficiently cleave not only collagen - related peptides, but also native type I collagen [ 23].	"protein	83	90	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Analysis of the model of CLN2 suggests that the size of the S1 subsite is much larger than in either sedolisin or kumamolisin, and thus the use of a large P1 group might be indicated.	"group	158	163	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""group"", ""start_span"": 158, ""end_span"": 163, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Of course, the availability of an experimental crystal structure will make the design of inhibitors easier and we are continuing our efforts to crystallize CLN2 from different sources.

As is expected for a family of proteins, highly - conserved segments were found aligned to the crystal structure - identified core regions of the sedolisin and kumamolisin sequences.

The localization of Tif1 gamma protein appears different from the more diffuse nuclear patterns typically seen in studies of Tif1 alpha ( Remboutsika et al. 2002) or TIF1 beta ( Cammas et al. 2002).	"protein	31	38	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
A recent report demonstrates that TIF1 beta associates with heterochromatin - containing foci after retinoic acid treatment or serum starvation ( Cammas et al. 2002).	"retinoic acid	100	113	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""retinoic acid"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"

In two different murine erythroleukemia cell lines ( MEL and G1E), Tif1 gamma is also expressed in nuclear foci, and even though the overall Tif1 gamma protein level is reduced, this nuclear foci localization does not change with differentiation ( unpublished data).

And as predicted, forced expression of wild - type tif1 gamma mRNA efficiently rescues hematopoiesis in mon mutants and does not perturb hematopoiesis in wild - type embryos ( see Figure 5).

We have also cloned the predicted zebrafish ortholog of tif1 alpha, which is more uniformly expressed in zebrafish embryos like mammalian TIF1 alpha ( Le Douarin et al. 1995; Niederreither et al. 1999) ( see Figures 3A and 4A) and may therefore be available to form hetero - oligomers with Tif1 gamma protein in developing hematopoietic cells.

We reasonably predict that Tif1 gamma protein functions as a transcriptional intermediary factor in hematopoietic progenitor cells given that both TIF1 alpha ( Zhong et al. 1999) and TIF1 beta ( Friedman et al. 1996; Abrink et al. 2001) have been shown to act as intermediary factors that positively or negatively regulate gene transcription.

A comprehensive investigation of apoptotic cell clearance in vivo and in vitro demonstrated that engulfment of apoptotic cells was normal in Ptdsr knockout mice, but Ptdsr - deficient macrophages were impaired in pro - and anti - inflammatory cytokine signaling after stimulation with apoptotic cells or with lipopolysaccharide.

These results clearly contradict the current view that the phosphatidylserine receptor primarily functions in apoptotic cell clearance.	"phosphatidylserine	59	77	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""phosphatidylserine"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells is very distinct from other engulfment processes that result, for example, in the clearance of microorganisms, because engulfment of apoptotic cells triggers the secretion of potent anti - inflammatory and immunosuppressive mediators, whereas pathogen recognition causes the release of pro - inflammatory signals [ 6].

The importance of efficient mechanisms for apoptotic cell clearance in vivo is supported by the observation that autoimmune responses can be provoked in mice when key molecules for apoptotic cell recognition and uptake are missing.

To analyze whether pro - inflammatory signaling is affected in Ptdsr - / - macrophages, we stimulated FLDMs from Ptdsr + / + and Ptdsr - / - mice with LPS and measured levels of tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( TNF - alpha) at different time points after stimulation ( Figure 8c).

Moreover, the double stimulation demonstrated that the LPS - induced TNF - alpha release by Ptdsr - / - macrophages could be inhibited by co - administration of apoptotic cells to an extent comparable to that seen in wild - type macrophages.

In this study, we have generated a null mutation in the phosphatidylserine receptor ( Ptdsr) gene in C57BL / 6J mice.	"phosphatidylserine	56	74	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""phosphatidylserine"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
In all three knockout mouse lines, the first two exons ( [ 31] and this study) or exons one to three [ 32] were deleted by replacement with a neomycin - selection cassette.	"neomycin	142	150	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""neomycin"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"

As recognition of phosphatidylserine is thought to be a universal engulfment mechanism for all cells that are able to phagocytose apoptotic cells, it is very striking that apoptotic cell clearance mediated by non - professional bystander cells is also not compromised by Ptdsr - deficiency.

We performed phagocytosis assays in vitro with fetal - liver - derived macrophages, while in their assays, Li and colleagues used thioglycollate - elicited peritoneal macrophages after adoptive transfer of Ptdsr - / - hematopoietic stem cells.

Thus, it seems possible that recruitment and activation / differentiation of macrophages after adoptive transfer and thioglycollate elicitation are affected by Ptdsr - deficiency.

We do not think that the different results observed in Ptdsr - knockout mice in a mixed C57BL / 6 x 129 background and in a pure C57BL / 6J background can be attributed to genetic background effects: comparison of apoptotic cell engulfment efficacies of thioglycollate - elicited macrophages from 129P2 / OlaHsd and C57BL / 6J mice did not show any differences in apoptotic cell uptake ( J.

A bacterial artificial chromosome ( BAC) containing the Gdf5 locus was modified by homologous recombination in bacteria to insert a cassette encoding Cre - internal ribosome entry site ( IRES) - human placental alkaline phosphatase ( hPLAP) into the translation start site of Gdf5 ( Figure 1A).

At this stage, the Gdf5 gene is normally expressed in stripes that mark the sites of joint formation ( Figure 4F), and the gene for the major collagen protein of cartilage matrix ( Col2a1) is down - regulated in the interzone region ( Figure 4E).

At birth, digit joints were generally indistinguishable from those in control animals; chondrocytes were abundant in articular regions and were surrounded by typical cartilage matrix with normal staining by Safranin O, a histological stain for proteoglycans ( Figure 5).

These results, together with the altered pattern of gene expression seen in our Bmpr1a - deficient mice, suggest that BMPR1A signaling may normally act to stimulate SOX9 by post - translational protein modification, or to induce L - Sox5 or Sox6 in cartilage to maintain expression of ECM components.

TTCC13 and TTCC17 were displaced to a similar extent, consistent with the earlier result that a 40 nt tail is sufficient for activation ( 13).	"nt	50	52	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""nt"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"

Thus, the minimal thymine content required for activation of the Mcm helicase may be somewhere between 33 and 50%.	"thymine	18	25	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""thymine"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
In order to examine other natural replication origins with different thymine contents for the ability to activate Mcm helicase on a bubble substrate, we constructed new bubble substrates, Bub82 / c - myc, containing sequences derived from the DUE ( DNA unwinding element) region of the human c - myc origin which is essential for c - myc replicator activity ( 29, 30).

Our results indicate that thymine - rich single - stranded DNA is required for initial loading and activation of the Mcm helicase.	"thymine	26	33	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""thymine"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"

We have constructed two sets of 5 ' - tailed partial heteroduplex DNA substrates containing duplex regions of variable lengths; one on M13mp18 vector and the other on M13mp19 containing a 66 nt long G - rich segment downstream of the hybridizing oligonucleotide.

Although we cannot totally exclude the possibility that one Mcm4 / 6 / 7 hexamer at each fork unwinds the duplex independently, ring - shaped structures of mouse and archea MCM, as revealed by electron microscopy, bear much similarity to the recently solved structure of the SV40 large T - antigen ( 4, 6), and are in favor of the double - hexameric structure of mouse Mcm on a bubble DNA.

Huntingtin ' s large number of diverse cytoplasmic and nuclear protein binding partners strongly suggest that huntingtin may participate in a variety of cellular processes that range from trafficking of growth factor complexes to gene transcription ( reviewed in [ 5, 8, 9].

However, despite the potential importance of huntingtin ' s normal function to our understanding of how the dominant polyglutamine mutation causes HD pathology, huntingtin ' s precise molecular and cellular activities have not been defined.

( 26) have demonstrated that one recessive allele of Aqp2, P262L, does not properly translocate when expressed by itself in MDCK cells, but that in the presence of wild - type protein, it localizes normally.

In support of this, AQP2 - F204V can interact with wild - type AQP2 ( Figure 5B), and when coexpressed with wild - type protein, AQP2 - F204V can reach the cell surface ( Figure 5C bottom right panel and 5D).

Although it has been demonstrated that a recessive allele ( encoding AQP2 - R187C) of NDI fails to interact with wild - type AQP2 [ 6], here we show that AQP2 - F204V does interact with the wild - type protein, presumably as part of heterotetramers, and represents a rescuable allele, both in vitro and in vivo.

In this study, we investigated the role of Ca2 + - permeable AMPARs in olfactory behavior.	"Ca2 +	43	48	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Ca2 +"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
GluR - B is critically involved in the formation and trafficking of AMPARs, and dominates their ion conductance and gating properties [ 40 - 46].	"ion	45	48	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""ion"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Thus, the absence of GluR - B, or the expression of GluR - B ( Q) in the olfactory bulb, may generate increased inhibition in mitral cells.	"Q	63	64	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Q"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Similarly, changes in synaptic plasticity due to Ca2 + - permeable AMPARs [ 51, 52, 60], e. g., in piriform cortex, might alter odor memorization processes.	"Ca2 +	49	54	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Ca2 +"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"

GluR - B Delta ECS: FB mice had, in contrast to mice expressing GluR - B ( Q) globally, a prolonged lifespan and no severe developmental alterations.	"Q	75	76	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Q"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Thus, expression of Ca2 + - permeable AMPARs in forebrain areas, including the olfactory bulb, resulted in more rapid odor learning and enhanced olfactory discrimination.	"Ca2 +	20	25	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Ca2 +"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Thus, this suggests that increased Ca2 + influx via AMPARs leads to enhanced olfactory learning and discrimination.	"Ca2 +	35	40	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Ca2 +"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
To capture the full extent of the role of Ca2 + - permeable AMPARs in olfactory behavior, we next assessed the effects of altered AMPA channels on olfactory memory.	"Ca2 +	42	47	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Ca2 +"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
To probe olfactory memory in GluR - B Delta FB mice, six days after the end of the first training phase for odor discrimination ( amylacetate versus ethylbutyrate), the training trials for the third odor pair ( pelargonic versus valeric acid) were interleaved with unrewarded trials in which amylacetate or ethylbutyrate were again presented ( black bar in Figure 2C).

Thus, to examine whether the pronounced variability of olfactory memory in GluR - B Delta FB mice ( Figure 2E) reflects variability of GluR - B levels in GluR - B Delta FB mice, we analyzed the residual amount of GluR - B protein in mice with disparate memory performances ( Figure 4A - C).	"protein	222	229	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 222, ""end_span"": 229, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Notably, mice with pronounced memory deficits ( memory < 70%) showed essentially no detectable GluR - B protein in hippocampus, amygdala, olfactory bulb, and piriform cortex ( n = 2, Figure 4B, and unpublished data), but mice with almost complete memory displayed substantial residual GluR - B levels in all brain areas investigated ( n = 2, Figure 4B, and unpublished data).	"protein	104	111	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
To quantify the relation between residual GluR - B protein and olfactory memory, the memory experiment was repeated with nine additional GluR - B Delta FB mice and two GluR - B2lox control animals ( indicated with shaded symbols in Figure 4A), resulting in the same mean, variability, and range of memory performance ( control: 89 +/- 10%; GluR - B Delta FB: 63 +/- 14%).	"protein	51	58	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
The mouse line employed for this purpose, termed GluR - BRescue, had the genetic background of GluR - B Delta FB mice but additionally carried a bidirectional module for beta - galactosidase and GFPGluR - B expression, responsive to the tetracycline - controlled transcriptional transactivator [ 62].	"tetracycline	237	249	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""tetracycline"", ""start_span"": 237, ""end_span"": 249, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
In the olfactory memory experiments with GluR - B Delta FB animals, olfactory memory linearly depended on GluR - B expression in cortex and hippocampus with a slope of 9. 1 +/- 2. 5% ( cortex) and 8. 9 +/- 2. 0% ( hippocampus) increase in memory per 10% increase in protein ( Figure 4D).	"protein	266	273	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 266, ""end_span"": 273, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
This confirms the role of these brain areas as inferred from the mosaic expression and protein correlation analysis described above ( Figure 4).	"protein	87	94	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
However, odor discrimination ( measured by the discrimination index as in Figures 1, 2, and 4D) was as enhanced as in GluR - B Delta FB mice ( 0. 79 +/- 0. 05, mean +/- SEM compared with 0. 76 +/- 0. 02, p > 0. 7, Figure 6C), and improved relative to GluR - B2lox controls ( 0. 48 +/- 0. 06; Figure 6C; overall ANOVA: F ( 2, 41) = 17. 2, p < 10 - 5; post hoc Newman Keuls: p < 10 - 3), as expected if the enhanced discrimination phenotype is due to Ca2 + - permeable AMPARs in the olfactory bulb and unaffected by GluR - B expression in piriform cortex or hippocampus.	"Ca2 +	449	454	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Ca2 +"", ""start_span"": 449, ""end_span"": 454, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
This variability could be traced to epigenetic variability in the transgenic expression of Cre - recombinase, which mediated recombination within loxP - flanked segments of gene - targeted alleles for the dominant AMPAR subunit GluR - B, and hence operated the switch in AMPAR properties toward GluR - B ablation and increased Ca2 + permeability.	"Ca2 +	327	332	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Ca2 +"", ""start_span"": 327, ""end_span"": 332, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
In a nutshell, we conclude that olfactory discrimination is enhanced by an increase in AMPAR - mediated Ca2 + permeability within the olfactory bulb, whereas olfactory memory becomes impaired upon genetically induced GluR - B ablation in higher brain centers, specifically in piriform cortex.

Both forebrain - specific GluR - B ( Q) expression and GluR - B depletion led to increased olfactory learning and discrimination capabilities.	"Q	37	38	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Q"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
This was rather pronounced for GluR - B ( Q) - expressing mice, consistent with the overall stronger phenotypic consequences in comparison to GluR - B depletion, both when forebrain - selective ( [ 58], and this study) or global [ 53, 60].	"Q	42	43	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Q"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Alternatively, transgenic protein levels might have been too low to alter discrimination and learning capabilities, although memory was clearly affected.	"protein	26	33	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
In both mouse models Ca2 + influx through AMPA channels is increased, whereas the effect on the macroscopic AMPA conductance differs.	"Ca2 +	21	26	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Ca2 +"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
The milder phenotype upon GluR - B depletion could be attributed to reduced AMPAR densities at synapses [ 40, 41] and therefore probably to a lesser extent of Ca2 + influx.	"Ca2 +	159	164	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Ca2 +"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 164, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
"Increased inhibition will thus in general improve discriminability, consistent with the behavioral improvements observed with GluR - B ( Q) expression, the GluR - B knockout, and the "" rescue "" mice."	"Q	137	138	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Q"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Transgenic expression of GFPGluR - B in piriform cortex and hippocampus indeed rescued memory to an extent strikingly consistent with the transgenic protein levels ( approximately 10% of wild - type GluR - B), confirming the reliability of the correlation analysis and the sensitivity of the behavioral assay.	"protein	149	156	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 149, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Mechanistically, this is likely to be due to Ca2 + influx through GluR - B - less AMPA channels leading to non - hebbian forms of plasticity.	"Ca2 +	45	50	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Ca2 +"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Surprisingly, in GluR - B Delta FB mice no LTP changes could be observed in field measurements in the hippocampus, nor could NMDA - independent LTP be induced in hippocampal synapses between Schaffer collaterals and CA1 pyramidal cells in presence of the NMDA antagonist APV ( K. Jensen, O. Hvalby, personal communication).	"antagonist	260	270	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""antagonist"", ""start_span"": 260, ""end_span"": 270, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Other forms of plasticity [ 77, 78] induced by Ca2 + - permeable AMPARs might play a prevalent role in olfactory memory.	"Ca2 +	47	52	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Ca2 +"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
One possibility would be Cre - mediated GluR - B depletion and GluR - B ( Q) expression in piriform cortex as suggested above.	"Q	74	75	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Q"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
A critical step in discerning the discrimination and learning phenotypes from the memory phenotype was the observation of increased variability in the memory of the GluR - B knockout animals and, subsequently, the individual analyses of protein expression levels.

"Herein, we described a way to enhance the signal - to - noise ratio by making use of the mosaic expression often associated with transgenic approaches: combining the advantages of "" classical "" genetic manipulation -- namely, that the target of the manipulation is well defined -- with the possibility to analyze variability, might also in future provide novel ways to define molecular and cellular correlates of complex behavioral traits."

In contrast, in BC individuals samples CEBPG was not correlated with any of the antioxidant or DNA repair genes.	"antioxidant	80	91	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""antioxidant"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"

These hypotheses are supported by the findings that a) there was large inter - individual variation in transcript levels of CEBPG and each of the target genes and in non - BC individuals, b) CEBPG transcript abundance values were significantly correlated by bivariate analysis with the transcript abundance values of four key antioxidant and DNA repair genes in non - BC individuals, and c) that there was no correlation between CEBPG and these genes in BC individuals.

Of particular note is the lack of correlation of the target genes with CEBPB, which binds to the same recognition site as CEBPG, and shares its recognition site within each of the antioxidant or DNA repair genes.

One possibility is that CEBPG and each of the correlated antioxidant or DNA repair genes is regulated by a transcription factor that is as yet undiscovered, and / or has a recognition site that is not yet known and was not in the Genomatix software database.

However, based on the preponderance of data thus far available, we conclude that CEBPG is responsible for optimal transcriptional regulation of key antioxidant or DNA repair genes in NBEC and that there is inter - individual variation in the regulation of each of these genes by CEBPG.

Compared to a standard APP transgenic line used for previous amyloid studies by our laboratory ( line C3 - 3; [ 15, 26, 27]), we estimated that the four controllable lines produce transgenic APP protein at 10 - to 30 - fold over endogenous levels ( Figure S1).

The residual expression remaining in acutely treated mice represents less than 4% of the transgenic protein produced in the absence of dox ( Figure 1C), and likely results from slight leakage at the level of transcription ( data not shown).

Consistent with the reduction in full - length APPswe / ind synthesis shown by immunoblot ( see Figure 1), we found that transgene - derived A beta levels were completely suppressed in animals born and raised on dox, and were sharply reduced following acute ( 2 wk) antibiotic treatment.

Similarly, SDS - soluble A beta 42 decreased by 75. 2% and 94. 8% following 2 - wk or lifelong dox treatment ( Figure 2B).	"SDS	11	14	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""SDS"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Only the FA fraction revealed a small dox - resistant pool of peptide in acutely treated animals that we believe represents stable predeposit aggregates that have already accumulated by 4 wk of age when treatment was begun ( Figure 2C).

Using the Campbell - Switzer silver stain to distinguish different forms of amyloid, we found diffuse plaques were as persistent as cored deposits ( Figure S4).	"silver	29	35	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""silver"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"

The tTA / APP animals were often seen running in circles around the perimeter of their cages, and a similar swimming pattern was noted when the mice were tested in the Morris water maze.

This phenotype has not affected previous lines of APPswe mice we have produced, such as lines E1 - 2 or C3 - 3, that express lower levels of transgenic protein.	"protein	152	159	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 152, ""end_span"": 159, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
New lines of transgenic mice were developed for this study that express high levels of APPswe / ind under the control of a tetracycline - responsive promoter.	"tetracycline	123	135	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""tetracycline"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Importantly, this outcome occurs in animals already harboring considerable amyloid pathology, a situation similar to what might be expected in patients to be treated with secretase inhibitors.	"inhibitors	181	191	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""inhibitors"", ""start_span"": 181, ""end_span"": 191, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
This latter finding indicates that compared to other disease - associated protein aggregates such as mutant huntingtin, which clear in less than 3 mo [ 32], the disaggregation of extracellular amyloid is relatively slow.	"protein	74	81	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Two independent compounds tested in Tg2576 [ 33] and TgCRND8 [ 34] transgenic mice show no more than 85% suppression of A beta 40 levels, and where measured, even less suppression of A beta 42 ( approximately 60%) [ 35, 36].	"compounds	16	25	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""compounds"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Thus, even after accounting for the much higher APP expression levels in our mice than in the Tg2576 and TgCRND8 lines, we have achieved better absolute suppression of A beta production with the tet - off system than is currently possible with published gamma - secretase inhibitors.	"inhibitors	272	282	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""inhibitors"", ""start_span"": 272, ""end_span"": 282, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
However, this outcome may be alternatively explained by direct effects of many anti - inflammatory drugs on gamma - secretase cleavage [ 44 - 47].	"anti - inflammatory drugs	79	104	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""anti - inflammatory drugs"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
However, if dox does have anti - inflammatory activity, then, based on previous studies with other anti - inflammatories, we would have expected to find less amyloid in the dox - treated animals.	"anti - inflammatories	99	120	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""anti - inflammatories"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Consistent with this hypothesis, strong activation of microglia through transgenic expression of TGF beta [ 58] or central injection of lipopolysaccharide [ 59, 60] can by itself substantially reduce plaque burden in APP transgenic mice.

The lack of clearance in both models of AD pathology comes as a stark contrast to the rapid removal of protein aggregates found in similar tet - off mouse models of Huntington [ 32] and prion disease [ 62].	"protein	103	110	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
In these cases, disrupting the input of new monomer to the system via dox - mediated transgene suppression led to relatively rapid clearance of protein aggregates.	"protein	144	151	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
By contrast, our study and that of SantaCruz et al. suggest that protein aggregates in AD may be more tenacious than in other neurodegenerative disorders.	"protein	65	72	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Perhaps once aggregated, A beta and tau are either inherently more stable than other protein aggregates or more resistant to intra - and extracellular clearance mechanisms.	"protein	85	92	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Studies from the tet - off tau mice suggest that protein clearance may in fact not be required for cognitive improvement following transgene suppression [ 61].	"protein	49	56	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""protein"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Many of the double transgenic mice showed similar circular patterns of swimming near the edge of the tank when tested in the Morris water maze.	"water	132	137	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""water"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
However, if started early enough in the course of disease, secretase inhibitors alone could provide substantial benefit in slowing pathogenic processes linked to amyloid deposition.

However, the development of safe and effective secretase inhibitors will ultimately be required to determine whether the human brain has the capacity to repair amyloid - associated damage of AD once the progression of pathology is arrested.

While the function of this evolutionary conserved histone chaperone has been studied extensively biochemically, we still lack information concerning its importance during early development in mammals and in pluripotent cells such as embryonic stem ( ES) cells.
