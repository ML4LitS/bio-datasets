The DNA substrate contains a pair of mutated GFP genes ( GFP encodes the easily detected green fluorescent protein), one of which contains a restriction site for I - SceI, a yeast intron encoded endonuclease with an 18 base pair recognition site.

The different lines examined, however, are very likely to differ genetically from CAPAN - 1 cells not only at the BRCA2 locus, but also at a very large number of additional loci.

This raises the possibility that some or even all of the recombinational repair defect seen in CAPAN - 1 could be due to mutations at non - BRCA2 loci.	"BRCA2	140	145	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BRCA2"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
While Moynahan et al were careful to point out this problem, two sets of results argue against the possibility that the recombinational repair deficiency of CAPAN - 1 cells is completely independent of its defect in BRCA2.

First, in the same study [ 24], recombination in a mouse ES cell line that expresses only truncated BRCA2 protein was measured.	"BRCA2	100	105	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BRCA2"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This line was found to have lower recombination efficiency than isogenic cells expressing full - length BRCA2 ( the defect observed was about fivefold to sixfold).

Second, in an independent study, Powell was able to compare derivatives of CAPAN - 1 that differed only in their ability to express full - length BRCA2 protein ( S.

Furthermore, the discrepancy between the 100 - fold difference between CAPAN - 1 and the other human lines as compared with the fivefold to sixfold difference between the Brca2lex1 / lex2cells and Brca2 + / + ES cells might simply be accounted for by the fact that Brca2lex1 / lex2 is not a null allele.

These investigators showed that expression of constructs containing the BRC4 repeat in MCF - 7 cells enhances the radiosensitivity of cells and blocks both the G2 / M delay associated with damage and the ability of the transfected cells to assembly subnuclear RAD51 foci.

It had been shown previously that the small amount of truncated BRCA2 protein expressed by CAPAN - 1 cells was mislocalized to the cytoplasm, consistent with the fact that the truncation protein lacks a nuclear localization signal [ 28].

Likewise, the innervation of the apex ( Fig. 2f) shows no detectable abnormality in overall pattern of innervation compared to control animals ( data not shown), an indication that BDNF could be expressed in the apex [ 6].

Afferents reach all three rows of outer hair cells in the basal turn of control wildtype littermates ( Fig. 2c), but both afferent and efferent outgrowth is disorganized to outer hair cells in Brn3c null mutants ( Fig. 2d) and does not show any clear organization into three distinct longitudinal fiber bundles paralleling the three rows in the outer hair cell region.

However, the apex of Brn3c null mutants, which retains most of the spiral neuron afferents at 6 - month, shows no formation of mature hair cells at any time surveyed here ( P0, P8, P10).

Formation of radial fibers that bring peripheral processes of spiral neurons to the organ of Corti seems to be rather normal, even in the apex of the cochlea which does not even develop immature hair cells recognizable by Myo VIIa.

Specifically, efferent fibers may suffer the same loss of their molecularly unknown neurotrophic support as do afferents and therefore show the same spatio - temporal profile of loss ( Fig. 3).

Neurotransmission heavily relies on membrane vesicle transport, and a high - energy metabolism may further sensitize neurons to the loss of battenin activity.

Thus, our panel of wild - type, heterozygous, and homozygous CbCln3 Delta ex7 / 8 cerebellar cells provide an ideal model system to further elucidate battenin function and JNCL pathogenesis.

In the epidermis, Snail misexpression leads to hyperproliferation and a reduction in intercellular adhesion.	"Snail	18	23	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
When E - cadherin is transcriptionally down - regulated, associated adhesion proteins with dual functions in signaling are released from cell - cell contacts, a process which we demonstrate leads to Ras - MAPK activation.	"E - cadherin	5	17	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""E - cadherin"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This provides a framework for conceptualizing why E - cadherin levels appear to impact upon a plethora of developmental processes ( reviewed in [ 11]).

Bud formation differs from an EMT in that E - cadherin activity needs to be down - regulated but not prevented, so that adhesive junctions are remodeled rather than quantitatively impaired.	"E - cadherin	42	54	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""E - cadherin"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thereafter, Snail disappears and remains absent during subsequent follicle down - growth and maturation.	"Snail	12	17	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This exquisite pattern appears to be functionally relevant since altering it in vivo correspondingly affects features associated with hair bud formation, including down - regulation of E - cadherin, increased proliferation, and repressed terminal differentiation.

Our studies point to the view that Snail likely functions downstream of cell fate specification, at a stage where the bud begins to exhibit enhanced proliferation and migration.

Although Snail family members are most frequently associated with EMTs, they also participate in many malignant processes involving a down - regulation but not a quantitative abrogation of intercellular junctions [ 18].	"Snail	9	14	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The range of developmental processes in which Snail family members have been implicated thus includes the type of epithelial remodeling that is observed in hair follicle bud formation.

Embryonic day 17. 5 ( E17. 5) was chosen, since the multiple waves of follicle morphogenesis occurring at this time enabled us to evaluate Snail expression at different stages of the process.	"Snail	139	144	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The transient nature of Snail mRNA expression during follicle development was most apparent in hybridized skin sections containing follicles from two different waves of morphogenesis ( as shown in Figure 1).	"Snail	24	29	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
To determine whether this transient nature of Snail mRNA expression is reflected at the protein level, we generated an antibody against the N - terminal sequence that resides upstream of the more conserved zinc finger domains.	"Snail	46	51	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
As judged by Western blot analysis, the antibody did not detect endogenous proteins from cultured keratinocytes, but it did yield a band of the expected size from keratinocytes transiently expressing a hemagglutinin ( HA) - tagged Snail protein ( Figure 1B).	"Snail	231	236	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 231, ""end_span"": 236, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The antibody also recognized a band corresponding to the size of endogenous Snail ( approximately 28 kDa) in lysates from embryonic mouse skin, the temporal appearance of which corresponded to the waves of hair follicle morphogenesis from E15. 5 to newborn when over 90% of the hair on the mouse is formed ( Figure 1B).	"Snail	76	81	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Consistent with the Western blot data, immunohistochemical analysis did not detect Snail in single - layered E13. 5 epidermis ( Figure 1C) nor in the placode, which is the earliest morphological sign of the commitment of multipotent cells of the embryonic ectoderm to a hair cell fate ( Figure 1D).	"Snail	83	88	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Consistent with the in situ hybridization results, anti - Snail antibody labeled only hair buds and not follicles at more mature stages of development ( Figure 1E).	"Snail	58	63	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Taken together, the anti - Snail antibody appeared to be specific for its target protein.	"Snail	27	32	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
It did not detect other Snail family members known to be expressed in keratinocytes and / or skin ( unpublished data).	"Snail	24	29	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
As judged by immunohistochemistry, Snail protein was localized to the nuclei of the hair bud cells ( Figure 1E).	"Snail	35	40	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This feature was consistent with Snail ' s known function as a transcriptional repressor [ 12, 13].	"Snail	33	38	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Additionally, anti - Snail labeling was detected in only three of the four major waves of follicle morphogenesis.	"Snail	21	26	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Snail was not found in the buds of guard hairs that are the earliest of all hairs to form ( at E13. 5), and which constitute less than 5% of the mouse coat ( unpublished data).

Immunohistochemistry with antibodies against the active ( phosphorylated) form of MAPK ( pMAPK) marked a subset of the proliferating ( Ki67 - positive) cells, and pMAPK - positive cells were enriched in the hair bud ( Figure 1G).

However, like placodes, hair buds exhibited down - regulation in E - cadherin expression ( Figure 1H; see also [ 4]).	"E - cadherin	65	77	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""E - cadherin"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

These hyperthickened areas were marked by excessive proliferation, as revealed by antibodies against the proliferating nuclear antigen Ki67 ( Figure 2D and 2E).	"Ki67	135	139	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ki67"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Activated, pMAPK - positive cells were also prevalent in these areas ( Figure 2F and 2G), as were cells expressing keratin 6, a keratin induced in the suprabasal layers of hyperproliferative skin ( Figure 2H and 2I).

Expression of the Snail transgene did not block terminal differentiation in the hyperproliferative epidermis, but it distorted it markedly ( Figure 3A - 3H).	"Snail	18	23	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Typical of most hyperproliferating conditions, Snail expression led to a large expansion in layers with spinous and granular morphology.	"Snail	47	52	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
With age, however, epidermal folds and undulations developed in areas where Snail was expressed, and proliferative markers persisted in these regions ( Figure 3I and 3J; anti - cyclin D staining).

However, in regions such as ear skin, where the highest levels of Snail protein were expressed, the effects were accentuated.	"Snail	66	71	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Rather, the findings are consistent with a previous report that E - cadherin is required for the translation of alpha - catenin mRNA [ 22].	"E - cadherin	64	76	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""E - cadherin"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The similarities between Snail Tg epidermis and hair buds extended to the hyperproliferative state, leading us to wonder whether the down - regulation of AJ proteins might contribute to this condition.

Although this pathway provides one mechanism by which Snail expression and proliferation may be coupled in skin epithelium, proliferative circuitries involving AJs are known to be complex and often interwoven.

In contrast, Snail expression was not induced by these conditions ( Figure 5A).	"Snail	13	18	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In keratinocytes, however, TGF - beta 1 inhibits keratinocyte growth and seems to be involved in triggering the destructive phase of the cycling hair follicle [ 32].

Following this treatment, Snail protein was detected within 30 min, peaked at 2 h, and then declined thereafter.	"Snail	26	31	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
To test this possibility, we engineered a transgene driving the beta - galactosidase reporter under the control of approximately 2. 2 kb of promoter sequence located 5 ' from the transcription initiation site of the mouse Snail gene.

Thereafter, Snail promoter activity rapidly returned to the basal levels seen in unstimulated keratinocytes.	"Snail	12	17	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Consistent with previous observations [ 33], an anti - TGF - beta 2 antibody labeled developing hair buds ( Figure 6A).	"TGF - beta 2	55	67	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""TGF - beta 2"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This labeling appeared to be specific as judged by the lack of staining in follicle buds from mice homozygous for a TGF - beta 2 null mutation ( Figure 6A; [ 34]).	"TGF - beta 2	116	128	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""TGF - beta 2"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Whether pMARK activity also contributes to Snail induction was not addressed in the present study [ 15].	"Snail	43	48	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Although some hair buds still formed in TGF - beta 2 null skin, their number was reduced by approximately 50% [ 32].	"TGF - beta 2	40	52	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""TGF - beta 2"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, although the pathway mediated by TGF - beta 2 signaling impacts the earliest step of epithelial invagination, it does not appear to be essential for bud morphogenesis.

Hence, when TGF - beta 2 protein was detected at the transition between the growing and destructive phases of the adult hair cycle, research initially and naturally focused on a role for this family member in cessation of growth and / or triggering apoptosis ( [ 42] and references therein).

Thus, we surmise that the proliferative outcome is likely to be rooted in differences in the repertoire of activated SMAD target genes.	"SMAD	117	121	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""SMAD"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In this regard, the positive effects of TGF - beta 2 on proliferation within the hair bud may be more analogous to what has been seen in progression of squamous cell carcinoma to metastatic carcinoma [ 43] rather than that typically observed for keratinocytes [ 44, 45, 46].

One obvious factor is the K14 promoter, which is elevated in the basal layer of the epidermis and the outer root sheath ( ORS) of the hair follicle, but is markedly down - regulated in developing embryonic hair buds as well as in the postnatal hair progenitor cells.

It was initially proposed that these vesicles were due to the breakdown of outer segment membranes that were not properly recruited to the outer segments in the absence of peripherin, or were from the result of the breakdown of the microvilli of M u ller cells [ 30].

Using northern blots [ 34], microarrays [ 10], and serial analysis of gene expression ( SAGE) [ 35], we have defined a large number of genes that are altered in their expression level in Crx - / - mice.

In addition, the timing of rhodopsin expression may be very important, as indicated by studies in Drosophila.	"rhodopsin	27	36	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""rhodopsin"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
[ 43] demonstrated a temporal requirement for rhodopsin expression during rhabdomere development.	"rhodopsin	46	55	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""rhodopsin"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Heat shock during the normal time of rhodopsin onset resulted in substantial and long - lasting rescue of photoreceptor structure and transient rescue of photoreceptor physiology.

However, expression shortly before or after this critical period failed to rescue, suggesting that rhodopsin expression during a discrete window of time in development is essential for proper rhabdomere morphogenesis.

This result is consistent with observations in the rat wherein rhodopsin onset occurs with strict timing in the developmental history of most rods in vivo [ 44].

Interestingly, in one hypomorphic allele of Drosophila otd, otduvi, photoreceptor morphogenesis is also disrupted [ 45].	"Drosophila otd	44	58	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila otd"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We found that there are many other genes that are dependent upon Crx.	"Crx	65	68	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Crx"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, the spontaneously occurring mouse mutant in CRB1, the Rd8 mouse, develops shortened outer segments that subsequently degenerate [ 48], suggesting that photoreceptor polarization and synaptogenesis are intact in this mutant.

The peripherin - / - mouse develops a normal complement of photoreceptor terminals which then degenerate as the photoreceptors are lost [ 30].	"peripherin	4	14	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""peripherin"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In keeping with this observation is the fact that some electroretinogram activity is present in peripherin - / - mice, suggesting that minimal phototransduction is present in these mice, enough to drive activity at the photoreceptor synapse.	"peripherin	96	106	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""peripherin"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
These data then suggest that the fact that the Crx - / - photoreceptors do not have proper synaptic endings is not due to a lack of outer segment formation.	"Crx	47	50	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Crx"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
A more likely explanation is that Crx plays a role in photoreceptor synapse formation, perhaps by regulating directly, or indirectly, important genes in this process.	"Crx	34	37	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Crx"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, since other genes expressed in photoreceptors were significantly altered in their expression level in the Crx - / - mouse, there are many candidates that could be important for photoreceptor morphogenesis.

Recent evidence points toward a transcriptional coactivator, peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - gamma ( PPAR gamma) coactivator - 1 alpha ( PGC - 1 alpha), as an integrator of the molecular regulatory circuitry involved in the transcriptional control of cellular energy metabolism, including mitochondrial function and biogenesis [ 1, 2].

To determine whether mitochondrial function was altered in the skeletal muscle of PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice, mitochondrial respiration rates were measured using tissue strips prepared from soleus muscle.

State 4 respiration rates ( in the presence of oligomycin) were also similar between the genotypes, indicating that the coupling of respiration to ATP production was not significantly altered in PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice.

"Specifically, PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice made significantly fewer entries into, spent significantly less time in, and traveled a significantly shorter distance in the central area of the "" field, "" although differences in distance traveled in the peripheral zone of the "" field "" was not significantly different between groups ( Figure S2)."

These data suggest that the general activity level may have been affected by the reluctance of the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice to go into the central area of the field and thus remain in the periphery ( thigmotaxis), possibly reflecting altered emotionality such as increased fear.

These results, together with the observed abnormalities in skeletal muscle mitochondrial structure and function, indicate that PGC - 1 alpha is necessary for functional adaptation of skeletal muscle to physiologic demands.

Given that the exercise capacity of PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice is diminished, a series of preliminary treadmill exercise studies were performed to define a reasonable exercise duration for run - to - exhaustion to be used as a target duration for the EST.

Previous studies have implicated PGC - 1 alpha in several hepatic metabolic functions including fatty acid oxidation and gluconeogenesis [ 18, 19, 20, 21].

Under basal fed conditions, the livers of the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice appeared grossly normal and did not exhibit histologic abnormalities ( unpublished data).

However, following a 24 h - fast, the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice exhibited marked hepatic steatosis as determined by gross inspection, oil red O staining, electron microscopy, and measurements of liver triglyceride ( TAG) levels ( Figure 7).

To further investigate the mechanisms involved in the fasting - induced hepatic steatotic response, hepatocytes were isolated from PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice and WT controls.

Taken together, these latter results indicate a cell - autonomous defect in PGC - 1 alpha - / - hepatocytes that results in an inability to maintain cellular lipid balance in the context of increased delivery of lipid such as occurs with fasting.

PPAR, a known regulator of hepatic mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation enzyme gene expression, is a target for coactivation by PGC - 1 alpha [ 31].

Therefore, we sought to determine whether the steatotic phenotype of the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice related to reduced expression of PPAR target genes.

Next, we performed experiments to determine whether the reduced capacity for fat oxidation in the hepatocytes of the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice was related to altered mitochondrial respiratory function.

Previous studies using gain - of - function strategies have shown that the coactivator PGC - 1 alpha is capable of coactivating an array of transcription factors involved in energy metabolic processes including fatty acid oxidation, electron transport, and oxidative phosphorylation [ 6].

The basis for the observed abnormalities of cardiac heart rate, including a blunted response to beta - adrenergic stimulation, is unknown, but could be related to the effects of late - stage growth arrest and corresponding derangements in energy metabolism on sinus node function.

Following short - term starvation, we found that the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice developed marked hepatocyte triglyceride accumulation.	"PGC - 1 alpha	53	66	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Further analysis revealed that palmitate oxidation rates were reduced in hepatocytes isolated from the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice, which would predispose to lipid accumulation.

Indeed, the relative contribution of increased triglyceride synthesis rates to the steatotic phenotype cannot be fully discerned from our data, given that this response could reflect the direct effects of PGC - 1 alpha deficiency on target genes or a secondary compensatory response to hepatocyte fatty acid accumulation.

It is possible that a reduction in systemic energy utilization, related to the mitochondrial dysfunction, leads to increased fat mass and weight gain in the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice.

Clearly, future studies of male and female PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice in pure - strain backgrounds over a range of ages will be necessary to fully investigate the observed abnormalities in weight control and fat distribution.

Inspection of sections prepared from the brains of PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice revealed patchy areas of microvacuolation in the pyramidal neurons of the cerebral cortex, accompanied by a mild increase in the number of astrocytes in the basal ganglia.

These deficits are likely due to impaired muscle strength in the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice, but contributions by peripheral or central nervous system determinants ( or both) could be contributory.

Moreover, evidence of altered emotionality from the 1 - h locomotor activity test also suggests the possibility of altered brain function in PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice.

It will be of interest to determine whether the neurologic abnormalities contribute to the systemic metabolic abnormalities of the PGC - 1 alpha null mice.

During the preparation of this manuscript, Lin et al. reported an independent mouse line in which the PGC - 1 alpha gene was targeted [ 37].	"PGC - 1 alpha	102	115	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Phenotypic comparison of the our PGC - 1 alpha - deficient line with that of Lin et al. reveals a number of similarities and several interesting differences.

Both PGC - 1 alpha - deficient lines exhibit cold intolerance, reduced hepatocyte respiration rates, and neurologic lesions.	"PGC - 1 alpha	5	18	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
First, in contrast to Lin et al., the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice described here do not exhibit any postnatal mortality.	"PGC - 1 alpha	38	51	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We have also found that male PGC - 1 alpha - deficient mice are somewhat protected against diet - induced obesity ( Figure S4).	"PGC - 1 alpha	29	42	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Fourth, the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice described here exhibit a dramatic fasting - induced hepatic steatotic phenotype, whereas the Lin et al. mouse does not.

Fifth, Lin et al. found a neurologic phenotype in males characterized by hyperactivity, whereas the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice described here show reduced locomotor activity.	"PGC - 1 alpha	100	113	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The reasons for the interesting differences between the two PGC - 1 alpha - deficient mouse lines are not clear.	"PGC - 1 alpha	60	73	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In addition, the incompletely penetrant postnatal mortality noted in the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice reported by Lin et al. could have resulted in a selection bias toward greater levels of compensatory responses in liver and other tissues in the surviving group.	"PGC - 1 alpha	73	86	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Lin et al. generated PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice by Cre recombinase - mediated excision of exons 3 - 5 in oocytes.	"PGC - 1 alpha	21	34	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice described here were generated by a targeting event that involved a 3 ' homologous recombination leading to an insertion of the targeting vector including an extra exon 3 between exons 5 and 6.	"PGC - 1 alpha	4	17	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In addition, we could not detect full - length or smaller PGC - 1 alpha proteins by Western blotting.	"PGC - 1 alpha	58	71	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the sensitivity of the immunoblotting was not high enough to pick up a small amount of mutant ( truncated) PGC - 1 alpha protein that could have some activity, given that it would contain nuclear receptor - interacting domains and the amino - terminal activation domain.	"PGC - 1 alpha	155	168	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 168, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
If small amounts of PGC - 1 alpha activity are present in the mice reported here, it could explain some of the observed differences between the models.	"PGC - 1 alpha	20	33	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In summary, this body of work provides evidence that PGC - l alpha is critical for the adaptive responses necessary to meet postnatal energy demands.

Our results also suggest a broader role for inducible transcriptional coactivators such as PGC - 1 alpha in transducing cellular signals triggered by physiologic and developmental cues to the transcriptional control of energy metabolism and other dynamic cellular processes.	"PGC - 1 alpha	91	104	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
"In this regard, the inducible coactivator PGC - 1 alpha serves as a transcriptional "" booster "" to augment the capacity of downstream metabolic pathways critical for metabolic maturation and postnatal growth."

Lastly, we propose that the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice should serve as a useful murine model to investigate the role of altered energy metabolism in obesity, diabetes, hepatic steatosis, and diseases of the heart, skeletal muscle, and central nervous system.

To verify the presence of endogenous Annexin A7 in nuclei, we used a biochemical approach and purified nuclei from neuro - 2a, PC - 12, and C6 cells and treated them with a hypotonic extraction buffer to obtain the nucleoplasm ( Fig. 7A).

Western blots probed with mAb 203 - 217 showed Annexin A7 in the nucleoplasm of neuronal ( neuro - 2a, PC - 12) and astroglial ( C6) cell lines ( Fig. 7A), however, the large isoform could only be clearly extracted with nucleoplasm from C6 cells.

But this staining largely disappears and at the following day E16 we detect Annexin A7 in the nucleus of cells in the intermediate and marginal zone of the neopallium.

These observations suggested that the subcellular localization of Annexin A7 depends on developmental stage and cell type.	"Annexin A7	66	76	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Annexin A7"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In the adult brain we generally observed a nuclear localization for Annexin A7 in neurons whereas astrocytes exhibited both a cytosolic as well as a nuclear staining.

In cultured cells after cell damage or apoptosis ( unpublished observations) or in cells treated with a Ca2 + - ionophore Annexin A7 translocated from the cytoplasm to cellular membranes [ 19].

We therefore favor the hypothesis that Annexin A7 in the sensitive neurons of the human autopsy brain may have similarly translocated to the cellular membrane.

Both Annexin A7 isoforms described in brain tissue seemingly are expressed by neurons and astrocytes, which was shown using total cell extracts of cultured neuo - 2a, PC - 12, and C6 cells.

In addition to their expression in brain, both Annexin A7 isoforms have only been described in heart muscle and red blood cells [ 5 - 8].	"Annexin A7	47	57	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Annexin A7"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Indeed, when we analyzed primary astrocytes from an AnxA7 - / - mouse for Ca2 + - dependent signaling processes, we found that they exhibited a significantly increased velocity of mechanically induced astrocytic Ca2 + - waves as compared to wild type [ 9].

The developing gray matter of the rat embryonic spinal cord exhibited primarily nuclear localization of Annexin A11, while immunoreactivity was lost from the nuclei in the adult spinal cord [ 26].

In contrast, our studies show a relocation of Annexin A7 from the cytosol to the nucleus in cells of the embryonic neuronal tissue.	"Annexin A7	46	56	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Annexin A7"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

An important one appears to be Ca2 +, which promotes binding of Annexin A7 to membranes and also allows aggregation of annexins [ 27].	"Annexin A7	64	74	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Annexin A7"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
These results mirror studies with stably transfected C6 cells, in which high intracellular Ca2 + - concentrations induced a marked redistribution of Annexin A7 from its localization in the nucleoplasm to the nuclear membrane [ 19].

Er81EWS - Pea3 / - mice did not differ from wild - type in the number of proprioceptive afferent cell bodies within the DRG of L1 to L5, the expression of several genes normally expressed by proprioceptive afferents, and the lack of expression of genes not normally expressed in proprioceptive afferents ( Figure S1; data not shown).

In contrast to wild - type proprioceptive afferent projections ( Figure 3A - 3C), GFP + sensory afferents in TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos failed to invade the spinal cord and instead were found in an extreme lateral position at the dorsal root entry zone, a phenotype observed at least up to E18. 5 ( Figure 3A - 3C and 3G - 3I; data not shown).

We next visualized the path of sensory afferent projections towards the dorsal root entry zone in TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos by injecting fluorescently labeled dextran into an individual DRG ( L3; n = 3; Figure 3M - 3Q).

Sensory afferents in TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos also bifurcated at the entry point, although approximately 5% of afferent fibers continued to grow towards the midline ( Figure 3O and 3Q).

While rostro - caudal projections were present in TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos, afferent fibers failed to approach the midline at distal segments and continued to occupy an extreme lateral position ( Figure 3O), consistent with the analysis of transverse sections.

While sensory axons in TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos reached the skin and established major nerve trunks by E16. 5, only rudimentary sensory axon branching was established within the skin ( Figure 3D and 3J).

Surprisingly, DRG neurons isolated from TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos and cultured without neurotrophic support survived after 48 h in vitro and had established long and highly branched neurites ( Figure 4D).

Together, these findings suggest that only precocious but not isochronic ETS signaling in DRG neurons is capable of uncoupling survival and neurite outgrowth from a requirement for neurotrophin signaling normally observed in wild - type DRG.

Surprisingly, we found that apoptosis was decreased by approximately 50% ( n = 3 embryos, average of > 50 sections) in DRG of TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos in comparison to wild - type ( Figure 6D, 6J, and 6M).

An even higher degree of Capn2 + / - over - representation was seen when the mutant allele came the mother ( 73%) compared to when it came from the father ( 59%).	"Capn2	25	30	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Capn2"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

This procedure has been extensively applied to targeted ES cells and was readily achieved in the case of Capn4 + / - ES cells [ 31].	"Capn4	105	110	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Capn4"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In this case, however, no Capn2 - / - ES cells were isolated in screens of 126 drug - resistant clones.	"Capn2	26	31	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Capn2"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This was first used to disrupt the Capn4 gene, encoding the small regulatory subunit common to both mu - and m - calpain.	"Capn4	35	40	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Capn4"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Two independent laboratories observed embryonic lethality in Capn4 knockout mice, albeit at different stages of development [ 31, 32].	"Capn4	61	66	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Capn4"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The survival of Capn4 - / - embryos from the original targeted line reported by Arthur and colleagues to mid - gestation is more difficult to reconcile [ 31].	"Capn4	16	21	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Capn4"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This strategy was based upon previous structure / function studies showing that excision of the C - terminal 25 amino acid residues of the small subunit abolished calpain activity when co - expressed with the m - calpain large subunit in E. coli [ 34].

In contrast, the Capn4 targeting strategy employed by Zimmerman and colleagues involved a much more extensive deletion of exons 4 through 8 [ 32].	"Capn4	17	22	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Capn4"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
It now seems probable that the difference in the time of lethality of these two targeted Capn4 lines can be explained by different extents of disruption.	"Capn4	89	94	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Capn4"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
A similar effect might be at work in the two Capn4 transgenic lines.	"Capn4	45	50	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Capn4"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Efforts were made to detect transcripts or calpain activities derived from the Arthur Capn4 allele.	"Capn4	86	91	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Capn4"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
These transcripts could give rise to defective calpain small subunits with 10 - 30 inappropriate C - terminal acids, which might be sufficient to support a low level of calpain activity.	"calpain small subunits	47	69	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""calpain small subunits"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The different timing of lethality in the Capn4 knockouts might also be a consequence of the different genetic backgrounds of the two transgenic lines, which has been observed to influence the phenotype of transgenic mice on a number of occasions [ 37].	"Capn4	41	46	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Capn4"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The principal phenotype observed as a result of Capn1 deficiency involved a disturbance in platelet function, possibly at the level of the tyrosine phosphorylation of certain proteins involved in platelet activation.	"Capn1	48	53	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Capn1"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
As a result, it is not possible to determine whether the absence of marked phenotype in Capn1 - / - animals is due to a compensatory affect by the remaining m - calpain activity, or whether the functions of mu - calpain are simply not essential.	"Capn1	88	93	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Capn1"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In contrast, lethality in Capn2 - / - embryos demonstrates that m - calpain activity is essential for embryonic development beyond the 8 - cell stage.	"Capn2	26	31	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Capn2"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The underlying cause of the preimplantation lethality in Capn2 - / - embryos has not yet been clarified.	"Capn2	57	62	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Capn2"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, the fact that only two out of 90 successfully genotyped pre - implantation embryos proved to be Capn2 - / - is in itself revealing.	"Capn2	105	110	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Capn2"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The Capn2 knockout fits into the latter category.	"Capn2	4	9	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Capn2"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
If it is true that m - calpain is essential for some aspect of cell viability, the survival of a few Capn2 - / - embryos to the 8 - cell stage is most likely due to the persistence of some maternal m - calpain mRNA and / or protein through 2 - 3 cell divisions.	"Capn2	101	106	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Capn2"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Defects in migration, reported in Capn4 - / - cells [ 9], could contribute to failed embryonic development.	"Capn4	34	39	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Capn4"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The association between calpain and cell viability has been noted in Capn4 - / - MEFs and other cell lines, although the reported work frequently did not distinguish between mu - and m - calpain, and did not show that calpain was strictly essential [ 5, 6].	"Capn4	69	74	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Capn4"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In both CHO cells and Capn4 - / - MEFs, calpain was shown to influence cell proliferation, but only at very low cell densities [ 5].	"Capn4	22	27	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Capn4"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
It should also be stressed that Capn4 - / - ES and MEF cells from the presumptive hypomorphic allele can be maintained in culture despite an apparent lack of calpain activity, as assessed by casein zymography or by the appearance of characteristic spectrin breakdown products.	"Capn4	32	37	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Capn4"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
It is conceivable, as discussed earlier, that a trace amount of calpain activity, beneath levels detectable by these methods, is retained from this mutant Capn4 allele, and it is sufficient for maintaining the viability of the cells.

Interestingly, heterozygous crosses involving the Capn4 transgenic line generated by Zimmerman and colleagues yielded progeny with a similar, if less extreme, skewing in favor of the heterozygous genotype.

While CNCC proliferation was not affected in Alk5 mutants ( data not shown), we could detect a dramatic increase in the number of TUNEL positive cells in tissues surrounding the aortic sac including the site where the AP - septum forms ( Fig. 7A - C).

These results were confirmed by using immunostaining for cleaved caspase - 3, another marker for apoptosis ( Fig. 7I, J).	"cleaved caspase - 3	57	76	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""cleaved caspase - 3"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In contrast, the thymic primordia of the Alk5 mutant littermates failed to descend caudally, and were located bilaterally in the neck region, where they were surrounded by neural crest - derived mesenchyme ( Fig. 8D, E).

During the last few years the Wnt1 - Cre transgenic driver line has proven to be a powerful tool for tissue - specific gene deletion in NCCs [ 12, 13, 27, 28].	"Wnt1	30	34	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Wnt1"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Using this approach, several studies have independently shown that the NC - specific deletion of the Tgfbr2 gene leads to a distinct set of calvarial, facial and cardiac defects [ 8, 9, 20, 29].	"Tgfbr2	101	107	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Tgfbr2"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Although relevant Gdfs 8, 9 11 and 15 are not expressed in the developing heart, nor do the mice deficient in these Gdfs display developmental cardiac defects, we cannot exclude the possibility that circulating GDFs, perhaps in concert with TGF - beta s may contribute to NCC survival during cardiac and pharyngeal morphogenesis.	"TGF - beta s	241	253	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""TGF - beta s"", ""start_span"": 241, ""end_span"": 253, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Several in vitro studies have suggested an indispensable role for TGF - beta - signaling in differentiation of NCCs into smooth muscle cells.	"TGF - beta	66	76	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""TGF - beta"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Moreover, it has been suggested that deletion of Tgfbr2 in NCCs leads to other phenotypic features reminiscent of those seen in the velocardiofacial / DiGeorge syndrome ( VCF / DGS) [ 9] caused by a deletion of the so called DiGeorge critical region ( DGCR) on chromosome 22q11 [ 34, 35].

However, it appears that these two TGF - beta / BMP type I receptors contribute to OFT rotation through different mechanisms.

In Alk5 mutants there is very little, if any, detectable septal mesenchyme present, and thus it could be argued that in these mutants OFT rotation fails due to a lack of penetration of septal prongs into the cushion mesenchyme.	"Alk5	3	7	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Alk5"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

BMPs have been implicated in early limb patterning as well as in the process of skeletogenesis.	"BMPs	0	4	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMPs"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, because different members of this group often have similar effects on target cells and are produced in overlapping regions of the embryo and hence can be redundant with one another, removal of any single member of the BMP family may not reveal the full extent of the roles they play during development.

Moreover, in the absence of these two BMP family members, there is a severe impairment in the development of bone tissue, resulting in severely deformed limbs.	"BMP	38	41	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

For example, during limb development, BMPs have been postulated to act sequentially in multiple distinct aspects of patterning, cell type specification, and differentiation of various tissues, particularly of the skeleton.

The earliest step of limb development in which BMP signaling has been implicated is the establishment of the anterior - posterior limb axis.	"BMP	47	50	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

Nonetheless, Bmp7 knockout mice do not show any defect in limb polarity.	"Bmp7	13	17	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Bmp7"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, a redundant function in anterior - posterior patterning with BMP2 remains a possibility.	"BMP2	70	74	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This, in turn, prevents BMPs from downregulating fibroblast growth factor ( FGF) production in the AER [ 17, 22] and maintains the integrity of the AER itself [ 23].	"BMPs	24	28	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMPs"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

At later stages of limb development, BMP activity is also believed to play critical roles in skeletogenesis.	"BMP	37	40	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Activation and dominant - negative experiments in the chick have shown that signaling through the BMPR - IB receptor is necessary and sufficient for cartilage condensation in chick [ 25].

The conditional alleles were deleted early in limb development through the action of a cre - recombinase transgene expressed under the control of the Prx1 enhancer [ 32].

As reported [ 16], in the absence of BMP4 activity, limbs display a variable penetrance of preaxial and postaxial polydactyly, but otherwise, normal digit patterns and apparently normal skeletal differentiation ( Figure 1G and 1O) take place.

As previously described, mice homozygous for a null mutation in Bmp7 [ 12] have no defects in the formation of the normal appendicular skeletal elements ( Figure 1H and 1P).

They also display the same scapular defects seen in Bmp2C / C; Prx1:: cre mice, and the overall size of the appendicular skeleton is slightly diminished.	"Prx1	63	67	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Prx1"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
As noted above, Bmp2 - deficient animals display a variably penetrant 3 / 4 soft tissue syndactyly phenotype ( Figure 2B).	"Bmp2	16	20	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Bmp2"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

However, one of the striking defects observed in the Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre mice is that in the newborn animals, the digits of both forelimb ( unpublished data) and hindlimb show complete syndactyly ( Figure 2D; compare to wild - type, Figure 2C).	"Prx1	75	79	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Prx1"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre limbs, only the very distal tips of each digit were separated, with the autopod adopting the shape of a notched pallet ( Figure 2F).

Interdigital apoptosis is dramatically reduced in the Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre limbs ( Figure 2F and 2H, arrow).	"Prx1	76	80	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Prx1"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
One of the phenotypes characterizing the Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre mutant is expansion of the AER ( see below).	"Prx1	63	67	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Prx1"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Moreover, in the Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre animals, the AER is maintained as late as E15. 5, long after it has started to degrade in wild - type limbs.	"Prx1	39	43	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Prx1"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This can be seen morphologically ( unpublished data) or by staining for expression of AER - specific marker such as Fgf8 ( Figure 2I and 2J).	"Fgf8	116	120	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Fgf8"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre mutant limbs at E15. 5 show strong acridine orange staining in the remnants of AER ( Figure 2H, asterisk), in domains of the distal tip where the AER remains the longest ( compare staining in Figure 2F and 2J).

BMP signaling has been proposed to play several distinct roles in limb patterning.	"BMP	0	3	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
SHH signaling itself extends over a long range in the developing limb bud, based on both activation of target genes [ 36] and protein distribution [ 37].	"SHH	0	3	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""SHH"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
By E11. 5, the Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre limb buds are noticeably broader, expanded in the posterior relative to wild - type.	"Prx1	37	41	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Prx1"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The expansion of the AER in the absence of BMP signaling may be understood on the basis of the feedback loop between the zone of polarizing activity ( ZPA) and the AER.	"BMP	43	46	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, a decrease in BMP signaling expands and maintains the AER.	"BMP	20	23	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In wild - type limb buds the condensation of all five digits can be visualized at this stage by in situ hybridization with a probe directed against Sox9, the earliest known chondrogenic marker ( Figure 3I).

Msx2 is normally expressed in the non - chondrogenic interdigital mesenchyme at this stage ( Figure 3M), a continuation of an earlier expression domain throughout the distal mesenchyme.

The loss of the posterior forelimb digits in these mice thus does not appear to represent a decrease in polarizing activity leading to a change in digit identity rather a consequence of the overall level of BMP signaling falling below a threshold for initiating chondrogenesis in the posterior of these forelimbs.	"BMP	207	210	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 207, ""end_span"": 210, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The posterior of the hindlimb in the mutant, in contrast, appears to remain above this threshold, and more than five digit condensations form in the hindlimb bud ( Figures 3K and 1S) and no ectopic expression of Msx2 is observed in the posterior ( Figure 3O).

The inability to complete osteoblast differentiation in the Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre mice results in strikingly defective limb morphology at 1 wk of age ( compare Figure S3G and S3H).

It has been proposed that BMP signaling may be involved in digit patterning as a secondary signal originating in the ZPA [ 7, 11, 43] or as a later mediator of interdigital patterning information [ 15].	"BMP	26	29	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, inactivation of Bmp2 during early limb bud development clearly does not cause any digit patterning defects.	"Bmp2	25	29	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Bmp2"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
BMPs are known, in many cases, to function redundantly [ 44].	"BMPs	0	4	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMPs"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Our data implicate BMP signaling in this process.	"BMP	19	22	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
At later stages, BMP signaling has been suggested to play a role in mediating the transfer of positional information from the interdigital mesenchyme to specify the identity of the adjacent digits [ 15].	"BMP	17	20	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Decreasing the level of interdigital BMP signaling, without abolishing it, provides an opportunity for differentiating between these models.	"BMP	37	40	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
If BMP signaling were only required as a permissive factor for chondrogenesis, partial reduction in the level of signaling might have no effect.	"BMP	3	6	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 6, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
It should be noted that the interdigital expression domains form several days after recombination of the floxed BMP alleles is complete.	"BMP	112	115	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, we conclude that BMP signaling is not likely to be responsible in a quantitative fashion for the instructive role of interdigital mesenchyme in establishing digit identities.	"BMP	23	26	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
It is also possible that the difference in severity relates to the time required to recombine one as opposed to two floxed alleles; however, we do not favor this explanation as all detectable BMP4 expression is lost prior to any morphological differences between the mutant and wild - type limb buds.

We also examined three epigenetic signatures of PMSC: histone H3 dimethylated or trimethylated at lysine - 9 ( H3 - 2meK9, H3 - 3meK9) and spreading of HP1 beta through the XY body [ 16, 57, 58] ( S.

Similarly, we found Dmrt7 mutant diplotene cells lacking accumulation of H3 - 2meK9 and H3 - 3meK9 marks onto the sex chromatin ( Figure 8I - 8L).	"Dmrt7	20	25	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Dmrt7"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In one experiment, 11 / 27 mutant cells in diplonema lacked HP1 beta on the XY body, as compared with 2 / 22 wild - type cells.	"HP1 beta	60	68	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""HP1 beta"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We hypothesize that the mutant cells with normal HP1 beta may be those that can complete meiosis ( Figures 4 and 5).	"HP1 beta	49	57	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""HP1 beta"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Because this process could be abnormal in the mutant cells, we also staged mutant cells by chromosome morphology using an antibody to SYCP3 ( Figure 9).	"SYCP3	134	139	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""SYCP3"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
From these results, we conclude that Dmrt7 mutant cells establish a normal XY body in mid - pachynema, but then have multiple epigenetic defects in the sex chromatin transition from pachynema to diplonema.

In this study, we find that the DM domain protein DMRT7 is required for male germ cells to complete meiotic prophase but is dispensable in the female germ line.	"DMRT7	50	55	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""DMRT7"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In males, DMRT7 expression is highest in pachytene spermatocytes, and the protein preferentially localizes to the XY body.	"DMRT7	10	15	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""DMRT7"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Since the arrest and apoptosis of Dmrt7 mutant spermatocytes could result from perturbation of any of the critical pachytene events mentioned above, we tested whether they occur abnormally in the mutant cells.	"Dmrt7	34	39	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Dmrt7"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We found that chromosomal synapsis and recombination appear normal in Dmrt7 mutant cells.	"Dmrt7	70	75	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Dmrt7"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We therefore focused on the XY body, the most prominent site of DMRT7 accumulation.	"DMRT7	64	69	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""DMRT7"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
First, we tested whether the XY body forms and MSCI is established in Dmrt7 mutant cells.	"Dmrt7	70	75	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Dmrt7"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Moreover, Cot - 1 hybridization and analysis of RBMY expression demonstrated that MSCI initiates normally in the XY body of mid - pachytene Dmrt7 mutant cells.	"Dmrt7	140	145	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Dmrt7"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We did, however, observe three specific defects in the sex chromatin of Dmrt7 mutant germ cells that avoided arrest in pachynema and were able to enter diplonema.	"Dmrt7	72	77	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Dmrt7"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Normally cells accumulate H3 - 2meK9 and H3 - 3meK9 marks and HP1 beta protein on the sex chromatin as they progress to diplonema, but we observed mutant diplotene cells lacking these features.	"HP1 beta	62	70	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""HP1 beta"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, although a minority of Dmrt7 mutant germ cells can progress from pachynema to diplonema, there are defects in sex chromatin modification during the transition.	"Dmrt7	29	34	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Dmrt7"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
A function in male sex chromatin can reconcile the findings that DMRT7 is required for meiosis, but only in males, and is present only in mammals.	"DMRT7	65	70	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""DMRT7"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Because most Dmrt7 mutant germ cells are eliminated by apoptosis around the time at which we observed sex chromatin defects, a simple model is that the apoptosis is a consequence of the sex chromatin defects.	"Dmrt7	13	18	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Dmrt7"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Alternatively, apoptosis and abnormal sex chromatin may be two independent consequences of Dmrt7 loss.	"Dmrt7	91	96	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Dmrt7"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

A number of other proteins have been identified that interact with the XY body, including histone variants and modified histones, a testis - specific histone methyl transferase, chromobox proteins, an orphan receptor germ - cell nuclear factor, and recombination - related proteins [ 60].	"germ - cell nuclear factor	217	243	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""germ - cell nuclear factor"", ""start_span"": 217, ""end_span"": 243, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
DMRT7 is unusual among XY body proteins in being related to highly site - specific transcriptional regulators.	"DMRT7	0	5	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""DMRT7"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
An attractive speculation is that DMRT7 may provide sequence specificity in recruiting other proteins, such as chromatin modifiers, to the XY body as part of the transition to PMSC.	"DMRT7	34	39	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""DMRT7"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The finding that Dmrt7 is essential for mammalian meiosis expands the known functions of this gene family.	"Dmrt7	17	22	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Dmrt7"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Dmrt1 is required in pre - meiotic male germ cells for differentiation of gonocytes into spermatogonia, as well as in Sertoli cells, but it is not expressed in meiotic cells [ 31] ( S. Kim and D. Zarkower, unpublished data).	"Dmrt1	0	5	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Dmrt1"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Ovaries of Dmrt4 mutant females have polyovular follicles ( follicles containing multiple oocytes), but it is unknown whether this reflects a defect in the germ line or the soma.	"Dmrt4	11	16	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Dmrt4"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, no close Dmrt7 ortholog has been reported in nonmammalian vertebrates, and our database searches did not reveal one.	"Dmrt7	18	23	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Dmrt7"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, Dmrt7 likely arose, presumably by duplication and divergence of another Dmrt gene, shortly before or coincident with the mammalian radiation.	"Dmrt7	6	11	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Dmrt7"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The presence of Dmrt7 in both lineages may support a common origin for either the sex chromosomes or the sex chromatin of monotremes and other mammals.	"Dmrt7	16	21	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Dmrt7"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
A plausible model is that Dmrt7 evolved during the establishment of mammalian sex determination to help cope with ancestral differences in gene dosage, chromosome pairing, recombination, or other meiotic issues arising from sex chromosome heteromorphy.	"Dmrt7	26	31	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Dmrt7"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In this regard, we speculate that the recruitment of Dmrt7 during mammalian evolution may be analogous to the recruitment of chromatin regulatory complexes to achieve somatic dosage compensation during evolution of heteromorphic sex chromosomes in several phyla ( reviewed in [ 62]).

In summary, we have found that the mammal - specific DM domain protein DMRT7 is essential for meiotic prophase progression in males.	"DMRT7	71	76	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""DMRT7"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

Thus, mutational analysis of mouse Pch2 ( Trip13), which is also critical for the synapsis checkpoint in C. elegans [ 2], was the best remaining option to evaluate potential functional conservation in mammalian meiotic checkpoint control.

One possibility for TRIP13 ' s role in recombination is that it is directly involved in a step specific to resolution of NCO recombination intermediates.	"TRIP13	20	26	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""TRIP13"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

Regarding the cause of cell death in Trip13 mutants, our data indicate that this is triggered by defective DSB repair rather than asynapsis.	"Trip13	37	43	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Trip13"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

It is possible that the nascent induction of DSBs in pachynema evokes a checkpoint response that cannot be bypassed by OA, whereas the post - strand invasion lesions in TRIP13 - deficient spermatocytes do not.

As alluded to earlier, a complicating problem for studying potential meiotic checkpoint genes in mice is that as in yeast, such genes often have mitotic functions ( such as RAD24 [ 7]), and their ablation can cause lethality [ 42].
