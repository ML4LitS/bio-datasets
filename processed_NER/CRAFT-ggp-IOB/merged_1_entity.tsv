The different lines examined, however, are very likely to differ genetically from CAPAN - 1 cells not only at the BRCA2 locus, but also at a very large number of additional loci.

While Moynahan et al were careful to point out this problem, two sets of results argue against the possibility that the recombinational repair deficiency of CAPAN - 1 cells is completely independent of its defect in BRCA2.

Furthermore, the discrepancy between the 100 - fold difference between CAPAN - 1 and the other human lines as compared with the fivefold to sixfold difference between the Brca2lex1 / lex2cells and Brca2 + / + ES cells might simply be accounted for by the fact that Brca2lex1 / lex2 is not a null allele.

It had been shown previously that the small amount of truncated BRCA2 protein expressed by CAPAN - 1 cells was mislocalized to the cytoplasm, consistent with the fact that the truncation protein lacks a nuclear localization signal [ 28].

This strategy was based upon previous structure / function studies showing that excision of the C - terminal 25 amino acid residues of the small subunit abolished calpain activity when co - expressed with the m - calpain large subunit in E. coli [ 34].	m - calpain large subunit,209,234,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""m - calpain large subunit"", ""start_span"": 209, ""end_span"": 234, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	train

The different timing of lethality in the Capn4 knockouts might also be a consequence of the different genetic backgrounds of the two transgenic lines, which has been observed to influence the phenotype of transgenic mice on a number of occasions [ 37].

As a result, it is not possible to determine whether the absence of marked phenotype in Capn1 - / - animals is due to a compensatory affect by the remaining m - calpain activity, or whether the functions of mu - calpain are simply not essential.

If it is true that m - calpain is essential for some aspect of cell viability, the survival of a few Capn2 - / - embryos to the 8 - cell stage is most likely due to the persistence of some maternal m - calpain mRNA and / or protein through 2 - 3 cell divisions.

The association between calpain and cell viability has been noted in Capn4 - / - MEFs and other cell lines, although the reported work frequently did not distinguish between mu - and m - calpain, and did not show that calpain was strictly essential [ 5, 6].

It should also be stressed that Capn4 - / - ES and MEF cells from the presumptive hypomorphic allele can be maintained in culture despite an apparent lack of calpain activity, as assessed by casein zymography or by the appearance of characteristic spectrin breakdown products.

Moreover, in the Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre animals, the AER is maintained as late as E15. 5, long after it has started to degrade in wild - type limbs.	Prx1,39,43,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""Prx1"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	train

The expansion of the AER in the absence of BMP signaling may be understood on the basis of the feedback loop between the zone of polarizing activity ( ZPA) and the AER.

In wild - type limb buds the condensation of all five digits can be visualized at this stage by in situ hybridization with a probe directed against Sox9, the earliest known chondrogenic marker ( Figure 3I).

The loss of the posterior forelimb digits in these mice thus does not appear to represent a decrease in polarizing activity leading to a change in digit identity rather a consequence of the overall level of BMP signaling falling below a threshold for initiating chondrogenesis in the posterior of these forelimbs.

It has been proposed that BMP signaling may be involved in digit patterning as a secondary signal originating in the ZPA [ 7, 11, 43] or as a later mediator of interdigital patterning information [ 15].

However, inactivation of Bmp2 during early limb bud development clearly does not cause any digit patterning defects.	Bmp2,25,29,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""Bmp2"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	train
BMPs are known, in many cases, to function redundantly [ 44].	BMPs,0,4,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""BMPs"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	train
Our data implicate BMP signaling in this process.	BMP,19,22,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	train
At later stages, BMP signaling has been suggested to play a role in mediating the transfer of positional information from the interdigital mesenchyme to specify the identity of the adjacent digits [ 15].

Decreasing the level of interdigital BMP signaling, without abolishing it, provides an opportunity for differentiating between these models.	BMP,37,40,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	train
If BMP signaling were only required as a permissive factor for chondrogenesis, partial reduction in the level of signaling might have no effect.	BMP,3,6,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 6, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	train
It should be noted that the interdigital expression domains form several days after recombination of the floxed BMP alleles is complete.	BMP,112,115,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	train
Thus, we conclude that BMP signaling is not likely to be responsible in a quantitative fashion for the instructive role of interdigital mesenchyme in establishing digit identities.

It is also possible that the difference in severity relates to the time required to recombine one as opposed to two floxed alleles; however, we do not favor this explanation as all detectable BMP4 expression is lost prior to any morphological differences between the mutant and wild - type limb buds.

Because most Dmrt7 mutant germ cells are eliminated by apoptosis around the time at which we observed sex chromatin defects, a simple model is that the apoptosis is a consequence of the sex chromatin defects.

For example, while the expanded domain of Agouti expression in postnatal deH / deH animals can be traced to events that occur between E11. 5 and E13. 5, the underlying cause may be that embryonic cells in dorsolateral mesenchyme acquire a ventral rather than dorsal identity or that those cells fail to proliferate normally, followed by compensatory expansion of ventral cells.

Although genes showing type I derepression demonstrated staining in the majority of cells in the ONL, two lines of evidence suggest that these genes are not completely derepressed in these cells when compared to their expression in S - opsin - expressing cones.

First, close evaluation of the staining pattern of a number of type I genes in the rd7 mutant retina ( e. g., see Table S1, genes G9, G19, and G24), reveals that, in addition to the background staining throughout the ONL, there is a more darkly staining subpopulation of cells scattered throughout this layer in a distribution corresponding to that of the supernumerary S - cone opsin - expressing cells.

The factor ( s) controlling these differences are unknown, but may be intrinsic, as cocultures of older and younger retinas, conditioned media from older retinas, and addition of a variety of small molecules were unable to promote the expression of M - opsin in the P0 - initiated cultures [ 32].

The discovery of highly conserved CLN2 - like enzymes not only in mammals but also in two fish species and one of frogs may indicate that these peptidases are universally present in the vertebrates, and that their important role identified in humans [ 2] and mice [ 14] might be a more general feature.

That this bond likely occurs in the real protein is suggested by the fact that these two cysteines are strictly conserved in all known animal species of CLN2 ( Figures 1 and 3), although they are absent in all known sequences of bacterial sedolisins.

Consistent with this explanation, we found that the 129 mice have significantly higher levels of Apcs in circulation compared with the C57BL / 6 mice ( median, 83 mg / l; range, 25 - 208; n = 16 versus median, 5 mg / l; range, 4 - 9; n = 10, respectively; p < 0. 0001).

In contrast to these strong associations with disease serological markers, the QTL analysis identified only two potential linkages to glomerulonephritis: one in the wild - type mice on Chromosome 7 across a 10 cM region between D7Mit246 ( 15 cM) and D7Mit145 ( 26. 5 cM) of 129 origin ( LOD 2. 86, p = 0. 0013), and one on Chromosome 17 between D17Mit100 ( 11. 7 cM) and D17Mit216 ( 29. 4 cM) from the C57BL / 6 strain ( LOD 1. 3, p = 0. 049 and LOD 1. 67, p = 0. 021 in the wild - type and Apcs - / - mice, respectively).

Thus, the congenic line carried a similar 129 region ( 80 - 106 cM) to the one present in the C57BL / 6. Apcs - / - mice ( 87. 9 - 105 cM).	Apcs,105,109,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""Apcs"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	test

However, the C57BL / 6. 129 ( D1Mit105 - 223) animals also expressed high levels of auto - Abs, and these titres were not different from those detected in the matched congenic mice containing a null mutation of the Apcs gene.

On the basis of these observations, it was postulated that Apcs, by altering the clearance of chromatin, contributes to the pathogenesis of SLE.	Apcs,59,63,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""Apcs"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	test
However, in this study we found that only ANA and anti - chromatin Ab levels were significantly increased in the ( 129 x C57BL / 6) F2. Apcs - / - mice.	Apcs,136,140,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""Apcs"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	test
A possible explanation for this discrepancy may lie in the fact that the Apcs - / - mice analysed in the original study were generated from a limited number of founders and that this may have caused a nonrandom inheritance of the loci from the parental strains.	Apcs,73,77,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""Apcs"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	test

In agreement with this, when we carried out a selective comparison between the ( 129 x C57BL / 6) F2. Apcs - / - mice and Chromosome 1 genetically matched controls, we failed to detect any significant difference in the levels of these two auto - Abs.

These findings, taken together, indicated that the phenotype associated with Apcs deficiency was caused by the presence of unaltered 129 genes from the telomeric region of Chromosome 1 operating in the C57BL / 6 genomic background.	Apcs,77,81,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""Apcs"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	test

The expression of anti - nuclear autoimmunity was identical comparing the congenic with the Apcs - / - mice.	Apcs,92,96,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""Apcs"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	test

However, as the congenic mice and the Apcs - / - mice carried similar but not identical 129 regions on Chromosome 1, an alternative explanation for our findings may still lay in the numerous and complex synergistic and counteractive interactions between 129 and C57BL / 6 genes involved in self - tolerance and end organ damage.

Thus, whilst the lack of lupus nephritis in the congenic mice is consistent with the need for multiple susceptibility genes for the full expression of lupus, further studies will be required to fully elucidate the role of Apcs in the pathogenesis of renal damage.

At day E16. 5, however, retinal layers in Ptdsr - / - embryos were much thinner than in wild - type embryos, contained fewer cells and were greatly reduced in size ( Figure 4b, f).

Close examination of retinal structures revealed that the inner granular layer was still less expanded in Ptdsr - deficient animals, however, and that it contained fewer cells and was still severely underdeveloped in comparison with the corresponding retinal layer in control animals ( Figure 4c, 4g and 4d, 4h).

In summary, our analysis in vivo did not reveal any impairment in apoptotic cell clearance in Ptdsr - deficient embryos during development and further suggests that phagocytosis of apoptotic cells is mainly mediated by non - professional ' bystander ' cells.

To determine whether macrophages from Ptdsr - knockout mice were impaired in the efficacy of apoptotic cell uptake in vitro, we performed phagocytosis assays with fetal - liver - derived macrophages ( FLDMs) and quantified their phagocytosis rates.

To re - examine and further independently validate the result of normal apoptotic cell uptake by Ptdsr - / - macrophages, we performed phagocytosis assays for 60 min and determined the percentage of macrophages that had engulfed apoptotic cells, in a total of at least 300 macrophages counted by fluorescence microscopy.

Phagocytosed, 5 - carboxytetramethylrhodamine - ( TAMRA -) labeled apoptotic cells were identified as being engulfed by inclusion in F4 / 80 - labeled macrophages.

Moreover, single Ptdsr - / - macrophages could be identified that had engulfed even more apoptotic target cells than had wild - type macrophages ( Figure 7b, d).	Ptdsr,17,22,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	test
Thus, Ptdsr - deficient macrophages had a normal ability to ingest apoptotic cells and were not impaired in recognition or phagocytosis of cells that had undergone programmed cell death.

In addition to its suggested importance for phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, it has been proposed that Ptdsr fulfils a second crucial role in regulating and maintaining a non - inflammatory environment upon the recognition of apoptotic cells by macrophages [ 26].

As recognition of phosphatidylserine is thought to be a universal engulfment mechanism for all cells that are able to phagocytose apoptotic cells, it is very striking that apoptotic cell clearance mediated by non - professional bystander cells is also not compromised by Ptdsr - deficiency.

We do not think that the different results observed in Ptdsr - knockout mice in a mixed C57BL / 6 x 129 background and in a pure C57BL / 6J background can be attributed to genetic background effects: comparison of apoptotic cell engulfment efficacies of thioglycollate - elicited macrophages from 129P2 / OlaHsd and C57BL / 6J mice did not show any differences in apoptotic cell uptake ( J.

However, earlier findings of normal proprioceptive afferent trajectories in chicken embryos despite injection of function - blocking NT - 3 antibody into the spinal cord ( Oakley et al. 1995) led them to discount this possibility.

While the phenotype of Er81 KO mice is quite dramatic, and most proprioceptive axons stop within the intermediate spinal cord, it is important to note that a few axons still find their way to the ventral spinal cord and target properly to the motor neurons ( Arber et al. 2000).

Our previous studies have shown that the sequences containing periodic ( dT) n tracts derived from the human lamin B2 origin ( 48% thymine content) can serve as an efficient activator for the Mcm helicase on a bubble, and replacement of thymines with guanines abolished the helicase activation ( 13, 28).	human lamin B2,103,117,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""human lamin B2"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	test

The ability of Mcm4 / 6 / 7 to unwind the bubble substrate but not the conventional duplex DNA ( Figures 2 and 13) indicates that Mcm can be loaded through the single - stranded segment of the bubble.

The archaeal Mcm can unwind A - fork [ 3 '] but eukaryotic Mcm4 / 6 / 7 cannot, since the former binds to double - stranded DNA but the latter does not ( 5, 27).	Mcm4,59,63,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""Mcm4"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	test

Occurrence of AT - rich sequences, with asymmetric distribution of adenine and thymine, near the replication origins, lead us to propose that Mcm may play a role in selection of initiation sites of mammalian DNA replication, and prompted us to examine the ability of sequences from human replication origins to activate Mcm4 / 6 / 7 helicase.

Thus, we have concluded that Mcm4 / 6 / 7 helicase is most efficiently activated by non - structured single - stranded DNA with thymine content of 50% or more, although significant stimulation is observed also by DNA with less thymine content ( Figure 7), suggesting that the sequence specificity for Mcm helicase activation is rather relaxed and that the extent of the activation may depend on the sequence context.

Replacement of the central guanosine with inosine in the CGG repeat duplex DNA resulted in displacement ( Figure 8E) ( 31), suggesting that the continuous presence of AT base pair may not be essential for the Mcm helicase function and that the thermostability of GC base pairs is inhibitory for helicase action of Mcm4 / 6 / 7.

Given that neuronal circuits underlying odor discrimination, as well as olfactory memory, rely on properties of fast excitatory neurotransmission mediated by alpha - amino - 3 - hydroxy - 5 - methyl - 4 - isoxazolepropionate receptors ( AMPARs), we sought to alter, by genetic means, the specific functional contribution of alpha - amino - 3 - hydroxy - 5 - methyl - 4 - isoxazolepropionate ( AMPA) channels containing the dominant subunit GluR - B.

Concerning this intended switch in AMPAR properties, mice lacking all GluR - B, however, show a widespread impairment in behavior, including lethargy, motor coordination problems, and deficits in exploratory activity [ 51], which preclude detailed behavioral analyses.

Similarly, mice expressing ( in the entire brain) a substantial part of the GluR - B population in the Q / R site - unedited form become seizure - prone and die prematurely [ 53].

Some of these problems can be partially overcome by use of spatially and temporally restricted expression systems [ 54 - 56], in particular the Cre - lox system, with Cre - recombinase expression in defined brain areas of gene - targeted mice carrying GluR - B alleles marked by loxP sites for Cre - mediated recombination [ 55, 57].

As activity, measured by the intertrial interval, was not significantly different between genotypes ( F ( 1, 16) = 3. 1; p = 0. 1), and analysis of the lick frequency showed a tendency to reduced motivation of GluR - B Delta FB mice in this particular task ( F ( 1, 16) = 9. 2; p < 0. 01), we conclude that depletion of GluR - B in forebrain areas indeed resulted in increased olfactory learning and discrimination performances, rather than motivational alterations.

To quantify the relation between residual GluR - B protein and olfactory memory, the memory experiment was repeated with nine additional GluR - B Delta FB mice and two GluR - B2lox control animals ( indicated with shaded symbols in Figure 4A), resulting in the same mean, variability, and range of memory performance ( control: 89 +/- 10%; GluR - B Delta FB: 63 +/- 14%).

Whereas no learning or discrimination - related parameter correlated with residual protein levels ( Figure 4D, R2 < 0. 3), a strong correlation between memory and GluR - B protein was observed in hippocampus ( Figure 4D, R2 = 0. 72, p < 0. 003, n = 10) and cortical areas ( Figure 4D, R2 = 0. 62, p < 0. 006, n = 10).

Thus, although both are mediated by alterations in the AMPAR subunit GluR - B, due to the qualitatively different dose - response curves, the phenotypes regarding olfactory memory, and olfactory learning / discrimination must be mechanistically distinct.

To obtain independent evidence for this spatial and mechanistic dissection of the roles of Ca2 + - permeable AMPARs, we expressed by transgenic means N - terminally green fluorescent protein ( GFP) - tagged GluR - B specifically in hippocampus and piriform cortex of GluR - B Delta FB mice ( Figure 5A and 5B).

The transgenic expression level of GFPGluR - B was 9. 72% +/- 1. 25 ( n = 3) in the hippocampus, compared with endogenous GluR - B ( Figure 5C and 5D).	GluR - B,38,46,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	test
In the olfactory memory experiments with GluR - B Delta FB animals, olfactory memory linearly depended on GluR - B expression in cortex and hippocampus with a slope of 9. 1 +/- 2. 5% ( cortex) and 8. 9 +/- 2. 0% ( hippocampus) increase in memory per 10% increase in protein ( Figure 4D).

A 9. 7% increase in GluR - B in these brain regions, as achieved by GluR - BRescue animals ( Figure 5), is thus predicted to increase olfactory memory by approximately 9% throughout the heterogeneous population ( blue line in Figure 6B).

Furthermore, increased performance even after long stretches of training and, in particular, increased sampling pattern differences ( TB and ATS, unpublished data) supported the notion that GluR - B depletion resulted in enhanced odor discrimination capability.	GluR - B,190,198,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 190, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	test
This notion will be further tested in mice with piriform cortex - specific GluR - B ablation.	GluR - B,75,83,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	test
AMPAR currents are reduced in mice not expressing GluR - B [ 51], possibly due to fewer synaptic AMPA channels and impaired AMPAR trafficking and recycling.

The milder phenotype upon GluR - B depletion could be attributed to reduced AMPAR densities at synapses [ 40, 41] and therefore probably to a lesser extent of Ca2 + influx.	GluR - B,26,34,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	test
Normally, GluR - B - containing AMPARs are prominently localized at the dendrodendritic synapse between mitral and granule cells in the olfactory bulb [ 64, 65].

Notably, the improved olfactory discrimination capabilities were apparent even upon relatively small reductions in GluR - B levels.	GluR - B,115,123,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	test
Finally, in other memory - related tasks, such as a hippocampus - dependent spatial reference memory task ( Figure S2), mice with GluR - B depletion were not impaired after task acquisition.	GluR - B,130,138,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	test
We therefore conclude that forebrain - specific ablation of GluR - B results in a specific loss of long - term olfactory memory but, at the same time, in enhanced odor discrimination and learning capabilities.

Therefore, residual GluR - B levels were determined from each mouse that had been tested in the behavioral experiments, and levels were correlated with odor learning, discrimination, and olfactory memory.

The significant direct correlation between residual GluR - B levels in hippocampus and cortical areas with olfactory memory suggested hippocampal and / or cortical neurons as putative mediators for odor memorization and / or storage.

This is furthermore consistent with a prominent role of cortical areas or hippocampus in olfactory memory, although GluR - B levels in the olfactory bulb were also weakly correlated with memory performance.	GluR - B,116,124,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	test
Transgenic expression of GFPGluR - B in piriform cortex and hippocampus indeed rescued memory to an extent strikingly consistent with the transgenic protein levels ( approximately 10% of wild - type GluR - B), confirming the reliability of the correlation analysis and the sensitivity of the behavioral assay.

What could be the cellular basis of the long - term memory deficit brought about by lack of GluR - B - containing AMPARs?	GluR - B,92,100,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	test
For complete GluR - B knockouts, increased long - term plasticity ( LTP) was reported in hippocampal field recordings [ 51].	GluR - B,13,21,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	test
In addition, in hippocampal and amygdala pathways lacking GluR - B, an AMPAR - dependent, N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA) receptor - independent form of LTP can be readily induced [ 51, 52].

Mechanistically, this is likely to be due to Ca2 + influx through GluR - B - less AMPA channels leading to non - hebbian forms of plasticity.	GluR - B,66,74,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	test
A critical step in discerning the discrimination and learning phenotypes from the memory phenotype was the observation of increased variability in the memory of the GluR - B knockout animals and, subsequently, the individual analyses of protein expression levels.	GluR - B,165,173,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	test
We made use of the epigenetic variability in GluR - B excision that could be correlated to the variability in memory but showed no correlation to variability in discrimination.

We could thus provide evidence for opposing roles of specific GluR - B manipulation and increased Ca2 + influx via AMPARs in olfactory discrimination / learning, and memory, potentially in the olfactory bulb and piriform cortex, respectively.

At the latest treatment interval analyzed by ELISA, animals administered dox for 6 mo showed elevated levels of PBS - soluble A beta ( see Figure 5) that could be interpreted as an indication that the plaques are slowly releasing peptide ( or oligomeric A beta) into the soluble pool and might eventually dissolve.

Somewhat paradoxically, several studies further demonstrate that treatment with anti - inflammatory drugs to reduce microglial activation actually lowers amyloid load in APP transgenic mice, suggesting a role for mouse microglia in the formation and maintenance of amyloid aggregates [ 41 - 43].

Nonetheless, the role of microglia in both the human condition and the mouse models is poorly understood, and differences in microglial reactivity between the two could lead to significantly faster amyloid clearance in the brains of patients with AD than we observe in the tet - off APP mice.

In p150CAF - 1 mutant 16 - cell stage embryos, the altered organization of heterochromatin displays similarities to the structure of heterochromatin in two - to four - cell stage wild - type embryos, suggesting that CAF - 1 is required for the maturation of heterochromatin during preimplantation development.	p150CAF - 1,3,14,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	test

These alterations of heterochromatin are not found in p150CAF - 1 - depleted mouse embryonic fibroblasts, which are cells that are already lineage committed, suggesting that CAF - 1 is specifically required for heterochromatin organization in pluripotent embryonic cells.	p150CAF - 1,54,65,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	test
Specifically, CAF - 1 deposits the histone H3 variant H3. 1 into chromatin, in a pathway coupled to DNA synthesis, whereas a second histone chaperone, HIRA, is involved in the deposition of the H3. 3 variant in a DNA synthesis independent pathway [ 11, 12].

Given the early developmental arrest observed in Chaf1a - / - embryos, such cells could not be derived directly from null embryos, and we thus used an RNAi strategy ( Figure 2A).

Surprisingly, we did not observe this severe alteration in heterochromatin organization in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs) following p150CAF - 1 depletion by RNAi.	p150CAF - 1,145,156,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	test
p150CAF - 1 depletion in MEFs resulted in a strong inhibition of cell proliferation ( unpublished data), but did not alter the clustering of heterochromatin domains ( Figures 2C and S2).	p150CAF - 1,0,11,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	test

Altogether, our data demonstrate that loss of p150CAF - 1 function in ES cells and early embryos alters first the organization of heterochromatin in the nucleus and, in a subsequent step, cell cycle and viability.	p150CAF - 1,46,57,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	test

Quantification of fluorescence along a line randomly drawn across the nucleus revealed lower fluorescence intensity and a broader distribution of DAPI and major satellite hybridization signals in p150CAF - 1 - depleted cells ( Figure 4C and 4D), indicating decondensation of pericentric heterochromatin domains.	p150CAF - 1,196,207,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 196, ""end_span"": 207, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	test
