Like BMP7, it is expressed in both the anterior and posterior margins of the limb bud mesenchyme [ 4, 14]; however, it does not appear to be induced by SHH signaling, nor does its expression change in SHH - deficient limb buds.

As noted above, BMP7 - deficient embryos produce mostly normal limbs, and mice harboring a conditional deletion of Bmp4 in the limb bud mesenchyme also do not show evidence of anterior digit transformation [ 16], as would have been predicted if BMP4 acted as an interdigital regulator of digit morphology.

To conditionally inactivate Bmp2 and Bmp4 in the limb, we used a well - characterized transgene in which cre - recombinase is expressed under the control of the Prx1 limb enhancer [ 32].

Nonetheless, some models have suggested that the patterning effect of this morphogenic signal is mediated entirely [ 10] or in part [ 11] by BMP2 and BMP7 produced as secondary signals in response to SHH.

The lack of transformations in digit identity in the limb skeletons formed in the absence of BMP2 and BMP7 activity also argues against BMP signaling being the critical instructive signal from the interdigital mesenchyme to the forming digits.

While vascularization occurs in Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre forelimbs, few osteoclasts are recruited to the mineralized cartilage ( compare Figure 5G and Figure 5H, red arrows), resulting in a delay in bone marrow cavity formation in the absence of BMP2 and BMP4.

In particular, BMP2, a secreted factor that is induced by SHH [ 8] in the posterior limb bud, has been suggested to act as a true morphogen secondary to SHH signaling to properly pattern the limb digits.

However, increasing BMP concentrations interdigitally with exogenous protein does not result in the reciprocal posterior transformations, and the noggin experiments can also be interpreted simply as a block in the condensation of the primordia of distal phalanges when BMP activity is completely abolished [ 38].

However, in the Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre forelimbs, there is a complete loss of posterior digit ray condensations, presumably because the total level of BMP signaling falls below the threshold for initiation of condensation, as previously seen in cases where BMP antagonists have been used [ 27, 28].

The photopic response in E2f1 KO mice was slightly reduced relative to WT ( Figure S5B), possibly because E2f1 is required for maximal expansion of embryonic RPCs, and the E2f1 KO retina has, as noted earlier, slightly fewer cells than the WT retina, although cell type proportions are unaffected ( D.

Indeed, this minor defect was rescued in the Rb / E2f1 / E2f3 triple knockout retina, where bipolar and ganglion cell death was rescued and SAC differentiation was restored ( Figure 4A).

These data suggest that Rb and E2f3 colocalize in SACs and that E2f3 triggers defects in SAC differentiation because it is specifically expressed in these retinal neurons.

These data are consistent with the observation that E2f1 overexpression in newborn photoreceptors drives ectopic division and apoptosis [ 60], and add to the growing evidence indicating that E2f1 is the major, and perhaps only, member of the three activating E2fs required to induce apoptosis in Rb KO cells [ 10, 15].
