Recently the MLIV gene, MCOLN1, has been identified as a new member of the transient receptor potential ( TRP) cation channel superfamily.

Loss of function mutants of the MCOLN1 C. elegans homologue, cup - 5, result in an increased rate of endocytosis, accumulation of large vacuoles, and a decreased rate of endocytosed protein breakdown; while over - expression of this gene reverses the phenotype [ 13].

This speculation is supported by work with cup - 5 [ 13], the c. elegans homologue of MCOLN1, since cellular localization studies suggest that the protein is found in the late endosomes and / or lysosomes.

Construction of a targeted allele of Tbx15 confirmed that the deH phenotype was caused by Tbx15 loss of function.

By positional cloning and gene targeting, we identify an allele of droopy ear, deH, as a loss of function for Tbx15, which encodes a T - box transcription factor expressed in a dynamic and spatially restricted manner in the developing skin and musculoskeletal system.

Differences between dorsal and ventral pigmentation of at / at mice are usually attributed to pigment - type differences caused by ventral - specific expression of Agouti, but animals homozygous for a null allele of Agouti, extreme nonagouti ( ae), have ventral hairs that contain less melanin than dorsal hairs, giving a slightly paler appearance to the ventral coat ( Figure 1G).	"Agouti	164	170	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Agouti	216	222	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Agouti"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 170, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Agouti"", ""start_span"": 216, ""end_span"": 222, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
By contrast, skin from at / at mice reveal an abrupt dorsoventral transition of DOPA staining, which probably reflects the additive effects of reduced melanin content ( as in ae / ae mice) and downregulation of tyrosinase activity induced by Agouti.

To investigate this pattern in more detail, we hybridized a Tbx15 mRNA probe to a series of transverse sections at E12. 5 and observed expression in multiple mesenchymal tissues of the head, trunk, and developing limbs ( Figure 4A), much of which is consistent with the skull, cervical vertebrae, and limb malformations reported for mice carrying the original droopy ear allele.

Although the effects of Agouti on pigment - type switching occur during postnatal hair growth, the ventral - specific isoform of Agouti is expressed in developing skin beginning at E11. 5.	"Agouti	24	30	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Agouti	129	135	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Agouti"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Agouti"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The junction between expression domains is indistinct, and by E14. 5, Tbx15 expression extends ventrally and overlaps extensively with Agouti expression ( Figure 5C and 5D).	"Tbx15	70	75	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Agouti	135	141	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Tbx15"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Agouti"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The observations described above are consistent with a model in which transient expression of Tbx15 in the embryonic dorsal flank is required to establish positional identity of the future dermis, at least with respect to pigment - type synthesis caused by the ventral - specific Agouti isoform.

We evaluated the embryonic skin fragments for their potential to give rise to different hair colors and for their expression of Tbx15 and Agouti.

As predicted from the experiments using tissue sections ( see Figures 5 and 6), dorsal pieces expressed Tbx15 but not Agouti, while flank pieces expressed both genes ( see Figure 7).

The deH allele is caused by a large deletion that removes most of the Tbx15 coding sequence, but the pleiotropic phenotype is caused by a simple loss of function for Tbx15 rather than a dominant - negative or contiguous gene effect.	"Tbx15	70	75	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Tbx15	166	171	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Tbx15"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Tbx15"", ""start_span"": 166, ""end_span"": 171, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In particular, there is no heterozygous phenotype, no other genes lie within or close to the deletion breakpoints, and the expression pattern of Tbx15 is consistent with the spectrum of phenotypic abnormalities in both the original de allele and the deH allele.

Loss of Tbx15 affects dorsoventral transitions of hair length, pigment content, and expression of the ventral - specific Agouti isoform; however, the former two effects are subtle and contribute little, if at all, to the abnormal pigmentation of adult deH / deH mice.

Despite high levels of Tbx22 expression in periocular embryonic mesenchyme ( Braybrook et al. 2002; Bush et al. 2002; Herr et al. 2003), the condition does not affect the eye, perhaps because residual activity is provided by Tbx15 in the same region.

Two of us ( S. Kuijper and F. Meijlink) became interested in the deH mutation because of its effects on skeletal development ( Curry 1959) and the possibility that the aristaless - related gene Alx3 might be allelic with droopy ear ( ten Berge et al. 1998).

Our attention to the role of Tbx15 in pigment patterning was motivated by the effects of Agouti in postnatal animals.

Because an expanded domain of embryonic Agouti expression in deH / deH animals is detectable by E14. 5, the effects of Tbx15 on dorsoventral patterning must occur prior to this time.	"Agouti	40	46	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Tbx15	119	124	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Agouti"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Tbx15"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
One potential target is Alx4, which, like Agouti, is expressed in ventral embryonic mesenchyme, and, when mutated, affects hair - follicle as well as limb and craniofacial development ( Qu et al. 1997, 1998; Wu et al. 2000; Wuyts et al. 2000; Mavrogiannis et al. 2001).

In the case of Lmx1b, its expression in the distal limb depends on Wnt7a produced in the overlying dorsal ectoderm ( Riddle et al. 1995; Cygan et al. 1997; Loomis et al. 1998).	"Lmx1b	15	20	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Wnt7a	67	72	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Lmx1b"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Wnt7a"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Wnt7a, in turn, is restricted to dorsal ectoderm by En1 in the ventral ectoderm ( Loomis et al. 1996; Cygan et al. 1997; Logan et al. 1997), whose expression marks a lineage boundary coincident with the dorsoventral midline of the apical ectodermal ridge ( Altabef et al. 1997; Michaud et al. 1997; Kimmel et al. 2000).	"Wnt7a	0	5	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"En1	52	55	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Wnt7a"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""En1"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
As described above, En1 or Wnt7a mutations have not been reported to affect patterns of hair - color distribution ( C. Loomis, personal communication; Parr and McMahon 1995; Loomis et al. 1996).	"En1	20	23	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Wnt7a	27	32	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""En1"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Wnt7a"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We speculate that a diffusible signal from dorsal trunk ectoderm, at or prior to E11. 5, promotes expression of Tbx15 in dorsal trunk mesenchyme, which then establishes dorsal positional identity of those cells as manifested by differences in Agouti expression, pigment - cell development, and hair growth.	"Tbx15	112	117	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Agouti	243	249	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Tbx15"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Agouti"", ""start_span"": 243, ""end_span"": 249, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Because the ventral limit of Tbx15 expression corresponds to the dorsal limit of En1 expression and because the normal position of the pigmentation boundary lies approximately in register with the limb - bud outgrowths, we depict the position of a putative dorsoventral boundary in trunk ectoderm as coincident with the limb dorsoventral boundary.	"Tbx15	29	34	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"En1	81	84	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Tbx15"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""En1"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
It is possible that Tbx15 influences skin patterning in a very narrow window of development; alternatively, establishment of dorsal identity by Tbx15 may require another as - yet - unidentified factor that is only present in the mesenchyme underlying dorsal ectoderm.

The Tbx15 probe was generated by RT - PCR using primers GGCGGCTAAAATGAGTGAAC and TGCCTGCTTTGGTGATGAT ( corresponds to exons 1 and 2), and the En1 probe was generated by PCR from genomic DNA using primers ACGCACCAGGAAGCTAAAGA and AGCAACGAAAACGAAACTGG ( located in the last exon).

Interestingly, Dhcr24 null mice are viable but contained almost no cholesterol in plasma and tissues at 3 - months, whereas cholesterol content in Dhcr24 null embryo tissues accounts for ~ 60% at E11. 5 and ~ 30% at E17. 5, of total tissue sterols [ 38].

One explanation of why the Dhcr24 - / - mice are developmentally normal but Dhcr7 - / - mice are affected may be because desmosterol can functionally substitute for cholesterol, whereas the other cholesterol precursors can not.

To determine whether dopamine D2 receptor - mediated signaling contributes to associative and reversal learning, we compared C57Bl / 6J mice that completely lack functional dopamine D2 receptors to wild - type mice with respect to their ability to attach appropriate salience to external stimuli ( stimulus discrimination) and disengage from inappropriate behavioral strategies when reinforcement contingencies change ( e. g. reversal learning).

Currently it is held that excitatory dopamine D1Rs mediate the acquisition and expression of several conditioned behaviors involving food reinforcers [ e. g.

Despite a growing literature demonstrating disrupted associative learning following acute manipulations of dopamine D1R signaling during acquisition of associative learning tasks with food [ e. g.

Past experiments seeking to explore the possible involvement of dopamine D2Rs in associative learning have utilized low to moderate doses of drugs [ 2, 5, 6] and site - specific administration [ 7, 9] in order to avoid the confounding effect that locomotor disruption associated with acute D2R blockade can have on learning performance in rodents.

Besides their lack of receptor subtype specificity, an acute exposure to commercially available D2 receptor antagonists fails to completely block signaling mediated solely by D2Rs.

Moreover, the number of commission errors committed during the first reversal session ( an index of stimulus bound perseveration, where all animals are responding to the reversed contingencies for the first time; Fig. 6) indicated a deficit in the D2R - / - mice compared to the D2R + / + mice ( U = 8. 5, p < 0. 01).

Rather, the impaired ability of D2R - / - mice to assign appropriate discriminative stimulus relationships in an operant discrimination task argues that D2R - mediated signaling contributes to the neuronal processes involved in attaching salience to environmental stimuli.

The deficient capacity of D2R - / - mice to disengage inappropriate decision strategies strongly argues that mesolimbic dopamine signaling, mediated by dopamine D2Rs is essential for efficient reversal learning to occur.

The comparatively poor skill of D2R - / - mice during discrimination trials suggests a role for D2Rs in acquisition of appropriate S + / S - relationships in operant associative learning.

Most literature reviews identify dopamine D1Rs with dopamine - mediated learning and D2Rs with motor related behaviors [ e. g. [ 24]].

However, only acute administrations of antagonists were given, and learning was not measured during complete D1R or D2R blockade [ 6].

Significantly, the reports cited above failed to address the technical limitations of the approach: i. e. that the antagonists used lack adequate subtype specificity and only partially blocked D2R - mediated signaling thus making it impossible to rigorously assess the role of D2R - mediated signaling in associative and reversal learning.

That D2R - mediated signaling orchestrates just motor components of learning is a conclusion that is potentially biased due to the practice of avoiding doses of drugs that induce catalepsy ( and therefore measuring only partial blockade of dopamine D2Rs) and single administrations [ e. g. [ 3]].

"One might then ask: "" How then could the role of D2Rs in associative learning be dissociated from motor behavior?

A cursory analysis of our data might suggest to some that the genetic manipulation of the drd2 locus conferred a gross olfactory impairment to the D2R - / - mice.

The performance of D2R - / - mice during reversal learning is deficient revealing a role for dopamine D2R - mediated signaling in tasks requiring behavioral flexibility	"D2R	19	22	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"dopamine D2R	93	105	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""D2R"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""dopamine D2R"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Perseverative behavioral patterns characterized the D2R - / - mice relative to D2R + / + mice during reversal learning sessions ( Figure 4), manifested during early reversal trials ( Figure 6) and persisted across several sessions ( Figure 7).

Nonetheless, the inability of D2R - / - mice to disengage from previously established S + / S - contingencies ( responding to a discriminative stimulus; Fig. 4) strongly argues that mesolimbic dopamine, and in particular dopamine D2R - mediated signaling, modulates the process of alerting the subject that familiar contingencies are now associated unexpected consequences.	"D2R	30	33	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"dopamine D2R	221	233	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""D2R"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""dopamine D2R"", ""start_span"": 221, ""end_span"": 233, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The inability of the D2R - / - mice to desist responding to a previously reinforced stimulus suggests that the dopamine D2R might in fact be the focal point of this error - signaling cascade.

Electrophysiological data further support the hypothesis that signaling mediated by dopamine D2Rs tunes D1R - mediated mesocorticolimbic output.

Consequently, we are compelled to conclude that the perseverative performance deficits demonstrated by the D2R - / - mice in the tasks used in the present study reveal a previously unreported role for D2Rs in associative and reversal learning.

The SDP repeat of human TACC1 - 3 is known to bind GAS41 ( [ 3, 15] and data not shown).

In deuterostomes, this exon contains the SDP repeat ( or in the case of the murine TACC3 ' s, a rodent - specific 24 amino acid repeat), which is responsible for the binding of the SWI / SNF chromatin remodeling complex component GAS41 [ 15, 16].

Of the vertebrate TACC proteins, the TACC3 orthologues show the greatest variability in size and sequence, ranging in size from 599 amino acids for the rat TACC3 protein, to 942 amino acids in the Danio rerio protein.

TACC3 can be divided into three sections: a conserved N - terminal region ( CNTR) of 108 amino acids, encoded by exons 2 and 3 in each vertebrate TACC3 gene, the conserved TACC domain distributed over the final seven exons, and a highly variable central region.

In the case of TACC2, an additional large ( 5 kb) exon accounts for the main difference between the major splice variants of the vertebrate TACC2 genes [ 3].

Variants that functionally delete exons 2 and / or 3, such as variant C ( lane 15) also remove the predicted nuclear localization signals, and the binding domains for GAS41 and PCTAIRE2BP.

However, the assignment of the human homologue of CG14540 is less clear, with the closest matches in the human databases corresponding to glutamine rich transcription factors such as CREB and the G - box binding factor.

From this analysis, it seems likely that the vertebrate TACC3 protein has retained this direct ancestral function, based upon its location in these structures during mitosis [ 27], its strong interaction with Aurora Kinase A, and the observation that it is the only human TACC protein phosphorylated by this enzyme [ 21].

For instance, in X. laevis, the maskin protein has acquired a binding site for the eIF4E protein, and thus a function in the coordinated control of polyadenylation and translation in the Xenopus oocyte [ 8, 35].

Indeed, the first assigned function of a vertebrate TACC protein, mouse TACC3, was as a transcriptional coactivator of the ARNT mediated transcriptional response to hypoxia and polyaromatic hydrocarbons [ 7].

Mouse TACC3 has also been reported to interact with the transcription factor STAT5 [ 33].

Recently, we have demonstrated that TACC2 and TACC3 can bind to nuclear histone acetyltransferases [ 34], further confirming a more direct role for the TACC proteins in transcriptional and chromatin remodeling events.

Interestingly although all human TACC proteins can directly interact with the histone acetyltransferase pCAF in vitro, the TACC1 isoforms expressed in human breast cancer cells do not interact with this histone acetylase [ 34].

Thus, alternative splicing of the TACC1 gene adds further diversity to TACC1 function, as the deletion of specific exons and their associated binding domains will change the potential protein complexes with which they can associate, either directly, or by redirecting the splice variants to different subcellular compartments.

With the duplication of the TACC1 / TACC2 ancestor, it is apparent that an even greater functional diversity may have been introduced into the TACC family.

In a screen of fetal mice carrying chemically induced genetic mutations, the authors found that a mutation in the gene Fog2 ( Friend of gata 2), causes abnormal diaphragm development and small lungs.

However, in situ expression analysis demonstrated that the expression of HGF in the region where this structure meets the membranous diaphragm was markedly reduced in Fog2 mutant mice ( Figure 6).

Because the FOG2 mutation we report is de novo and the phenotypes of the pulmonary and diaphragmatic defects are similar between mouse and human, we suggest that this mutation in FOG2 is the first reported cause of a human developmental diaphragmatic and pulmonary defect.

It is less clear whether loss of Fog2 results in a global branching defect, as Fog2 lungs appear to have a slight developmental delay, which could result from many causes.

Despite the minimal changes in rod gene expression at later postnatal timepoints, there was evidence of a significant delay in the onset of rhodopsin ( Rho) expression in rd7 mutants relative to wild - type.

Analysis of several photoreceptor transcription factors in the rd7 mutant indicated that the levels of Crx and Nrl are unaffected in the mutant at P14 ( see Figure 2, lower right photomicrographs).

As mentioned above, Nrl is a retinal transcription factor that, when mutated, results in en masse conversion of rods into S - opsin - expressing cones [ 24].

This finding further suggests that, in addition to its repression of cone gene expression via induction of Nr2e3 expression, Nrl exerts an additional level of negative control over cone genes either directly or via a second, as yet uncharacterized, repressor.

[ 18] showed up - regulation by Northern blot of two additional genes in the rd7 mutant, Elovl2 and Fabp7.

Although we found Elovl2 to have a cone - enriched pattern of expression ( see Figure 1), in situ hybridization analysis of Fabp7 failed to show a signal in wild - type or mutant retina ( unpublished data).

Given the expression pattern elsewhere in the nervous system, it is possible that Fabp7 is up - regulated in M u ller glia in the rd7 retina in response to injury in a manner akin to the novel M u ller glial gene identified in this study, RIKEN cDNA 4933409K07 ( Figure 1, gene G47).

In contrast to the marked derepression of the vast majority of cone - specific genes in the rd7 mutant, two genes stand out as being unaffected by the mutation: the gene encoding M - opsin and Thrb2.

An additional observation suggesting that M - opsin and S - opsin are controlled by different mechanisms comes from in vitro experiments [ 31, 32].

Since virtually all M - opsin - expressing cells are localized at the outer edge of the ONL by P28 in the rd7 mutant ( Figure S8), any increase in M - opsin transcript in the mutant must have occurred in cells in that location.

One of these genes, Pygm, is involved in glycogen / glucose metabolism, and a second, Glo1, is required for detoxification of methylglyoxal, a byproduct of glycolysis [ 33].

A third gene involved in glucose metabolism, hexokinase 2 ( Hk2), is also derepressed in the rd7 mutant and shows a pattern of expression in the wild - type retina, suggesting greater expression in cones than in rods ( see Figure 1; Table S1).

A fourth gene involved in glucose metabolism, glucokinase regulatory protein ( Gckr), was found to be increased in three out of three microarrays at P21 but was not tested by in situ hybridization ( Table S4).

A previous study found that two of these genes, Pygm and Hk2, have markedly elevated tag levels in an ONL - specific serial analysis of gene expression library consistent with their being highly enriched in wild - type photoreceptors [ 34].

Assuming that Nr2e3 acts cell autonomously, we can conclude that the supernumerary S - cone - positive cells and the hybrid photoreceptors identified in the rd7 retina were redirected to these fates from postmitotic cells that were destined to become rods.

Namely, the signal is unlikely to derive from a population of cells coexpressing both rod and cone genes but whose photopigment is rhodopsin and not S - cone opsin.

It is possible that there are gene regulatory differences between mice and humans such that in human NR2E3 mutants, S - opsin shows a type I pattern of derepression rather than a type II as in seen in the rd7 mouse, and is therefore expressed in all of the hybrid photoreceptor cells.

In particular, loss - of - function mutations in the polarity gene crumbs ( CRB1) have been shown to cause morphological abnormalities of the ONL in both humans and mice, including rosette formation in mice very similar to that seen in the rd7 mutant [ 48, 49].

The protein, Atrx, was ubiquitously expressed, and male embryos null for Atrx implanted and gastrulated normally but did not survive beyond 9. 5 days postcoitus due to a defect in formation of the extraembryonic trophoblast, one of the first terminally differentiated lineages in the developing embryo.

To investigate the role of this protein during mouse development, we generated a conditionally deleted allele of the Atrx gene in mouse embryonic stem ( ES) cells, and used these cells to examine the effect of ablating expression of the full - length Atrx protein in ES cells and in mouse embryos.

Like the human gene, the mouse Atrx gene is also X - linked, such that a direct disruption of the single Atrx allele in male ES cells would immediately give rise to the null state.

Exon 18 encodes the first of the seven motifs composing the conserved SNF2 - like domain of Atrx ( Figure 1); mutation of the corresponding motif of the yeast SNF2 protein has been shown to severely impair SWI / SNF - dependent gene expression [ 12].

Finally, we investigated whether the growth defect in the Atrxnull ES cells was due to an up - regulation of apoptosis by staining cells with Annexin V ( Figure S2) and found that the proportion of apoptotic cells was not significantly affected by the absence of full - length Atrx.

To generate Atrxnull mice by Cre - mediated recombination, the Atrxflox mice were crossed with mice harboring a transgene in which the Cre recombinase is expressed under the control of the regulatory elements of the mouse GATA - 1 gene ( GATA1 - cre) [ 14].

We more accurately defined the onset of GATA1 - cre expression using a ROSA26 reporter strain, in which a beta - galactosidase / neor fusion reporter gene is expressed only after Cre - mediated excision of loxP - flanked transcription and translation termination signals [ 14].

To generate Atrxnull mice, heterozygous floxed females ( AtrxWT / flox) were mated with homozygous GATA1 - cre transgenic males ( AtrxWT / Y; GATA1 - cre + / +).

No Atrxnull males ( Atrxnull / Y; GATA1 - cre + / -) were recovered at birth, indicating that the absence of Atrx results in embryonic lethality.

The head fold had clearly formed, and expression of the early mesoderm marker brachyury ( T) [ 16] was detected in the primitive streak and emerging notochord by whole - mount in situ hybridisation ( WMISH) ( Figure 5F), indicating that Atrxnull embryos had gastrulated.

Vacated deciduas surrounding 8. 5 dpc wild - type and Atrxnull embryos were bisected and analysed by WMISH for expression of placental lactogen - 1 ( Pl - 1), a marker of terminally differentiated TGCs.

We found that the population of Pl - 1 - expressing cells was depleted in the decidual implantation sites containing Atrxnull embryos relative to those containing wild - type littermates ( Figure 7B); this was also apparent at 7. 5 dpc, as determined by immunohistochemical staining of paraffin sections of embryos in deciduas with an anti - Pl - 1 antibody ( Figure 7C).

A TGC deficiency in the absence of Atrx is consistent with the observation that Atrx is highly expressed in giant cells surrounding wild - type 7. 5 dpc embryos ( Figure 5E).

To investigate whether the trophoblast defect was restricted to the production of secondary TGCs ( produced by diploid precursors in the ectoplacental cone and derived originally from the polar trophectoderm overlying the inner cell mass of the blastocyst) or also affected the production of primary TGCs ( resulting from differentiation of the mural trophectoderm of the blastocyst), blastocysts ( 3. 5 dpc) from crosses between AtrxWT / flox females and GATA1 - Cre homozygous transgenic males ( AtrxWT / Y; GATA1 - Cre + / +) were cultured in vitro for 5 d to monitor outgrowth of the primary trophoblast.

Female mice carrying an Atrxnull allele ( AtrxWT / null; GATA1 - cre + / -) were detected at 9. 5 dpc ( Table 1) and recovered at birth ( unpublished data), although at both time points the number of carrier females was lower than that of wild - type ( AtrxWT / WT; GATA1 - cre + / -) females, suggesting that a proportion of carrier female embryos died in utero.

In contrast, it was recently shown that the loss of Atrx markedly increased the apoptotic population in the differentiating cells of the embryonic cortex and postnatal hippocampus, when Atrx expression was ablated in the developing mouse forebrain using the Atrxflox allele described here [ 20].

The human ATRX protein has been shown to associate in a complex with Daxx [ 8], a protein that has been implicated in multiple pathways for the regulation of apoptosis [ 21].

It is possible that disruption of the mouse Atrx - Daxx complex ( by ablation of the Atrx protein) could have triggered a universal proapoptotic response.

Embryonic lethality in mice in the absence of Atrx was a surprising finding, as there had been no suggestion of foetal loss in the human ATR - X syndrome.

It is possible that the role of Atrx in the trophoblast is specific to mice and that ATRX has no role or is redundant in the human trophoblast.

Some full - length ATRX protein is detected in cases predicted to have truncating mutations ( RJG, unpublished data), and residual ATPase activity in ATRX immunoprecipitates can be detected in Epstein - Barr virus - transformed lymphocytes of all human patients analysed to date ( A.

The failure to observe a truly null ATRX allele among human patients strongly suggests that, as in the mouse, the complete absence of ATRX protein is incompatible with human fetal survival.

While this study has revealed an unexpected role for Atrx in the murine trophectoderm, as a result of the early lethality observed in Atrxnull embryos it is not possible to rule out other roles for Atrx at later developmental stages in tissues of the embryo proper.

Indeed, we show that Atrx is highly expressed throughout the entire developing embryo at 7. 5 dpc ( Figure 5B), and it is likely that Atrx function will turn out to be important for other differentiating tissues.

Cdx2 - mutant embryos fail to implant and die between 3. 5 and 5. 5 dpc [ 26], while Eomes - mutant blastocysts implant into the uterus, but arrest soon after implantation without forming organised embryonic or extraembryonic structures [ 27].

Also like Atrx, disruption of Hand1 specifically affects secondary giant cell formation, and primary trophoblast outgrowths from blastocysts appeared normal.

The secondary TGCs affected in the universal Atrx knockout reported here represent one of the first terminally differentiated tissues in the developing mouse, and this may point to the requirement for Atrx in the high - level expression of some tissue - specific genes during the final stages of differentiation.

One possibility is that, like some other X - linked genes, silencing of the Atrx gene on Xp is incomplete, such that there is always a low - level, leaky output of Atrx from a normally inactivated Xp chromosome in extraembryonic tissues.

However, it was recently demonstrated that the paternal Atrx ( called Xnp) allele is completely silenced in a normal mouse trophoblast stem cell line [ 32], suggesting that Atrx does not normally escape imprinted X - inactivation in the extraembryonic tissues of wild - type females.

Results of conditional inactivation of Atrx in the developing mouse forebrain, based on the Atrxflox allele described here, shows that Atrx exerts a major effect on terminally differentiating neurons.

To understand the role of Apc in development and in organs other than intestine, we generated Apc mutant mice that can conditionally delete the gene when exposed to Cre recombinase.

Loss of APC is associated with stabilization of the cytosolic beta - catenin that ultimately results in its migration to the nucleus and activating a cascade of events leading to tumorigenesis.

These interactions suggest that APC can potentially regulate many cellular functions, including intercellular adhesion, cytoskeletal organization, regulation of plakoglobin levels, regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis, orientation of asymmetric stem cell division, and control of cell polarization [ 2, 3].

One approach to understand the role of Apc in development is to develop mice with an inactivating Apc mutation.

To assess the role of Apc in different stages of life systematically, we generated mice containing a conditional knockout ( CKO) mutant allele of Apc ( ApcCKO).

We report here that K14 promoter - driven loss of Apc resulted in aberrant development of several organs that require inductive epithelial - mesenchymal interactions, including hair follicle, teeth, and thymus, and resulted in neonatal death in mice.

We found that Apc plays a crucial role in determinations of cell fates during the embryonic development, possibly via temporal and tissue - specific regulation of beta - catenin levels in the skin, its appendages, and in the thymus.

To investigate the role of Apc in development of skin and its appendages, we used the Cre / loxP technology to introduce a conditional mutation of the Apc gene in mice.

We constructed embryonic stem ( ES) cells and mice carrying an Apc allele harboring both a pair of loxP sites flanking Apc exon 14 and a pair of FLP recognition target ( FRT) sites flanking PGK - neomycin selection cassette by recombineering [ 12, 13] ( Figure 1A, ApcCKON allele, N for neomycin cassette).

We analyzed 30 intestinal tumors from Apc Delta 580 / + mice by in vitro transcription and translation assay, but none of them showed truncated Apc products ( unpublished data), indicating that the most likely mechanism of wild - type Apc inactivation is by allelic loss.

To assess the molecular effects of the K14 - cre - mediated recombination, we screened for the presence of deleted Apc ( Apc Delta 580) alleles.

Genomic DNA was extracted from liver, thymus, and skin from all 4 possible genotypes: K14 - cre; ApcCKO / CKO, K14 - cre; ApcCKO / +, ApcCKO / CKO, and ApcCKO / +.

The presence of mutant Apc allele in the thymus of K14 - cre; ApcCKO / + mice was consistently much less than the DNA from the skin of the same animal or other tissues from the KA mutants.

We detected the expected RT - PCR product ( 313 bp) from the truncated Apc ( Apc Delta 580) allele only in the tissues where Cre recombinase is known to be expressed in the K14 - cre - positive mice.

However, this product was not detected in either the K14 - cre - negative mouse tissues samples or the liver of K14 - cre - positive mice, and only the product from the wild - type allele ( 528 bp) was detected from these RNA samples, further confirming that Cre - mediated recombination has taken place in the tissue - and genotype - specific manner ( Figure 3B).

Similar to the biology of hair follicles, K14 - cre - driven loss of Apc also affected the development of other epidermal appendages that depend on epithelial - mesenchymal interactions for their formation.

In contrast to K14 expression, diffuse staining for K8 was observed in epithelial cells both in the medulla and cortex ( Figure S3).

However, there were small populations of lightly stained cells by H & E extending from the edge of the outer cortex towards inner medulla ( Figure 6E), and these cells showed intense nuclear beta - catenin staining whereas the rest of the medullary cells showed diffuse beta - catenin staining pattern similar to that of the control ( Figure 6F).

At P10 - P13, the mutant thymus consisted of numerous enlarged Hassall ' s corpuscle - like structures, made of arrays of K14 - and K8 - expressing keratinizing epithelial cells surrounding large keratin deposits ( Figure 6L and 6O).

The underlying genetic lesion causing the opt phenotype is a homozygous in - frame deletion of exons 43 and 44 of the gene Itpr1 ( Itpr1opt / opt), encoding inositol 1, 4, 5 - triphosphate receptor 1 ( Itpr1).

Sequencing of all exons and intron - exon boundaries of Itpr1 in affected mice from the current study revealed a single mutation within Itpr1: a novel in - frame deletion of 18 bp within exon 36 ( Itpr1 Delta 18 / Delta 18).

In these two spontaneous mutants [ 1] and in the Itpr1 - deficient mouse [ 4] generated by gene targeting, decreased Itpr1 expression is associated with the same autosomal recessive movement disorder ( Figure 1).

However, visualization of log R ratio and B allele frequency metrics from the genome - wide SNP genotyping experiments clearly showed data consistent with a heterozygous genomic deletion across the first one - third of ITPR1 and across the first half of a neighboring gene, SUMF1 ( Figure 2).

With three cerebellar ataxia families segregating a SUMF1 - ITPR1 deletion, and this deletion not observed in a control population, we may reasonably conclude that the association is causal, and that the deletion is indeed the genetic basis of the disease, with SCA15 the diagnosis in the two British families as well as the original Australian family.

It is improbable that heterozygosity for the deletion of SUMF1, encoding sulfatase modifying factor 1, of itself causes or contributes to SCA15.

In further support of this conclusion, analysis of protein levels of ITPR1 in Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV) immortalized lymphocytes from affected and unaffected AUS1 family members revealed that all affected members showed a dramatic decrease in ITPR1 levels when compared with the family member without the deletion ( Figure 4).

Second, we cannot rule out the existence of an alternate start site for ITPR1 that may result in a product that confers a pathogenic gain of function to the protein; however, Western blot analysis of cells derived from affected AUS1 family members, which was performed using an antibody raised against the C - terminal portion of ITPR1, failed to identify any disease - specific truncated protein products.

Clearly, sequence analysis of ITPR1 in potential SCA15 cases may provide additional insight into the disease, particularly if a stop mutation were to be identified; however, the mutational mechanism noted here means that standard sequencing approaches alone are insufficient to confidently rule out ITPR1 mutation as a cause of disease: a comprehensive gene dosage approach is also required.
