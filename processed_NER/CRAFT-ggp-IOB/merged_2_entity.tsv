The second paper providing evidence, by Davies et al [ 26], is a biochemical study of the interaction between the homologous recombinase RAD51 and a peptide consisting of one of the eight BRC repeats from human BRCA2.

These experiments raise the possibility that the full - length BRCA2 protein could act as a negative regulator of inappropriate RAD51 - DNA interaction.

The final experiment reported by Davies et al [ 26] is particularly important with respect to understanding the mechanism ( s) through which BRCA2 promotes RAD51 - dependent recombination.

In the absence of this interaction with BRCA2, RAD51 might exist in a form that is not capable of being recruited into a functional repair complex when damage occurs.

Alternatively, or in addition, suppression of RAD51 - ssDNA interaction might be important for preventing RAD51 from binding to the regions of ssDNA that form during normal DNA replication.

Finally, it is important to note that the two models for the function of the BRCA2 - RAD51 interaction shown in Figure 2 are not mutually exclusive.

It should be relatively straightforward to determine whether the role of BRCA2 is limited to transporting RAD51 to the nucleus.

In the heterozygous mice, sterol secretion increased to reach a maximal level of about 50% of the wild type suggesting that Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 is a rate - limiting step for biliary ' cholesterol ' secretion.

Furthermore, complete loss of Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 results in an inability to secrete cholesterol into bile, although secretion of sitosterol seemed to be preserved.

Despite this reservation, the finding that sitosterol is present in the bile suggests that plant sterols may be secreted independent of Abcg8 / sterolin - 2.

While biliary cholesterol secretion is not completely absent in the Abcg8 - deficient mice it would appear that sterolin - 2 plays a major role in this process.

We next turned to the presence of cytoplasmic Ajuba for a possible mechanistic link to the proliferative increase in our Snail Tg epidermis.

Given the increase in pMAPK staining in Tg skin, we examined the possibility that Ajuba might have changed its binding partner in Snail - expressing epidermis.

Indeed, when serum - starved keratinocytes were transiently transfected with an Ajuba expression vector, the levels of pMAPK were not only elevated but also comparable to those transfected with the K14 - HASnail transgene ( Figure 4F).

The temporal spike of Snail mRNA expression in the hair bud prompted us to consider what factor ( s) may be regulating the Snail gene.

Thus, despite essential roles for Wnts and noggin in hair follicle specification [ 4, 29, 30], our studies did not support an essential role for these signals in governing Snail expression in keratinocytes.	noggin,43,49,Gene_or_geneproduct	Snail,172,177,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""noggin"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 172, ""end_span"": 177, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	train

Of the loss - of - function mutations generated in each of the TGF - beta genes, only the TGF - beta 2 null state blocked follicle development at the hair bud stage [ 32].

Thus, we turned towards addressing whether TGF - beta 2 might be involved in regulating Snail expression in keratinocytes isolated from the basal layer of the epidermis.

Interestingly, treatment of cultured keratinocytes with as little as 5 ng / ml of TGF - beta 2 caused a rapid and transient induction of Snail ( Figure 5B).

The induction of Snail appeared to be specific for the active form of the growth factor, as pretreatment of TGF - beta 2 for 10 min at 100 degrees C obliterated the response [ Figure 5B, lanes marked ( -)].

Thus, although Snail expression correlated with phosphorylated SMAD2 ( pSMAD2) induction, its decline seemed to rely on secondary downstream events.

At 2 d after transient transfection, keratinocytes were treated with TGF - beta 2 ( t = 0) and then assayed for transgene activity over the same time course in which we had observed Snail protein induction.

Within 0. 5 h of TGF - beta 2 treatment, Snail promoter activity had increased 3 - fold, and by 2 h, it peaked to approximately 10 - fold over control levels ( Figure 5D).

Moreover, the downstream effector of TGF - beta 2 signaling, pSMAD2, was also expressed in WT, but not TGF - beta 2 - null, hair buds ( Figure 6B).

As judged by immunohistochemistry, Snail protein was absent from E17. 5 skin of TGF - beta 2 - null embryos but not from that of control littermates ( Figure 6C).

This effect appeared to be exerted at the transcriptional level, since Snail mRNAs were also not found in TGF - beta 2 null hair buds under conditions in which the signal was readily detected in the hair buds of littermate skin ( Figure 6D).

Taken together, these results provide compelling evidence that TGF - beta 2 is functionally important for inducing Snail gene expression in a pSMAD - dependent manner in developing hair buds.

Consistent with this notion, basement membrane remodeling still took place in the TGF - beta 2 - null buds, as judged by immunofluorescence with antibodies against beta 4 integrin, an integral component of keratinocyte - mediated adhesion to its underlying basement membrane ( Figure 6F).

In contrast, TGF - beta 2 signaling appeared to be an important factor for the early proliferation that occurs in the developing hair buds, as judged by anti - Ki67 and anti - pMAPK immunofluorescence ( Figure 6F and 6G).

These data suggest that during hair follicle morphogenesis, TGF - beta 2 functions subsequently to Wnt / noggin - mediated determination of hair fate.

However, in contrast to TGF - beta 1 - null skin, which exhibits an extended growing phase of postnatal hair follicles, TGF - beta 2 - null skin displays an embryonic block in follicle bud progression [ 32].

An additional point worth mentioning is that prolonged expression of Tg Snail in postnatal skin resulted in morphological and biochemical signs of epithelial to mesenchymal transitions ( unpublished data), underscoring why transient Snail expression may be so important during normal hair follicle morphogenesis [ 18].

The K14 promoter is also less active in the ORS than epidermis and hence this might also account for the lack of apparent response of the ORS to ectopic Snail.

In the course of these studies, we also noted that Snail can also contribute to this process in keratinocytes in vitro, and our present studies revealed that Snail is expressed at the right place and time to be physiologically relevant in the process.

The corresponding failure of E - cadherin down - regulation underscores the importance of Wnt / noggin signaling in regulating this event in follicle morphogenesis [ 4].

Embryos positive for either Isl1Cre / + and TauEWS - Pea3 / + or Isl1Cre / + and TaumGFP / + alleles showed efficient activation of the silent Tau allele in 95% or more of all DRG neurons, including proprioceptive afferents, at all segmental levels ( Figure S3).

In summary, whereas isochronic expression of EWS - Pea3 promoted the establishment of proprioceptive afferent projections into the ventral spinal cord, precocious expression of the same ETS signaling factor in DRG neurons interfered with establishment of projections into the spinal cord as well as to peripheral targets.

Addition of NGF, which supports survival of cutaneous afferents, resulted in straight and unbranched neurite outgrowth ( Figure 4B), while cultures grown in the presence of NT - 3, which supports survival of proprioceptive afferents, resulted in a highly branched neurite outgrowth pattern after 48 h in vitro ( Figure 4C).

To determine whether neuronal survival of DRG neurons from TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos in the absence of neurotrophic support is sufficient to explain the observed neuronal outgrowth, we analyzed DRG isolated from mice mutant in the proapoptotic gene Bax [ 27].

This absence of Trk receptor expression in DRG of TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos provides a likely explanation for the lack of responsiveness of these neurons to the addition of neurotrophic factors.

Together with the in vitro culture experiments, these findings suggest that DRG neurons from TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos remain post - mitotic but fail to become sensitive to naturally occurring cell death, and survive in the absence of Trk receptors and neurotrophic support.

Due to a transient and rostro - caudally graded expression of Hb9 at neural plate stages, very few DRG neurons at brachial levels and increasingly more neurons progressing caudally undergo recombination in TauEWS - Pea3 / + Hb9Cre / + and TaumGFP / + Hb9Cre / + embryos ( Figure 8).

Together, these results and the findings obtained from in vitro culture experiments ( see Figures 4 and 5) demonstrate that precocious or isochronic expression of EWS - Pea3 in the same neurons leads to significantly different cell - autonomous cellular responses with respect to gene expression, neuronal survival, and neurite outgrowth ( Figure 9).

To explain the difference between experimental results from dissociated XX gonadal cells and XX gonads, we reasoned that the local concentrations of FGF9 might not be high enough to override blocking signals in the intact XX gonad, or that active FGF9 was not efficiently localized or presented in the extracellular matrix of the XX gonad.

This result supports the idea that there is a mutual interdependence between Sox9 and Fgf9 generating a positive feed - forward loop, and that both genes are required for the expansion of somatic cells, including Sertoli cell precursors, in XY gonads.

The loss of Sertoli cells in XY Fgf9 - / - gonads is not due to cell death, but instead to a transition of supporting cell fate as SOX9 expression is lost.

This, together with the observation that p53 levels decrease during mouse embryogenesis ( 19), suggested an explanation for the observed lack of pregnancies: we speculate that the high levels of p53GFP in the ES cells injected into blastocysts might have prevented normal embryonic development once these cells began to differentiate and the p53 pathway became functional.	p53,41,44,Gene_or_geneproduct	p53,195,198,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""p53"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""p53"", ""start_span"": 195, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	train

Firstly, while the pharyngeal organ migration fails in Alk5 / Wnt1 - Cre mutants, perhaps as a result of increased mesenchymal cell death in the pharyngeal region, both the thymus, thyroid and parathyroid seem to develop relatively normally on the histological level in these mutants.

Since we could not detect appropriate rotation of the OFT in neural crest - specific mutants of Alk5 or Alk2, it appears that cells derived from the NC, as well as those from the SHF, are mutually required for proper OFT rotation in mice.

Thus, conditional removal of BMP4 activity from the posterior limb mesenchyme results in a persistence of the AER, expanded SHH signaling, and consequent preaxial and postaxial polydactyly [ 16].

Similarly, when noggin, a potent BMP inhibitor, is introduced in early stage chick limb buds prior to skeletogenesis, mesenchymal condensation does not take place [ 27, 28].	noggin,16,22,Gene_or_geneproduct	BMP,33,36,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""noggin"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	train
Conversely, removal of individual ligands such as BMP4 [ 16] or BMP7 [ 12, 13] has not displayed defects in skeletal differentiation, presumably due to functional redundancy.

As all prior reported manipulations of the BMP pathway during skeletal development either result in a block at the first stage of chondrogenesis or allow complete skeletal formation, this is the first demonstration of a requirement for BMP activity in osteogenic differentiation.

While a distal phalanx is missing in the middle digits of the double mutants ( Bmp2C / C, Bmp7 - / -; Prx1:: cre), this is not a phenotype consistent with a decrease or loss of a posteriorly derived polarizing activity.

While this explains the broader hand plate of the BMP2, BMP4 - deficient limb buds, it is somewhat paradoxical in terms of the skeletal phenotype, as a broadened autopod would normally be expected to result in the formation of extra digits ( polydactyly) ( e. g., Figure 1G and 1O of this paper and [ 16]), not the loss of digits, as observed in the double mutant forelimbs.

Consistent with the presence of rare ( < 1%) Trip13Gt / Gt pachytene spermatocytes devoid of persistent DNA repair markers, and testis histology showing some degree of postmeiotic progression ( Figure 3G), we observed both diplotene nuclei that lacked autosomal RAD51 / DMC1 and gamma H2AX ( Figure S3A - S3D), and also metaphase I spreads with 20 bivalents ( Figure S3E - S3F).

Since < 1% of Trip13Gt / Gt pachytene nuclei had normal repair ( as judged by absence of persistent DSB repair markers; see above), but most of the pachytene nuclei had MLH1 / 3 foci, it was unlikely that the MLH1 / 3 foci formed only on chromosomes with fully repaired DSBs.

To assess whether these MLH1 / 3 foci in Trip13Gt / Gt pachytene spermatocytes represent CO events completed to a point where they could maintain interhomolog attachments though the end of prophase I, we treated testicular cells from 17. 5 - 20. 5 - d - old control ( + / +), Trip13Gt / Gt, and Dmc1 - / - mice with the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid ( OA), a chemical that induces degradation of the SC, chromosome condensation, and premature progression to metaphase I [ 33].

Whereas all of the Dmc1 - / - spreads had ~ 35 or more condensed chromosomes, all of the + / + and Trip13Gt / Gt spreads had 20 - 25, suggesting that the MLH1 / 3 foci in Trip13Gt / Gt pachytene spermatocytes represent sites of completed, or near - completed, COs.

Notably, A. thaliana does not appear to have a meiotic checkpoint activity that eliminates mutant meiocytes in a manner analogous to organisms such as mice, budding yeast, and female Drosophila [ 11, 57], and mammalian TRIP13 is more similar to Arabidopsis PCH2 than the fly or worm proteins ( Figures 1A and S1).

The unusual relatedness between mammalian and plant PCH2 may therefore be attributable to both the presence of a common conserved function ( namely recombination, although the role of PCH2 in plants has yet to be determined), and the absence of checkpoint function.

We speculate that a diffusible signal from dorsal trunk ectoderm, at or prior to E11. 5, promotes expression of Tbx15 in dorsal trunk mesenchyme, which then establishes dorsal positional identity of those cells as manifested by differences in Agouti expression, pigment - cell development, and hair growth.

The coding sequence of mon is most similar to human TIF gamma ( Le Douarin et al. 1995; Friedman et al. 1996; Venturini et al. 1999), and the locations of exon boundaries are conserved between the zebrafish and human genes ( unpublished data).	mon,23,26,Gene_or_geneproduct	human TIF gamma,46,61,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""mon"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""human TIF gamma"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	test

Because we were able to recover Ptdsr - / - embryos until E18. 5, we investigated whether Ptdsr - knockout mice could be born alive.

These developmental stages were chosen so as to investigate Ptdsr expression in affected organs prior to the onset of pathological malformations in Ptdsr - / - embryos.

We carefully investigated whether Ptdsr is expressed from E10. 5 to E12. 5 in the developing kidney and lungs, but no expression could be detected indicating that Ptdsr expression is required only at later stages in the development of these organs ( see below).

At E18. 5 ( Figure 4c, g) and in neonatal animals ( postnatal day P0; Figure 4d, h), the differences in retinal differentiation between Ptdsr + / + and Ptdsr - / - mice were still evident, but the size reduction of the retinal layers was less pronounced in the knockout mice.

In summary, we observed a wide range of ocular malformations in Ptdsr - deficient mice that ranged from differentiation defects in retinal cell layers ( for example, the inner granular layer) in mildly affected homozygotes to anophthalmia in severely affected Ptdsr - / - mice that was associated with induction of ectopic eye structures in nasal cavities.

Starting at E12. 5, we analyzed and compared the number and distribution of aCasp3 - positive cells in over 140 serial sections of three wild - type and six Ptdsr - / - embryos in consecutive and corresponding sections.	aCasp3,76,82,Gene_or_geneproduct	Ptdsr,157,162,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""aCasp3"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 162, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	test
The same was true for the developing kidney: apoptotic cells were present in Ptdsr + / + and Ptdsr - / - embryos, in limited numbers, but we failed to detect any differences in the number of apoptotic cells between the genotypes ( Figure 6c, 6g).

As already observed at E12. 5, analysis of aCasp3 - stained sections of the developing thymus, heart, diaphragm, genital ridge, eyes and retina convincingly showed that there was no impairment in apoptotic cell removal in Ptdsr - / - mice.	aCasp3,43,49,Gene_or_geneproduct	Ptdsr,222,227,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""aCasp3"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 222, ""end_span"": 227, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	test
Moreover, because Li and colleagues [ 31] reported impaired clearance of dead cells during lung development in Ptdsr - deficient mice, we examined the rate of apoptosis induction and cell clearance in our Ptdsr - knockout mice in the lung.

To analyze whether macrophages are recruited into areas where apoptosis is prominent during embryogenesis, we stained consecutive serial sections either with the macrophage surface marker F4 / 80 or with aCasp3.

Analysis of phagocytosis rates by flow cytometric analysis ( FACS) revealed no differences in the efficacy of apoptotic cell uptake between Ptdsr - / - and Ptdsr + / + macrophages and demonstrated no differences in apoptotic cell engulfment between selected time points ( data not shown).

Ptdsr - deficiency does, however, affect the overall release of pro - and anti - inflammatory cytokines after stimulation with LPS and after double treatment with LPS and apoptotic cells, indicating that Ptdsr - deficient macrophages have a reduced capacity to produce or secrete pro - and anti - inflammatory cytokines.

In the Ptdsr - knockout mouse line reported here, growth retardation started from E12. 5 onwards and was associated with delayed differentiation in several organs in which Ptdsr is expressed either during embryogenesis or later in adulthood.

For this process to occur, AVP binds its receptor, AVPR2, on the basolateral face of the collecting duct cells, leading to a rise in intracellular cAMP, ultimately resulting in phosphorylation of AQP2 at serine 256 by cAMP - dependent protein kinase [ 9] and its redistribution to the plasma membrane.

AMPAR modification was obtained by depletion of the GluR - B subunit or expression of unedited GluR - B ( Q), both leading to increased Ca2 + permeability of AMPARs.

Notably, the normally low Ca2 + permeability of AMPA channels in principal neurons is solely mediated by GluR - B, due to a unique arginine residue ( R587) in the functionally critical glutamine / arginine ( Q / R) site of the pore - forming segment M2 [ 44, 47, 48], resulting from RNA editing of GluR - B pre - mRNA ( [ 49]; reviewed in [ 50]).

Hence, either GluR - B deficiency, or the expression of Q / R site - unedited GluR - B with a glutamine residue at the critical channel site, leads to increased Ca2 + permeability of AMPA channels, as amply demonstrated in gene - targeted mice [ 51, 53, 58, 60].

Moreover, the ablation of GluR - B, but also changes in the extent of Q / R site editing of GluR - B, can alter the strength of excitatory synaptic transmission in the genetically addressed neuronal populations [ 51, 58, 60], thus potentially shifting the balance of excitatory and inhibitory transmission in the affected circuits.

These mice carry, in addition to a wild - type GluR - B allele, a gene - targeted GluR - Bneo allele in which the intronic sequence critical for GluR - B pre - mRNA editing at the Q / R site is replaced by a floxed TK - neo gene, which severely reduces splicing of the modified intron and hence attenuates the expression of the GluR - Bneo allele [ 60].

Furthermore, enhancement in odor discrimination in both GluR - B Delta ECS: FB and GluR - B Delta FB mice makes it likely that improvement in this task results from the common AMPAR property change mediated by the depletion of GluR - B and the lack of the Q / R site - edited GluR - B subunit, both resulting in Ca2 + - permeable AMPARs.

Thus, to examine whether the pronounced variability of olfactory memory in GluR - B Delta FB mice ( Figure 2E) reflects variability of GluR - B levels in GluR - B Delta FB mice, we analyzed the residual amount of GluR - B protein in mice with disparate memory performances ( Figure 4A - C).

Notably, mice with pronounced memory deficits ( memory < 70%) showed essentially no detectable GluR - B protein in hippocampus, amygdala, olfactory bulb, and piriform cortex ( n = 2, Figure 4B, and unpublished data), but mice with almost complete memory displayed substantial residual GluR - B levels in all brain areas investigated ( n = 2, Figure 4B, and unpublished data).

In summary, mice with reduced GluR - B levels in forebrain areas showed decreased olfactory memory, which correlated tightly with a reduction in GluR - B levels in the hippocampus and cortical areas.

Enhanced odor learning and discrimination, on the other hand, was independent of residual GluR - B levels in the olfactory bulb and other forebrain areas, indicating that moderate GluR - B reductions are sufficient to saturate enhanced odor learning and discrimination.

The effect of selective GluR - B depletion in mice indicated that GluR - B - containing AMPARs in the hippocampus, and / or ( olfactory) cortex are likely to be important for olfactory memory.

The olfactory memory phenotype could be due to depletion of GluR - B in olfactory cortex or hippocampus; enhanced learning and discrimination capabilities might rather be evoked by AMPARs lacking GluR - B in the olfactory bulb.

We employed gene - targeted and transgenic mice with region - specific expression to demonstrate that a change in GluR - B - mediated properties of AMPA channels in alpha CaMKII - expressing neurons of mouse forebrain, including olfactory bulb mitral and granule cells, enhances olfactory discrimination and learning but impairs olfactory memory.

This variability could be traced to epigenetic variability in the transgenic expression of Cre - recombinase, which mediated recombination within loxP - flanked segments of gene - targeted alleles for the dominant AMPAR subunit GluR - B, and hence operated the switch in AMPAR properties toward GluR - B ablation and increased Ca2 + permeability.

The subsequent transgene - driven re - introduction of GluR - B, specifically in piriform cortex and hippocampus, reversed the Cre - induced loss of GluR - B and partially rescued the odor memory deficit, but left unaltered the enhanced olfactory discrimination.

This is further supported by kainate - induced Co2 + uptake in acute brain slices, revealing considerably higher Co2 + uptake via Ca2 + - permeable AMPARs in hippocampal pyramidal neurons of mice expressing GluR - B ( Q), than those lacking GluR - B ( DRS, RS, and PHS, unpublished data).

As Ca2 + influx through glutamate receptors is thought to contribute to lateral and recurrent inhibition ( [ 38] see also [ 39]), the absence of GluR - B, or the presence of GluR - B ( Q) in the olfactory bulb, is likely to result in increased inhibition between the principal neurons in this structure.

In interpreting our study, it should be remembered that the earliest plaques to appear in these mice, like other APP transgenics harboring the Swedish mutation [ 27], are predominantly fibrillar deposits, which may be less tractable than the diffuse aggregates thought to come first in the course of the human disease.

We next analyzed deletion constructs in which the N - terminus 400 aa stretch of mr - s ( amino acids 1 to 400) or the C - terminus portion ( amino acids 391 to 542) were fused to the GAL4 DBD ( Fig. 7A, DBD - N, DBD - C).	mr - s,81,87,Gene_or_geneproduct	GAL4,184,188,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""mr - s"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""GAL4"", ""start_span"": 184, ""end_span"": 188, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	test
To determine the regions of mr - s involved in transcriptional repression more precisely, the C - terminus portion was divided into two regions and each was fused to the GAL4 DBD ( Fig. 7A, DBD - tail, DBD - SAM).	mr - s,28,34,Gene_or_geneproduct	GAL4,170,174,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""mr - s"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""GAL4"", ""start_span"": 170, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	test
Our results suggested that the C - terminal region of mr - s ( amino acids 463 to 542) is required for transcriptional repression of mr - s and the SAM domain appears to be dispensable for this repressive activity.	mr - s,54,60,Gene_or_geneproduct	mr - s,133,139,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""mr - s"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mr - s"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	test

Taken together, our findings suggest that DBD - mrs functions as a transcriptional repressor and that the repression activity of mr - s is not due to a homophilic interaction through its SAM domain but to the C - terminal region ( amino acids 463 to 542).	mrs,48,51,Gene_or_geneproduct	mr - s,129,135,Gene_or_geneproduct	"[{""token"": ""mrs"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mr - s"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"	test

However, based on the ability of cell extracts that are defective in two different TFIIH components ( XPD and XPB) to complement NER activity in vitro [ 26], it is likely that TFIIH ( or its components) can either multimerise or exchange at least during the NER reaction.

E2f3a can trigger cell cycle induction, but because SAC defects are not linked to cell cycle perturbation ( Figures 3A and 4), and in view of the predominant association between E2f3b and Rb in quiescent cells [ 16, 19], we suspected that E2f3b may perturb differentiation in Rb KO SACs.
