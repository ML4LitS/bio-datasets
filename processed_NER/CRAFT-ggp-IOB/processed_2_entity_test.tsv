The purpose of this study was to characterize gross lenticular morphology in normal mice and mice with the targeted disruption of alphaA - and alphaB - crystallin genes ( alphaA / BKO).	"alphaA - and alphaB - crystallin	130	162	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"alphaA	171	177	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""alphaA - and alphaB - crystallin"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 162, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""alphaA"", ""start_span"": 171, ""end_span"": 177, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
These results indicated that both alphaA - and alphaB - crystallin are necessary for proper fiber cell formation, and that the absence of alpha - crystallin can lead to cataract formation.	"alphaA - and alphaB - crystallin	34	66	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"alpha - crystallin	138	156	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""alphaA - and alphaB - crystallin"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""alpha - crystallin"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The relative proportion of alphaA and alphaB changes from a molar ratio of 1: 3 in the pericentral and germative zones to a molar ratio of 3: 1 in the elongation zone and fiber cells [ 2, 3].	"alphaA	27	33	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"alphaB	38	44	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""alphaA"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""alphaB"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
These differences in the relative proportions of alphaA and alphaB within the lens suggest different functions for the two subunits in the developing lens.	"alphaA	49	55	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"alphaB	60	66	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""alphaA"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""alphaB"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
AlphaB was found to be expressed at significant levels in a variety of nonlenticular tissues, while alphaA has only been detected in small amounts in a few other tissues such as retina, spleen and thymus [ 8 - 12].	"AlphaB	0	6	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"alphaA	100	106	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""AlphaB"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 6, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""alphaA"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Both alphaA and alphaB can bind specifically to actin, in vitro [ 13] and in vivo [ 14].	"alphaA	5	11	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"alphaB	16	22	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""alphaA"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""alphaB"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In the lens, alpha - crystallin also associates with type III intermediate filament proteins and the beaded filament proteins CP49 and CP115, and correct beaded filament assembly has been shown depend on the presence of alpha - crystallin [ 16].	"CP49	126	130	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"CP115	135	140	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""CP49"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""CP115"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
A nuclear role for alphaB in the lens was supported by the findings that a subset of lens epithelial cells derived from alphaB knockout mice demonstrated hyperproliferation and genomic instability [ 20].	"alphaB	19	25	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"alphaB	120	126	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""alphaB"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""alphaB"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
[ 22] demonstrated, by targeted disruption of the mouse alphaA gene, that this protein was essential for the maintenance of lens transparency, possibly by maintaining the solubility of alphaB, or associated proteins, in the lens.	"mouse alphaA	50	62	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"alphaB	185	191	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""mouse alphaA"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""alphaB"", ""start_span"": 185, ""end_span"": 191, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Cells adjacent to the posterior capsule of 5 wk alphaA / BKO lenses ( Figure 3E) exhibited nucleic acid staining, were small and non - elongated, with numerous membrane projections., These were, however, not observed in 54 wk alphaA / BKO lenses.	"alphaA	48	54	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"alphaA	226	232	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""alphaA"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""alphaA"", ""start_span"": 226, ""end_span"": 232, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
[ 22] demonstrated, by targeted disruption of the mouse alphaA gene, that this protein was essential for the maintenance of lens transparency, possibly by maintaining the solubility of alphaB, or associated proteins, in the lens.	"mouse alphaA	50	62	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"alphaB	185	191	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""mouse alphaA"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""alphaB"", ""start_span"": 185, ""end_span"": 191, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This indicates that alphaA may play a greater role in maintaining the transparency of the lens then alphaB.	"alphaA	20	26	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"alphaB	100	106	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""alphaA"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""alphaB"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
None of these morphological differences have been reported in the single alphaA or alphaB knockout mice.	"alphaA	73	79	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"alphaB	83	89	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""alphaA"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""alphaB"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
It must be noted, however, that the alphaA / BKO mice also lack the HSPB2 gene product [ 23] and the contribution of this protein to normal lens morphology and functions should not be overlooked.	"alphaA	36	42	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"HSPB2	68	73	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""alphaA"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""HSPB2"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This process did not appear to have proceeded normally in lenses lacking alphaA and alphaB.	"alphaA	73	79	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"alphaB	84	90	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""alphaA"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""alphaB"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
"The morphological observations presented in this study demonstrate that fiber cells in lenses lacking alphaA and alphaB fail to elongate symmetrically from the bow region and therefore do not establish the typical "" onion skin "" conformation in which cells extend from the anterior epithelium to the posterior capsule."	"alphaA	102	108	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"alphaB	113	119	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""alphaA"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""alphaB"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The morphological differences in alphaA / BKO lenses, compared to age matched wild type lenses, were consistent with the hypothesis that alpha - crystallin plays an active role in the differentiation and growth of lens fiber cells.	"alphaA	33	39	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"alpha - crystallin	137	155	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""alphaA"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""alpha - crystallin"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 155, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Although this property may be a major contributor to the maintenance of lens clarity, the early changes in the alphaA / BKO lenses indicate a much broader cellular function for alpha - crystallin.	"alphaA	111	117	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"alpha - crystallin	177	195	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""alphaA"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""alpha - crystallin"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 195, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
During myogenic differentiation, mRNA for alphaB increases in conjunction with the induction of mRNA for myogenin, the earliest known event in myogenesis [ 29].	"alphaB	42	48	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"myogenin	105	113	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""alphaB"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""myogenin"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Both alphaA and alphaB can bind specifically to actin, both in vitro [ 13] and in vivo [ 14].	"alphaA	5	11	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"alphaB	16	22	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""alphaA"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""alphaB"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In the lens, alpha - crystallin also forms a complex with type III intermediate filament proteins and the lens - specific beaded filament proteins CP49 and CP115, which may be critical for proper filament assembly [ 16].	"CP49	147	151	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"CP115	156	161	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""CP49"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""CP115"", ""start_span"": 156, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
A model of tripeptidyl - peptidase I ( CLN2), a ubiquitous and highly conserved member of the sedolisin family of serine - carboxyl peptidases	"tripeptidyl - peptidase I	11	36	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"CLN2	39	43	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""tripeptidyl - peptidase I"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""CLN2"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Tripeptidyl - peptidase I, also known as CLN2, is a member of the family of sedolisins ( serine - carboxyl peptidases).	"Tripeptidyl - peptidase I	0	25	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"CLN2	41	45	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Tripeptidyl - peptidase I"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""CLN2"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Although the existence of tripeptidyl - peptidase I ( TPP - I) was first noted over 40 years ago [ 1], the structural and mechanistic basis of its activity has been largely misunderstood until quite recently.	"tripeptidyl - peptidase I	26	51	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"TPP - I	54	61	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""tripeptidyl - peptidase I"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""TPP - I"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The situation changed after it was shown that TPP - I is identical to an independently characterized enzyme named CLN2.	"TPP - I	46	53	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"CLN2	114	118	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""TPP - I"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""CLN2"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
More accurate placement of CLN2 within the context of a family of related enzymes became possible only after high - resolution crystal structures of two bacterial enzymes with a limited sequence similarity to CLN2, sedolisin and kumamolisin, became available [ 5 - 7].	"CLN2	27	31	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"CLN2	209	213	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""CLN2"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""CLN2"", ""start_span"": 209, ""end_span"": 213, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Exploiting the sequence similarity between CLN2, sedolisin, and kumamolisin ( Figure 4), we have now used the experimentally obtained structures of the latter two enzymes to form a new, homology - derived model of human CLN2.	"CLN2	43	47	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"human CLN2	214	224	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""CLN2"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""human CLN2"", ""start_span"": 214, ""end_span"": 224, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
An intriguing property of CLN2 is its reported ability to cleave collagen - related peptides [ 22].	"CLN2	26	30	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"collagen	65	73	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""CLN2"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""collagen"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
It has been recently reported that kumamolisin, and particularly a closely related protein from Alicyclobacillus sendaiensis ( kumamolisin - As) can efficiently cleave not only collagen - related peptides, but also native type I collagen [ 23].

The Zebrafish moonshine Gene Encodes Transcriptional Intermediary Factor 1 gamma, an Essential Regulator of Hematopoiesis	"Zebrafish moonshine	4	23	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Transcriptional Intermediary Factor 1 gamma	37	80	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Zebrafish moonshine"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Transcriptional Intermediary Factor 1 gamma"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Mutations in the zebrafish moonshine ( mon) gene specifically disrupt both embryonic and adult hematopoiesis, resulting in severe red blood cell aplasia.	"zebrafish moonshine	17	36	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mon	39	42	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""zebrafish moonshine"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mon"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
During development, hematopoietic progenitor cells in mon mutants fail to express normal levels of hematopoietic transcription factors, including gata1, and undergo apoptosis.	"mon	54	57	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"gata1	146	151	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""mon"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""gata1"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Surprisingly, a high level of zygotic tif1 gamma mRNA expression delineates ventral mesoderm during hematopoietic stem cell and progenitor formation prior to gata1 expression.	"tif1 gamma	38	48	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"gata1	158	163	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""tif1 gamma"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""gata1"", ""start_span"": 158, ""end_span"": 163, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In order to determine when the mon gene is required in development, we first examined hematopoietic gene expression and apoptosis in zebrafish homozygous mon mutant embryos.	"mon	31	34	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mon	154	157	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""mon"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mon"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The mon mutants initiate expression of gata1 in hematopoietic cells around the five - somite stage, similar to wild - type embryos ( data not shown); however, based on TUNEL staining, the differentiating erythroid cells undergo programmed cell death from the 12 - somite stage to 22 h postfertilization ( hpf) ( Figure 1A and 1B, arrows).	"mon	4	7	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"gata1	39	44	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""mon"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""gata1"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Mutations in mon are generally lethal by 10 to 14 d of development ( Ransom et al. 1996), although rare mon homozygous mutants ( approximately 1 in 500 bloodless embryos) of all tested alleles survive to adulthood.	"mon	13	16	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mon	104	107	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""mon"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mon"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Positional Cloning Identifies mon as the Zebrafish Ortholog of Mammalian TIF1 gamma	"mon	30	33	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"TIF1 gamma	73	83	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""mon"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""TIF1 gamma"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The coding sequence of mon is most similar to human TIF gamma ( Le Douarin et al. 1995; Friedman et al. 1996; Venturini et al. 1999), and the locations of exon boundaries are conserved between the zebrafish and human genes ( unpublished data).	"mon	23	26	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"human TIF gamma	46	61	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""mon"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""human TIF gamma"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Therefore, based on sequence similarity and chromosomal location, the zebrafish mon gene is the likely ortholog of the human TIF1 gamma gene.	"zebrafish mon	70	83	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"human TIF1 gamma	119	135	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""zebrafish mon"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""human TIF1 gamma"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This group of cells continues to express tif1 gamma and scl while it converges and forms the embryonic blood island ( Detrich et al. 1995).	"tif1 gamma	41	51	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"scl	56	59	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""tif1 gamma"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""scl"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, zebrafish tif1 gamma is specifically expressed in ventral mesoderm and putative hemangioblasts prior to and during the embryonic stages when hematopoietic progenitors are undergoing apoptosis in mon mutants.	"zebrafish tif1 gamma	6	26	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mon	201	204	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""zebrafish tif1 gamma"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mon"", ""start_span"": 201, ""end_span"": 204, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We also compared the expression of zebrafish mon to mouse Tif1 gamma ( Figure 4A and 4B).	"zebrafish mon	35	48	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mouse Tif1 gamma	52	68	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""zebrafish mon"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mouse Tif1 gamma"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Taken together these results strongly suggest that zebrafish mon and mouse Tif1 gamma are orthologs that function during hematopoiesis.	"zebrafish mon	51	64	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mouse Tif1 gamma	69	85	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""zebrafish mon"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mouse Tif1 gamma"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We next compared the embryonic expression pattern of tif1 alpha mRNA to tif1 gamma by in situ hybridization.	"tif1 alpha	53	63	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"tif1 gamma	72	82	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""tif1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""tif1 gamma"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Like mammalian TIF1 alpha ( Le Douarin et al. 1995; Niederreither et al. 1999), the predicted zebrafish tif1 gamma gene is broadly expressed ( see Figure 4A).	"TIF1 alpha	15	25	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"zebrafish tif1 gamma	94	114	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""TIF1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""zebrafish tif1 gamma"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
At five somites, zebrafish tif1 alpha does not display the relatively high expression in the horseshoe - shaped region of hematopoietic mesoderm seen with tif1 gamma.	"zebrafish tif1 alpha	17	37	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"tif1 gamma	155	165	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""zebrafish tif1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""tif1 gamma"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 165, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Therefore, tif1 alpha is coexpressed in the same cells with tif1 gamma and may therefore be available to form hetero - oligomers in vivo.	"tif1 alpha	11	21	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"tif1 gamma	60	70	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""tif1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""tif1 gamma"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

To further confirm that a mutation in the zebrafish tif1 gamma gene is responsible for the mon mutant phenotype we performed embryo rescue experiments ( Figure 5A; Table 1).

Overexpression of mon did not result in expanded blood cell numbers in wild - type embryos and was not toxic at doses that rescue the phenotype of mon mutants ( unpublished data).

In order to test this hypothesis, we transplanted wild - type adult zebrafish kidney marrow cells carrying a gata1: green fluorescent protein ( GFP) transgene into 48 - hpf mon mutant embryos ( Figure 5B; Table 2).

The gata1: GFP transgene makes use of the gata1 promoter to drive GFP expression and can thus be used to mark donor - derived erythroid cells ( Long et al. 1997).

Similar transplants of wild - type cells can fully rescue vlad tepes ( gata1) mutants ( Traver et al. 2003).

Immunofluorescence of mouse embryo fibroblast nuclei with the anti - Tif1 gamma antiserum demonstrates that Tif1 gamma is localized in small nuclear foci ( Figure 6A).

The nuclear foci that contain Tif1 gamma do not colocalize with two markers of heterochromatin, HP1 alpha protein and DAPI staining of DNA ( Figure 6A).

In two different murine erythroleukemia cell lines ( MEL and G1E), Tif1 gamma is also expressed in nuclear foci, and even though the overall Tif1 gamma protein level is reduced, this nuclear foci localization does not change with differentiation ( unpublished data).

Positional cloning was used to identify the mon gene, establishing a critical role for a transcriptional intermediary factor, Tif1 gamma, during hematopoietic development.

Our results strongly support the conclusion that we have positionally cloned the zebrafish mon gene correctly, and it is the ortholog of mammalian Tif1 gamma.

Zebrafish tif1 gamma is located in a region of zebrafish Chromosome 8 syntenic to the region of human Chromosome 1 containing TIF1 gamma.

We identified point mutations in tif1 gamma from three different alleles of mon that each result in premature stop codons and mRNA decay.

In addition, tif1 gamma / Tif1 gamma is highly expressed in hematopoietic cells throughout embryogenesis in both zebrafish and mouse ( see Figure 4).	"tif1 gamma	13	23	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Tif1 gamma	26	36	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""tif1 gamma"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Tif1 gamma"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
And as predicted, forced expression of wild - type tif1 gamma mRNA efficiently rescues hematopoiesis in mon mutants and does not perturb hematopoiesis in wild - type embryos ( see Figure 5).	"tif1 gamma	51	61	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mon	104	107	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""tif1 gamma"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mon"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Comparing available zebrafish and mammalian TIF1 - predicted amino acid sequences, it appears that the Tif1 gamma orthologs are the most highly conserved family members while the Tif1 alpha sequences are relatively more divergent.	"Tif1 gamma	103	113	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Tif1 alpha	179	189	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Tif1 gamma"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Tif1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 179, ""end_span"": 189, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Based on our analysis of zebrafish mon mutants, it is reasonable to predict that Tif1 gamma, the most evolutionarily conserved TIF1 family member, plays a similarly essential role in human and mouse hematopoiesis.	"zebrafish mon	25	38	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Tif1 gamma	81	91	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""zebrafish mon"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Tif1 gamma"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The expression of gata1 appears to initiate normally in the committed erythroid cells of mon mutants.

The expression of marker genes, including scl and gata2, characteristic of hematopoietic stem cells and primitive hematopoietic progenitors, are also not detected in the embryonic blood islands of mutants at 22 hpf.	"scl	42	45	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"gata2	50	55	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""scl"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""gata2"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Defective erythropoiesis and severe anemia were also observed in rare surviving homozygous mutant mon adults, demonstrating that tif1 gamma is also required in definitive hematopoiesis ( see Figure 2).	"mon	98	101	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"tif1 gamma	129	139	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""mon"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""tif1 gamma"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The zygotic phenotypes of mon mutants may not reveal the function of maternally inherited Tif1 gamma.

The present analysis of zygotic mon mutants provides data that are consistent with the conclusion that tif1 gamma is essential for erythropoiesis but do not rule out essential functions in other hematopoietic lineages.

In an effort to determine if there is a genetic relationship between mon and gata1, we tested their ability to rescue erythropoiesis.	"mon	69	72	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"gata1	77	82	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""mon"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""gata1"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We also tested for a direct interaction between Tif1 gamma and Gata1 proteins by coimmunoprecipitation and yeast two - hybrid assays and found no association ( unpublished data).

Although the mutations in each of these genes arrest cells at a similar stage of development, our results suggest that gata1 and tif1 gamma act independently.	"gata1	119	124	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"tif1 gamma	129	139	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""gata1"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""tif1 gamma"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This does not rule out the possibility that parallel genetic pathways involving gata1 and tif1 gamma, operating together, regulate gene transcription within blood cells.	"gata1	80	85	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"tif1 gamma	90	100	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""gata1"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""tif1 gamma"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
These studies indicate that TIF1 alpha and TIF1 beta act as scaffolds that link different classes of DNA - binding proteins and chromatin - associated proteins into larger regulatory complexes.

Tif1 gamma is detected within nuclear foci ( see Figure 6), which, based on our analysis, do not appear to correspond to several types of previously described nuclear bodies, including PML bodies.

It will be important to determine the identity of Tif1 gamma - interacting proteins in nuclear foci and establish how they function with Tif1 gamma to regulate blood cell development.

To test this, we conducted a genome - wide scan analysis of two large cohorts of ( 129 x C57BL / 6) F2 mice, one of which carried a mutation in the serum amyloid P component gene ( Apcs).

In addition, sequence analysis of the entire Apcs coding region in both strains failed to identify any coding sequence polymorphisms in the Apcs gene ( data not shown), indicating that a structural variant of the protein is unlikely to be the explanation for our findings.

Female Chromosome 1 congenic mice ( C57BL / 6. 129 [ D1Mit105 - 223]), together with sex - matched Apcs - / - mice backcrossed onto C57BL / 6 for ten generations ( C57BL / 6.

In the C57BL / 6. Apcs - / - mice, the 129 genome around the Apcs locus was mapped as a stretch of approximately 17 cM, positioned from 87. 9 cM ( D1Mit15) to 105 cM ( D1Mit17).

However, in contrast to the serological data, the histological assessment of the kidneys showed evidence of markedly increased glomerulonephritis in the C57BL / 6. Apcs - / - compared to both control groups ( Figure 9), suggesting that the lack of Apcs, when combined with other C57BL / 6 susceptibility alleles, can induce the development of severe renal damage.

By comparing this Chromosome 1 congenic strain with matched congenic mice lacking the Apcs gene, we demonstrated that serum amyloid P component deficiency influences the severity of glomerulonephritis, but is not the prime mover in the induction of anti - nuclear autoimmunity, contrary to our own original interpretation of our data ( Bickerstaff et al. 1999).

Although these findings demonstrate that Apcs is not implicated in the processing of autoantigens, as it had previously been suggested, they indicate that Apcs might still play an important protective role in lupus nephritis.

In support of this, the expression of the human C - reactive protein, an acute - phase protein closely related to Apcs, has been shown to delay the onset and severity of lupus nephritis in the NZB / W strain by preventing the deposition of immune complexes in the renal cortex ( Szalai et al. 2003).

In the C57BL / 6. Apcs - / - mice ( backcrossed onto C57BL / 6 for ten generations), the 129 genome around the Apcs locus was mapped as a segment from 87. 9 cM ( D1Mit15) to 105 cM ( D1Mit17).

Samples were screened at a 1: 100 dilution, and the results were expressed in arbitrary ELISA units ( AEUs) relative to a standard positive sample ( derived from an MRL / Mp. lpr / lpr mouse), which was assigned a value of 100.

The phosphatidylserine receptor ( Ptdsr) on phagocytes has been implicated in the recognition and engulfment of apoptotic cells and in anti - inflammatory signaling.

To determine the biological function of the phosphatidylserine receptor in vivo, we inactivated the Ptdsr gene in the mouse.

A comprehensive investigation of apoptotic cell clearance in vivo and in vitro demonstrated that engulfment of apoptotic cells was normal in Ptdsr knockout mice, but Ptdsr - deficient macrophages were impaired in pro - and anti - inflammatory cytokine signaling after stimulation with apoptotic cells or with lipopolysaccharide.

The best - characterized molecule so far that binds PS in a stereo - specific manner is the phosphatidylserine receptor ( Ptdsr) [ 26].

A perinatally lethal phenotype was observed in Ptdsr - knockout mice, and Ptdsr - deficient embryos displayed multiple defects in tissue and organ differentiation.

To investigate in vivo the functions of the phosphatidylserine receptor Ptdsr, we generated a null allele in the mouse by gene targeting ( Figure 1a, 1b, 1c).

In contrast to previously described Ptdsr - knockout mice [ 31, 32], we used Bruce4 embryonic stem ( ES) cells for gene targeting [ 33], thus generating a Ptdsr - null allele in a pure, isogenic C57BL / 6J genetic background.

Ptdsr + / - mice were intercrossed to generate homozygous Ptdsr - deficient mice.

The absence of Ptdsr expression in Ptdsr - / - embryos was confirmed by RT - PCR ( data not shown), and by northern and western blotting analyses ( Figure 1d, e).

The affected animals displayed a complete unilateral or bilateral absence of the eyes ( Table 1) that was never detected in Ptdsr + / + or Ptdsr + / - littermates.

Because we were able to recover Ptdsr - / - embryos until E18. 5, we investigated whether Ptdsr - knockout mice could be born alive.

Analysis by RT - PCR ( data not shown) showed that Ptdsr is expressed early in development, because we were able to detect Ptdsr transcripts in ES cells and embryos at all developmental stages.

These developmental stages were chosen so as to investigate Ptdsr expression in affected organs prior to the onset of pathological malformations in Ptdsr - / - embryos.

We carefully investigated whether Ptdsr is expressed from E10. 5 to E12. 5 in the developing kidney and lungs, but no expression could be detected indicating that Ptdsr expression is required only at later stages in the development of these organs ( see below).	"Ptdsr	34	39	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Ptdsr	163	168	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 163, ""end_span"": 168, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
At E18. 5 ( Figure 4c, g) and in neonatal animals ( postnatal day P0; Figure 4d, h), the differences in retinal differentiation between Ptdsr + / + and Ptdsr - / - mice were still evident, but the size reduction of the retinal layers was less pronounced in the knockout mice.

In summary, we observed a wide range of ocular malformations in Ptdsr - deficient mice that ranged from differentiation defects in retinal cell layers ( for example, the inner granular layer) in mildly affected homozygotes to anophthalmia in severely affected Ptdsr - / - mice that was associated with induction of ectopic eye structures in nasal cavities.

We compared the pattern of interdigital cell death in fore and hind limb buds from Ptdsr - / - ( n = 3) and Ptdsr + / + ( n = 3) mice at E12. 5 and E13. 5.

Starting at E12. 5, we analyzed and compared the number and distribution of aCasp3 - positive cells in over 140 serial sections of three wild - type and six Ptdsr - / - embryos in consecutive and corresponding sections.	"aCasp3	76	82	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Ptdsr	157	162	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""aCasp3"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 162, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The same was true for the developing kidney: apoptotic cells were present in Ptdsr + / + and Ptdsr - / - embryos, in limited numbers, but we failed to detect any differences in the number of apoptotic cells between the genotypes ( Figure 6c, 6g).	"Ptdsr	77	82	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Ptdsr	93	98	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
As already observed at E12. 5, analysis of aCasp3 - stained sections of the developing thymus, heart, diaphragm, genital ridge, eyes and retina convincingly showed that there was no impairment in apoptotic cell removal in Ptdsr - / - mice.

Moreover, because Li and colleagues [ 31] reported impaired clearance of dead cells during lung development in Ptdsr - deficient mice, we examined the rate of apoptosis induction and cell clearance in our Ptdsr - knockout mice in the lung.

In addition, there were no differences in the number or distribution of apoptotic cells in Ptdsr - / - and Ptdsr + / + mice.

To analyze whether macrophages are recruited into areas where apoptosis is prominent during embryogenesis, we stained consecutive serial sections either with the macrophage surface marker F4 / 80 or with aCasp3.

Analysis of phagocytosis rates by flow cytometric analysis ( FACS) revealed no differences in the efficacy of apoptotic cell uptake between Ptdsr - / - and Ptdsr + / + macrophages and demonstrated no differences in apoptotic cell engulfment between selected time points ( data not shown).	"Ptdsr	140	145	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Ptdsr	156	161	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 156, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Analysis was done independently by three investigators who were not aware of macrophage genotypes ( Ptdsr - / - or Ptdsr + / +).

Ptdsr - / - macrophages produced significantly less TNF - alpha than did wild - type macrophages.

To analyze whether TNF - alpha release by Ptdsr - / - macrophages can be affected by engulfment of apoptotic cells, we stimulated FLDMs with LPS, apoptotic cells or both.	"TNF - alpha	19	30	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Ptdsr	42	47	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""TNF - alpha"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Moreover, the double stimulation demonstrated that the LPS - induced TNF - alpha release by Ptdsr - / - macrophages could be inhibited by co - administration of apoptotic cells to an extent comparable to that seen in wild - type macrophages.	"TNF - alpha	69	80	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Ptdsr	92	97	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""TNF - alpha"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Similar results were obtained when other pro - inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin - 6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein - 1, were analyzed ( data not shown).	"interleukin - 6	79	94	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"monocyte chemoattractant protein - 1	99	135	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""interleukin - 6"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""monocyte chemoattractant protein - 1"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Ptdsr - deficiency does, however, affect the overall release of pro - and anti - inflammatory cytokines after stimulation with LPS and after double treatment with LPS and apoptotic cells, indicating that Ptdsr - deficient macrophages have a reduced capacity to produce or secrete pro - and anti - inflammatory cytokines.	"Ptdsr	0	5	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Ptdsr	204	209	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 204, ""end_span"": 209, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In this study, we have generated a null mutation in the phosphatidylserine receptor ( Ptdsr) gene in C57BL / 6J mice.

The ablation of Ptdsr function results in perinatal lethality in all cases, but there are interesting differences in severity or expressivities of phenotypes among the different Ptdsr - deficient mouse lines.

In the Ptdsr - knockout mouse line reported here, growth retardation started from E12. 5 onwards and was associated with delayed differentiation in several organs in which Ptdsr is expressed either during embryogenesis or later in adulthood.

Finally, because the lungs of Ptdsr - / - neonates were almost fully expanded and appeared normal in structure in comparison to wild - type littermates, it is highly unlikely that Ptdsr mutants die of respiratory lung failure.

The frequently observed subcutaneous edema of various extents in Ptdsr - deficient homozygotes gave us a hint that Ptdsr - deficiency and lethality might be associated with cardiovascular problems.

This suggests that Ptdsr is involved in the regulation of differentiation processes within forebrain regions, and that ablation of Ptdsr function might secondarily affect early eye formation.

Other studies that connect the postnatal elimination of apoptotic photoreceptor cells to Ptdsr - mediated macrophage engulfment [ 43] should be interpreted with extreme caution as these studies were based on the monoclonal anti - Ptdsr antibody mAb 217G8E9 [ 26, 43] ( see below).

In summary, our studies demonstrate that Ptdsr is required for normal tissue differentiation, especially during the mid - gestation period when we observed the most severe differentiation delays in several organs of Ptdsr - knockout mice.

Additional studies with conditionally targeted Ptdsr - deficient mice are required to investigate the role of spatial and temporal Ptdsr expression and function during tissue differentiation.

Investigation of apoptotic cell clearance in vivo in Ptdsr - / - embryos conclusively showed that removal of apoptotic cells is not compromised by ablation of Ptdsr function.

Comparative analysis of ten different tissues and organs in Ptdsr + / + and Ptdsr - / - animals at several stages of embryonic development and in neonates failed to identify impaired uptake of apoptotic cells at any time during development.

This antibody was used in Ptdsr binding and blocking experiments, as well as in subcellular localization studies, which led to the conclusion that Ptdsr is a transmembrane receptor critical for signal transduction at the engulfment interface.

Mutations in either Gdf5 or the closely related Gdf6 gene also block formation of joints at specific locations, providing strong evidence that these molecules are essential for the joint formation process ( Storm et al. 1994; Settle et al. 2003).

However, mutations in Bmp2 or Bmp4 cause early embryonic lethality, making it difficult to test their role in joint formation ( Winnier et al. 1995; Zhang and Bradley 1996).

Null mutations in the Bmpr1b gene produce viable mice with defects in bone and joint formation that closely resemble those seen in mice missing Gdf5 ( Storm and Kingsley 1996; Baur et al. 2000; Yi et al. 2000).

Null mutations in Bmpr1a cause early embryonic lethality, with defects in gastrulation similar to those seen in mice with mutations in Bmp4 ( Mishina et al. 1995; Winnier et al. 1995).

Here we take advantage of the tissue - specific expression pattern of the Gdf5 gene to engineer a Cre / loxP system ( Nagy 2000), Gdf5 - Cre, that can be used to remove or ectopically express genes in joints.

Gdf5 - Cre recombination bypasses the early embryonic lethality of null mutations in Bmpr1a, and shows that this receptor is required for early joint formation at some locations and for initiation of programmed cell death in webbing between digits.

These experiments suggest that BMP signaling is required for normal maintenance of postnatal articular cartilage, and that modulation of the BMP signaling pathway may play an important role in joint disease.

Interestingly, HPLAP expression in the Gdf5 - Cre transgenic GAC ( A) line used for all subsequent breeding experiments was seen to precede LACZ expression during successive development of joints in the digits ( Figure 1C) ( unpublished data).

Adult expression patterns of the Gdf5 gene are not as well characterized, but Gdf5 expression has previously been detected in adult articular cartilage using both RT - PCR and immunocytochemistry ( Chang et al. 1994; Erlacher et al. 1998; Bobacz et al. 2002).

Gdf5 - Cre transgenic mice were bred to animals carrying a conditional floxed allele of the Bmpr1a locus ( Mishina et al. 2002), usually in the presence of the R26R reporter allele to facilitate simultaneous visualization of Cre - mediated recombination patterns ( see typical cross in Figure 3).

Interdigital mesenchyme is normally eliminated by apoptosis during embryonic development, a process that can be stimulated by BMP beads, inhibited by Noggin, or blocked by overexpression of dominant - negative BMP receptors ( Garcia - Martinez et al. 1993; Yokouchi et al. 1996; Zou and Niswander 1996; Guha et al. 2002).

These data suggest that regional loss of BMPR1A receptor signaling blocks programmed cell death in interdigital mesenchyme, and that the recombined cells survive and proliferate in the absence of BMPR1A signaling.

To determine whether articular cells were properly specified in mutants, we also analyzed expression of Matrilin - 4 ( Mat4), a gene expressed specifically in the periarticular and perichondral regions of developing joints ( Klatt et al. 2001).

Notably, despite reduced expression of many cartilage matrix marker genes in Bmpr1a mutant mice, the SOX9 protein was present at normal levels in articular regions at all stages examined, including newborn, 2 - wk - old, 7 - wk - old, and 9 - mo - old mice ( Figure 5N and 5S) ( unpublished data).

Instead, increased expression of Col10a1 was seen in a zone of largely LACZ - negative cells stretching from the cartilage adjacent to the ossification front ( where Col10a1 is normally expressed in maturing cartilage cells), toward the regions where surface articular cartilage was severely eroded or missing ( Figure 6A and 6B, arrowheads).

The Gdf5 - Cre recombination system bypasses the early embryonic lethality of Bmpr1a mutations, and provides important new information about the role of this receptor in limb and skeletal development.

The three major limb phenotypes revealed by eliminating Bmpr1a with Gdf5 - driven Cre include webbing between digits, lack of joint formation at specific locations in the ankle, and failure to maintain articular cartilage after birth, resulting in severe arthritis.

Previous studies have shown that manipulation of BMP signaling alters interdigital apoptosis during development of the limb, but no experiment has identified a specific member of the BMP signaling pathway that is required for this process ( Yokouchi et al. 1996; Zou and Niswander 1996; Zou et al. 1997; Guha et al. 2002).

Our new loss - of - function data confirm that BMP signaling is required for interdigital apoptosis and suggests that Bmpr1a is a critical component for mediating this signal.

The joint defects associated with multiple components of the BMP pathway provide strong evidence that BMP signaling is required for early stages of joint formation at some anatomical locations.

However, several of the most prominent structural components of cartilage matrix fail to be maintained in mutant animals, resulting in decreased synthesis of Col2a1, Agg, and proteoglycans.

It is interesting that the SOX9 transcription factor continues to be expressed in mutant cartilage despite loss of Col2a1, a direct target of this transcription factor ( Bell et al. 1997; Lefebvre et al. 1997).

These models are consistent with the ability of BMP2 to both increase PKA activity and induce expression of Sox6 in tissue culture cells ( Lee and Chuong 1997; Fernandez - Lloris et al. 2003).

Furthermore, null mutations in L - Sox5 or Sox - 6 cause lethality at or soon after birth, and no effect on cartilage maintenance has been reported ( Smits et al. 2001).

However, it seems likely that these or other processes regulated by BMP signaling cooperate with SOX9 to induce target genes in articular cartilage.

Both manipulations should disrupt TGF beta rather than BMP signaling, and both manipulations cause articular cartilage to hypertrophy and be replaced by bone.

In contrast, tissue remains in mutants at this location, primarily derived from cells that have undergone Gdf5 - Cre - mediated recombination that inactivates Bmpr1a function and activates expression of LACZ ( H).

This attraction was not due to survival support of NT - 3 because Bax null ganglia displayed the same chemoattraction ( Figure 5C; n = 16).

In the presence of TrkC - Fc the chemoattraction was completely blocked, demonstrating that the effect we see is specific for NT - 3.

Next, we set up E13 DRG spinal cord explant cultures using NT - 3 - loaded beads placed at the midline at mid - spinal cord level as an ectopic NT - 3 source ( n = 15).

Axons that normally enter the gray matter through dorsal spinal cord grow towards the midline when presented with a localized NT - 3 source, and new axon growth towards the NT - 3 bead is initiated from DRGs, entering the spinal cord at ectopic loci at lateral mid - spinal cord ( Figure 6G).

( 1997) argue that while central sensory axons may still navigate properly in the absence of NT - 3, ectopic expression of NT - 3 disrupts their targeting.

Recently, another member of the neurotrophin family, BDNF, has been suggested to act as a chemoattractant for sensory axons innervating ear ( Tessarollo et al. 2004).

Ectopic NT - 3 supplied using osmotic pumps and adenovirus - mediated expression induce sensory axon growth during regeneration ( Zhang et al. 1998, Bradbury et al. 1999, Oudega et al. 1999, Ramer et al. 2002), and induce axonal plasticity of corticospinal axons in injured adult spinal cord ( Zhou et al. 2003), where the sprouting axons from the intact site cross the midline towards the NT - 3 source on the lesion side of the spinal cord.

Previously, normal motor neuron innervation was rescued in NT - 3 KO animals by over - expressing NT - 3 selectively in their muscles ( Wright et al. 1997).	"NT - 3	59	65	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"NT - 3	98	104	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""NT - 3"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""NT - 3"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
It appears that peripheral NT - 3 alone is sufficient for rescuing proprioceptive neurons in NT - 3 KO animals and proper axonal pathfinding in the spinal cord.	"NT - 3	27	33	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"NT - 3	93	99	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""NT - 3"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""NT - 3"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
( 2003) reported their observations on Bax / NT - 3 double KO mice they bred.

We have examined nine Bax / NT - 3 double KO cases, and often incomplete DiI labeling gives the impression that there are no axons reaching the ventral spinal cord.

( 2000) reported that members of the Ets family of transcription factors, Er81 and Pea3, are expressed by DRG neurons as well as motor neurons and their target muscle fibers.

They provide evidence that NT - 3 induces Er81 expression in DRG explants in vitro.

However, there is no evidence showing that NT - 3 mRNA or protein expressed in the ventral spinal cord is exclusively from motor neurons, and there are no available data indicating that in islet2DTA mice, NT - 3 expression in the ventral spinal cord is abolished ( Yang et al. 2001; Pun et al. 2002).

Our present results, along with those from transgenic mice with NT - 3 over - expression in ectopic regions of the spinal cord ( Ringstedt et al. 1997), argue for a role of NT - 3 in chemoattractant axon guidance of proprioceptive axons in the spinal cord.

NT - 3 is capable of attracting axons along distances of up to 1 mm in collagen gel matrix, covering the physiological range it needs to attract axons during development.

Previous studies with exogenous or local applications of NT - 3 to developing primary sensory axons have indicated that this neurotrophin can attract and induce axonal branching ( Ulup i nar et al. 2000; O zdinler and Erzurumlu 2001, O zdinler et al. 2004).

Slit2 does not cause repulsion of NT - 3 - responsive DRG axons in vitro ( Nguyen Ba - Charvet et al. 2001), but causes ectopic branching and arborization of trigeminal axons in the brainstem ( O zdinler and Erzurumlu 2002).

At an optimum concentration of DNase I, strong cleavages were detected on the 21 bp duplex regions at both ends of the substrates, whereas weaker cleavages were detected on the central single - stranded region, consistent with preference of DNase I to double - stranded DNA.

With the Bub66 / T - rich substrate, strong protection was detected on the entire single - stranded regions of both top and bottom strands with increasing concentration of Mcm4 / 6 / 7, consistent with high affinity of Mcm4 / 6 / 7 to T - rich bubble sequences ( Figure 1A).

This suggests that Mcm4 / 6 / 7 may bind to a replication bubble substrate with a 2 - fold symmetry as a double hexamer ( Figure 1A, see the lower scheme), in a manner similar to SV40 T - antigen ( 21).

In gel shift assays, Mcm4 / 6 / 7 bound to these Y - fork substrates with identical affinity ( Figure 8A), consistent with the notion that the Mcm4 / 6 / 7 binds to single - stranded tails.

However, in DNA helicase assays, T - fork / ( C: G) 49 was hardly displaced by Mcm4 / 6 / 7, but was readily displaced by SV40 T - antigen DNA helicase ( Figure 8B).

The results in this report indicate that helicase action of Mcm4 / 6 / 7 on synthetic bubbles may depend on the presence of an unpaired region of sufficient length ( at least 40 nt), which may permit assembly of a double - hexameric complex on the substrate DNA, similar to SV40 T - antigen protein ( Figure 2A) ( 21).

Although we cannot totally exclude the possibility that one Mcm4 / 6 / 7 hexamer at each fork unwinds the duplex independently, ring - shaped structures of mouse and archea MCM, as revealed by electron microscopy, bear much similarity to the recently solved structure of the SV40 large T - antigen ( 4, 6), and are in favor of the double - hexameric structure of mouse Mcm on a bubble DNA.

The ability of the mouse Mcm4 / 6 / 7 to unwind 3 ' - extension is shared by the archaeal Mcm helicase but not by Mcm4 / 6 / 7 from S. pombe and S. cerevisiae ( 14, 26, 27).

This, in conjunction with the low processivity of Mcm4 / 6 / 7 helicase, strongly indicates that the replicative helicase at the replication forks would require more than Mcm4 / 6 / 7 complex.

Huntingtin, the HD gene encoded protein mutated by polyglutamine expansion in Huntington ' s disease, is required in extraembryonic tissues for proper gastrulation, implicating its activities in nutrition or patterning of the developing embryo.

Huntington ' s disease ( HD) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by CAG repeats in the HD locus that extend a polyglutamine tract in a ubiquitous HEAT domain protein called huntingtin [ 1].

This observation strongly suggests that the striatal cell specificity of the polyglutamine expansion in the context of huntingtin must be determined by some aspect of huntingtin ' s structure, subcellular location or activities [ 2].

Huntingtin ' s large number of diverse cytoplasmic and nuclear protein binding partners strongly suggest that huntingtin may participate in a variety of cellular processes that range from trafficking of growth factor complexes to gene transcription ( reviewed in [ 5, 8, 9].

However, despite the potential importance of huntingtin ' s normal function to our understanding of how the dominant polyglutamine mutation causes HD pathology, huntingtin ' s precise molecular and cellular activities have not been defined.

Therefore, we, and others, set out to discover huntingtin ' s essential activities by studying the effects of huntingtin deficiency in the mouse.

Complete lack of huntingtin results in developmental arrest during gastrulation, while severe reduction of huntingtin levels results in abnormal neurogenesis and perinatal lethality [ 15].

Importantly, the expression of huntingtin only in extraembryonic tissues in chimeras rescues this gastrulation phenotype, suggesting that huntingtin is required only in cells of the extraembryonic lineage and acts in a cell non - autonomous manner at this stage [ 16].

However, huntingtin deficient embryos do not display obvious visceral endoderm defects, with the notable exception of compromised iron transport in later stage mutants, although iron uptake is undisturbed [ 16] and endocytosis is not impaired in huntingtin deficient embryos or embryonic stem cells [ 16, 18].

By the same token, huntingtin shuttles through the nucleus, where it is required for proper nuclear localization of its transcription factor partners, suggesting that huntingtin may play a role in transcription cascades in extraembryonic tissues that pattern the embryo [ 18].

Since extraembryonic tissues supply nutrients to the developing embryo, we tested the possibility that huntingtin deficiency may perturb this function by performing RT - PCR analysis to examine the expression of a panel of ' nutritive ' genes in E7. 5 wild - type and Hdhex4 / 5 / Hdhex4 / 5 huntingtin deficient embryos.

To examine definitive endoderm formation, the expression of Hnf3 beta ( FoxA2) in mutant and wild - type embryos was analyzed.

Therefore, huntingtin deficiency does not greatly affect Hnf3 beta regulation or the reorganization of the visceral endoderm.

Extraembryonic mesoderm, derived from the proximal streak, does not normally express T or Evx1 in wild - type embryos [ 22].

Therefore, the inappropriate expression of T and Evx1, the shortened primitive streak, and the absence of a morphological node, all suggest that the anterior primitive streak is deficient in the mutant embryos.

In huntingtin deficient mutants, Wnt3a is induced in the proximal streak ( Fig. 2G, H), confirming stage appropriate posterior development, in contrast to the absence of anterior head folds.

Nodal, a member of the Tgf beta family of secreted molecules is required for the formation and maintenance of the primitive streak and induction of the AVE [ 25 - 27].

Nodal expression was assessed in Hdhex4 / 5 / Hdhex4 / 5 embryos heterozygous for the Ndl lac Z allele [ 28, 29].

Notably, heterozygous loss of nodal does not alter the Hdhex4 / 5 / Hdhex4 / 5 phenotype, as determined by morphology of Hdhex4 / 5 / Hdhex4 / 5: Ndllacz / Ndl + embryos compared with Hdhex4 / 5 / Hdhex4 / 5 embryos ( data not shown).

The tight node expression of Nodal in normal embryos ( C) is lost in mutant embryos ( D), consistent with the loss of a morphological node in the absence of huntingtin.

Hdhex4 / 5 / Hdhex4 / 5 embryos also fail to restrict the expression of goosecoid ( Gsc).

Similarly, the expression of Pem transcripts is maintained in mutant embryos ( D) similar to normal embryos ( C), although Pem is expressed in the abnormal lopsided overhang of visceral endoderm over the anterior of the mutant embryos.

Whole mount staining of E7. 5 mutant and wild - type embryos for alkaline phosphatase activity reveals that PCGs form in Hdhex4 / 5 / Hdhex4 / 5 embryos, suggesting that Bmp4 signaling is functional in the absence of huntingtin ( Fig. 4G, H).

In Hdhex4 / 5 / Hdhex4 / 5 embryos, both Dkk1 ( Fig. 4I, J) and Lefty1 ( Fig. 4K, L) are expressed normally in the AVE as compared with wild - type embryos.

However, Dkk - 1 levels appear to be slightly increased in Hdhex4 / 5 / Hdhex4 / 5 embryos, although the pattern of Dkk - 1 expression remains unchanged and this increase may just reflect the same amount of expression in a smaller area.

Instead, our results reveal that huntingtin is required for normal anterior streak formation and the consequent production of paraxial mesoderm, with a previously unrecognized role for huntingtin in the proper extinction of transiently and / or dynamically expressed genes.

Furthermore, the expression of T and Evx1 in the extraembryonic mesoderm of mutant embryos is not a feature of wild - type embryos, even at earlier stages.

Moreover, extraembryonic Bmp4 signaling is not impaired in the absence of huntingtin, as the induction of PCGs in mutant embryos is normal, implying proper transport and secretion of the appropriate extraembryonic signals.	"Bmp4	25	29	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"huntingtin	74	84	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Bmp4"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""huntingtin"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Both Nodal and Fgf8, important growth factors required for normal development of the epiblast, are tightly regulated during gastrulation.

This conclusion is consistent with the finding that severely reduced levels of huntingtin, from a hypomorphic Hdh allele, lead to abnormal brains later in embryonic development [ 15].

Interestingly, Eed protein is also required for proper trophoblast development and normal maintenance of imprinted X - inactivation and genomic imprinting [ 47 - 49], suggesting that these activities warrant investigation in huntingtin deficient embryos.

In HD patients and in accurate genetic replicas, HD CAG knock - in mice, the dominant mutation specifically affects the major population of neurons in the striatum, without impairing huntingtin ' s essential activities in embryonic development [ 50 - 53].

The quest to understand the HD mechanism, therefore, is aimed at delineating the huntingtin activity that may explain the striatal cell specificity of the polyglutamine mutant version of huntingtin.

Now, our finding that huntingtin can be absolutely necessary for the appropriate regulation of genes with dynamic expression patterns in vivo, provides a compelling reason to elucidate the cellular machinery that is necessary for huntingtin mediated gene regulation.	"huntingtin	22	32	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"huntingtin	230	240	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""huntingtin"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""huntingtin"", ""start_span"": 230, ""end_span"": 240, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Knowledge of the molecular basis of these changes in huntingtin deficient embryos should facilitate the identification of the cellular pathways that are dependent on huntingtin activities.

Congenital NDI is caused by mutations in either the water channel, AQP2, or in the receptor, AVPR2.

Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus ( NDI) is a disease characterized by excessive urination and thirst, despite normal production of the antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin ( AVP) [ 1].

The inherited forms are either X - linked as a consequence of mutation of the Avpr2 gene [ 2], or autosomal due to mutation of the Aqp2 gene [ 3].

Aquaporin - 2 ( AQP2) is a pore - forming protein belonging to a family of water channels [ 4], and it is expressed in collecting - duct principal cells in the kidney [ 5].

Furthermore these proteins can also be differentially targeted to distinct regions of the PM; for example, AQP2 is routed to the apical membrane of cells surrounding the collecting duct, whereas other aquaporins ( AQP3 or 4) are inserted into the basolateral face.	"AQP2	107	111	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"AQP3	214	218	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""AQP2"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""AQP3"", ""start_span"": 214, ""end_span"": 218, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
For this process to occur, AVP binds its receptor, AVPR2, on the basolateral face of the collecting duct cells, leading to a rise in intracellular cAMP, ultimately resulting in phosphorylation of AQP2 at serine 256 by cAMP - dependent protein kinase [ 9] and its redistribution to the plasma membrane.

The importance of AQP2 redistribution has been highlighted by functional characterization of Aqp2 mutations resulting in severe NDI in humans [ 3, 10].

In an attempt to recapitulate human NDI, mice have been generated with mutations in Aqp2 and Avpr2 [ 15, 18].

Severe hydronephrosis has previously been observed in double Aqp1 / Aqp3 knock - out mice [ 17], and appears at 6 wk.

In humans, recessive alleles of Aqp2 are postulated to cause NDI because they do not properly translocate to the apical cell surface in response to AVP.

In kidneys taken from mutant animals, however, AQP2 was distributed randomly throughout the cell in the basal state ( Figure 4A, third row), while AQP3 ( green) appropriately localized to the basolateral surface [ 23].

It has also been shown that wild - type AQP2 protein can rescue a translocation - defective mutant protein, AQP2 - P262L, when the two are coexpressed in MDCK cells [ 25].

On top of these, we transiently transfected AQP2 - GFP or AQP2 - F204V - GFP expression constructs.

AQP2 - GFP localized to the apical surface upon forskolin stimulation whether it was transiently transfected into vector - only cells ( Figure 5C, upper left images) or into wild - type AQP2 cells ( Figure 5C, upper right).	"AQP2	0	4	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"AQP2	186	190	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""AQP2"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""AQP2"", ""start_span"": 186, ""end_span"": 190, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
When expressed in wild - type AQP2 cells, however, AQP2 - F204V - GFP localized to the apical surface to varying degrees ( Figure 5C, lower right images [ i - iii]).

The next two show expression of both the stable wild - type AQP2 and the transient AQP2 - F204V - GFP.

In cell ( ii), localization of wild - type AQP2 was indistinguishable from AQP2 - F204V - GFP; both were apical upon forskolin stimulation.

Generally, the localization of AQP2 - F204V - GFP was clearly more apical when wild - type AQP2 was also expressed.

AQP2 - F204V - GFP is expressed approximately equally in both cell lines ( Figure 5D, total cells), but is biotinylated only when wild - type AQP2 is also expressed ( Figure 5D, surface biotinylated).

Since only cell surface proteins are accessible to biotin, these results indicate that AQP2 - F204V is transported to the cell surface when wild - type AQP2 is present, but not on its own.

The fact that our mice survive shows either that AQP2 - F204V possesses some residual water transporting ability or that there are AVP - independent pathways for water reabsorption.

Colocalization of AQP2 - F204V with the ER protein calnexin in transfected MDCK cells shows that, while most of the mutant protein is trapped in the ER, some does progress beyond the ER.

To generate stable MDCK cell lines, cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen) and the pcDNA3. 1 expression constructs ( containing wild - type AQP2, AQP2 - F204V, or no insert) and selected with 900 mu g / ml G418 ( Sigma - Aldrich).

AMPAR modification was obtained by depletion of the GluR - B subunit or expression of unedited GluR - B ( Q), both leading to increased Ca2 + permeability of AMPARs.	"GluR - B subunit	52	68	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"GluR - B	95	103	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B subunit"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Notably, the normally low Ca2 + permeability of AMPA channels in principal neurons is solely mediated by GluR - B, due to a unique arginine residue ( R587) in the functionally critical glutamine / arginine ( Q / R) site of the pore - forming segment M2 [ 44, 47, 48], resulting from RNA editing of GluR - B pre - mRNA ( [ 49]; reviewed in [ 50]).	"GluR - B	105	113	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"GluR - B	298	306	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 298, ""end_span"": 306, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Hence, either GluR - B deficiency, or the expression of Q / R site - unedited GluR - B with a glutamine residue at the critical channel site, leads to increased Ca2 + permeability of AMPA channels, as amply demonstrated in gene - targeted mice [ 51, 53, 58, 60].

Thus, the absence of GluR - B, or the expression of GluR - B ( Q) in the olfactory bulb, may generate increased inhibition in mitral cells.

Moreover, the ablation of GluR - B, but also changes in the extent of Q / R site editing of GluR - B, can alter the strength of excitatory synaptic transmission in the genetically addressed neuronal populations [ 51, 58, 60], thus potentially shifting the balance of excitatory and inhibitory transmission in the affected circuits.

"Although such "" mosaic "" expression is usually undesired, here we took advantage of it by ablating GluR - B via gene - targeted, floxed GluR - B alleles with the help of a transgenic mouse line with variegated Cre expression in forebrain."

By correlating GluR - B levels in olfaction - related brain regions with quantitative behavioral data, we investigated the dependence on GluR - B of olfactory discrimination and memory.

"To explore the role of fast excitatory neurotransmission carried by GluR - B - containing AMPA channels in olfactory processes, we first analyzed mice that express part of the GluR - B population in a Q / R site - unedited form ( Figure 1A; termed "" GluR - B Delta ECS: FB ""; see also [ 58])."

These mice carry, in addition to a wild - type GluR - B allele, a gene - targeted GluR - Bneo allele in which the intronic sequence critical for GluR - B pre - mRNA editing at the Q / R site is replaced by a floxed TK - neo gene, which severely reduces splicing of the modified intron and hence attenuates the expression of the GluR - Bneo allele [ 60].

In quantitative immunoblot analyses, we found GluR - B levels reduced to 28 +/- 7%, 29 +/- 8%, and 52 +/- 9% ( +/- SEM; n = 10) in the hippocampus, cortical areas, and olfactory bulb, respectively, relative to GluR - B levels in GluR - B2lox littermate controls.

In addition, in contrast to the complete GluR - B knockouts, mice with forebrain - specific GluR - B depletion appeared normal throughout life with no developmental abnormalities, or difference in body size and weight in adulthood ( wild - type: 31. 0 g +/- 1. 2; GluR - B Delta FB: 28. 4 +/- 0. 9; each n = 10).

Furthermore, enhancement in odor discrimination in both GluR - B Delta ECS: FB and GluR - B Delta FB mice makes it likely that improvement in this task results from the common AMPAR property change mediated by the depletion of GluR - B and the lack of the Q / R site - edited GluR - B subunit, both resulting in Ca2 + - permeable AMPARs.

Thus, to examine whether the pronounced variability of olfactory memory in GluR - B Delta FB mice ( Figure 2E) reflects variability of GluR - B levels in GluR - B Delta FB mice, we analyzed the residual amount of GluR - B protein in mice with disparate memory performances ( Figure 4A - C).	"GluR - B	75	83	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"GluR - B	135	143	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Notably, mice with pronounced memory deficits ( memory < 70%) showed essentially no detectable GluR - B protein in hippocampus, amygdala, olfactory bulb, and piriform cortex ( n = 2, Figure 4B, and unpublished data), but mice with almost complete memory displayed substantial residual GluR - B levels in all brain areas investigated ( n = 2, Figure 4B, and unpublished data).

GluR - A levels were unchanged from wild - type, indicating that compensatory up - regulation of other AMPAR subunits is unlikely ( GluR - A levels relative to control: 1. 02 +/- 0. 05, mean +/- SEM, n = 10).	"GluR - A	0	8	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"GluR - A	132	140	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - A"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""GluR - A"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In summary, mice with reduced GluR - B levels in forebrain areas showed decreased olfactory memory, which correlated tightly with a reduction in GluR - B levels in the hippocampus and cortical areas.	"GluR - B	30	38	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"GluR - B	145	153	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Enhanced odor learning and discrimination, on the other hand, was independent of residual GluR - B levels in the olfactory bulb and other forebrain areas, indicating that moderate GluR - B reductions are sufficient to saturate enhanced odor learning and discrimination.	"GluR - B	90	98	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"GluR - B	180	188	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 180, ""end_span"": 188, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The effect of selective GluR - B depletion in mice indicated that GluR - B - containing AMPARs in the hippocampus, and / or ( olfactory) cortex are likely to be important for olfactory memory.	"GluR - B	24	32	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"GluR - B	66	74	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The olfactory memory phenotype could be due to depletion of GluR - B in olfactory cortex or hippocampus; enhanced learning and discrimination capabilities might rather be evoked by AMPARs lacking GluR - B in the olfactory bulb.	"GluR - B	60	68	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"GluR - B	196	204	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 196, ""end_span"": 204, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Hence, transgenic GluR - B expression, specifically in the piriform cortex and hippocampus in the GluR - B knockout background, rescues the odor memory deficit but leaves enhanced olfactory discrimination and learning unaltered.	"GluR - B	18	26	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"GluR - B	98	106	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We employed gene - targeted and transgenic mice with region - specific expression to demonstrate that a change in GluR - B - mediated properties of AMPA channels in alpha CaMKII - expressing neurons of mouse forebrain, including olfactory bulb mitral and granule cells, enhances olfactory discrimination and learning but impairs olfactory memory.

This variability could be traced to epigenetic variability in the transgenic expression of Cre - recombinase, which mediated recombination within loxP - flanked segments of gene - targeted alleles for the dominant AMPAR subunit GluR - B, and hence operated the switch in AMPAR properties toward GluR - B ablation and increased Ca2 + permeability.	"GluR - B	228	236	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"GluR - B	295	303	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 228, ""end_span"": 236, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 295, ""end_span"": 303, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The subsequent transgene - driven re - introduction of GluR - B, specifically in piriform cortex and hippocampus, reversed the Cre - induced loss of GluR - B and partially rescued the odor memory deficit, but left unaltered the enhanced olfactory discrimination.	"GluR - B	55	63	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"GluR - B	149	157	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 149, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Olfactory Discrimination Is Increased in Mice with Forebrain - Specific GluR - B Ablation or GluR - B ( Q) Expression	"GluR - B	72	80	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"GluR - B	93	101	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Both forebrain - specific GluR - B ( Q) expression and GluR - B depletion led to increased olfactory learning and discrimination capabilities.	"GluR - B	26	34	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"GluR - B	55	63	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This was rather pronounced for GluR - B ( Q) - expressing mice, consistent with the overall stronger phenotypic consequences in comparison to GluR - B depletion, both when forebrain - selective ( [ 58], and this study) or global [ 53, 60].

A direct contribution to the phenotype by Ca2 + influx through genetically modified AMPA channels seems to be likely, since mice expressing Q / R site - unedited GluR - B showed even better odor learning and discrimination performance compared with mice with depleted GluR - B.	"GluR - B	162	170	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"GluR - B	268	276	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 162, ""end_span"": 170, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 268, ""end_span"": 276, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In mice expressing the unedited form of GluR - B ( Q), macroscopic conductance in whole - cell patches of CA1 pyramidals is increased [ 60], but excitatory transmission in CA3 - to - CA1 cell synapses is somewhat reduced, in spite of a lower threshold for generating a population spike [ 58], indicating increased synaptic excitability by sustained GluR - B ( Q) expression, in line with the seizure - prone phenotype.

This is further supported by kainate - induced Co2 + uptake in acute brain slices, revealing considerably higher Co2 + uptake via Ca2 + - permeable AMPARs in hippocampal pyramidal neurons of mice expressing GluR - B ( Q), than those lacking GluR - B ( DRS, RS, and PHS, unpublished data).

As Ca2 + influx through glutamate receptors is thought to contribute to lateral and recurrent inhibition ( [ 38] see also [ 39]), the absence of GluR - B, or the presence of GluR - B ( Q) in the olfactory bulb, is likely to result in increased inhibition between the principal neurons in this structure.

Metal - responsive transcription factor 1 ( MTF - 1) regulates expression of its target genes in response to various stress conditions, notably heavy metal load, via binding to metal response elements ( MREs) in the respective enhancer / promoter regions.

These data provide strong evidence for two major branches of cellular anti - cadmium defense, one via MTF - 1 and its target genes, notably metallothioneins, the other via glutathione, with an apparent overlap in selenoprotein W.

The level of functional MTF - 1 protein was examined by EMSA ( Figure 1c): MTF - 1 protein - DNA complex was detectable with liver protein extract from an Mtf1loxP control mouse, but no functional MRE - binding protein was observed with an Mtf1Mx - cre sample.

For the identification of MTF - 1 target genes, we compared the liver transcript profiles of mice with and without functional Mtf1 gene that had been mock - treated or exposed to cadmium ( n = 3 per genotype and respective treatment).

The basal level was reduced in livers from mock - and cadmium - treated Mtf1Mx - cre mice, indicating that MTF - 1 is important for the basal expression of Sepw1.

Ndrg1 probably has some role in stress response since various stimuli, including hypoxia and nickel compounds, activate expression of rodent Ndrg1 and / or its human ortholog ( 37 - 40).

The Ndrg1 microarray results were confirmed with semiquantitative RT - PCRs ( Figure 3a): for Mtf1loxP control livers, a clear increase of Ndrg1 expression was observed after cadmium exposure; in livers from Mtf1Mx - cre mice, this cadmium response was not detectable, while basal expression was similar to controls.

It cannot be judged by this experiment whether the degree of cadmium - induced reduction of Slc39a10 transcription was identical for Mtf1Mx - cre and Mtf1loxP mice or lower in the absence of MTF - 1.

Treatment with both BSO and cadmium resulted in an enhanced lethality particularly for the cells without functional Mtf1, indicating that a depletion of glutathione together with a lack of Mtf1 impair an efficient anti - cadmium defense.

In this study, a virtually complete deletion of Mtf1 in the liver of adult, pI - pC - induced Mtf1Mx - cre mice did not detectably affect the phenotype of the respective mice under non - stress conditions, confirming that MTF - 1 is dispensable in the adult liver ( 26), in contrast to its essential role in embryonic liver development ( 23).

This response was dependent on an overlapping - inverted MRE sequence located proximal to the rat Sepw1 transcription start ( 49), even though initial studies failed to demonstrate MTF - 1 binding to that sequence ( 50).

Our expression and DNA - binding studies strongly suggest that MTF - 1 is important for the basal expression of mouse Sepw1 by binding to the corresponding overlapping - inverted MRE sequence.

Such a role is strongly endorsed by our finding that Ndrg1 gene expression is also induced by cadmium, and that MTF - 1 plays a crucial role in this induction.

In the case of Csrp1, expression analyses and DNA - binding studies indicate that MTF - 1 is required for cadmium induction by binding to an MRE upstream of the transcription start.

Specific binding of MTF - 1 was observed for an MRE located just downstream of the Slc39a10 transcription start.

However, the inhibition of Slc39a10 expression by MTF - 1 may well be more complex than a competition for promoter binding.

Independent of MTF - 1, cadmium treatment also leads to downregulation of Slc39a10 transcripts, suggesting that some other factor is mediating this response.

The enhanced sensitivity to cadmium toxicity that we found for mouse embryonic fibroblasts upon a combination of Mtf1 deletion and depletion of glutathione further corroborates the importance of MTF - 1 and its target genes as well as reduced glutathione for an efficient anti - cadmium defense.

These results support the hypothesis that each of the antioxidant or DNA repair genes correlated with CEBPG in non - BC individuals is regulated by CEBPG.

Of particular note is the lack of correlation of the target genes with CEBPB, which binds to the same recognition site as CEBPG, and shares its recognition site within each of the antioxidant or DNA repair genes.

However, based on the preponderance of data thus far available, we conclude that CEBPG is responsible for optimal transcriptional regulation of key antioxidant or DNA repair genes in NBEC and that there is inter - individual variation in the regulation of each of these genes by CEBPG.

Consistent with our visual analysis of the histological sections, line 107 tTA / APP mice treated with dox for 3 or 6 mo had the same amount of aggregated A beta as when they started treatment at 6 mo of age ( Figure 4A and 4B).

Filter trap analysis of line 18 tTA / APP mice yielded similar results: the increase in aggregated A beta observed in untreated animals between 6 and 9 mo of age was completely arrested by transgene suppression ( Figure S5C and S5D).

We next used ELISA to measure total A beta in the brains of each group to determine whether any change in the amount or solubility of peptide occurred while APPswe / ind expression was suppressed.

Cortical homogenates were sequentially extracted to separate peptide into PBS -, SDS -, and FA - soluble fractions, then transgene - derived A beta 40 and A beta 42 were measured by human - specific ELISA [ 23].	"A beta 40	141	150	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"A beta 42	155	164	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""A beta 40"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""A beta 42"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 164, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Transgenic expression of APPswe / ind and consequent overproduction of A beta 42 cause early - onset amyloid deposition in untreated mice, in which deposits appear as early as 2 mo of age.	"ind	34	37	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"A beta 42	71	80	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""ind"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""A beta 42"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Two independent compounds tested in Tg2576 [ 33] and TgCRND8 [ 34] transgenic mice show no more than 85% suppression of A beta 40 levels, and where measured, even less suppression of A beta 42 ( approximately 60%) [ 35, 36].	"A beta 40	120	129	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"A beta 42	183	192	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""A beta 40"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""A beta 42"", ""start_span"": 183, ""end_span"": 192, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, even after accounting for the much higher APP expression levels in our mice than in the Tg2576 and TgCRND8 lines, we have achieved better absolute suppression of A beta production with the tet - off system than is currently possible with published gamma - secretase inhibitors.	"APP	48	51	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"A beta	168	174	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""APP"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""A beta"", ""start_span"": 168, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Since even the most advanced future pharmaceutical agents are unlikely to attain more complete control of A beta production than achieved here, this system provides a salient test of therapeutic intervention with A beta - lowering compounds.	"A beta	106	112	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"A beta	213	219	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""A beta"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""A beta"", ""start_span"": 213, ""end_span"": 219, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Overall, however, we interpret our findings as evidence that AD therapies that significantly lower the production of A beta ( by either inhibiting secretase activity or inhibiting APP expression) may not quickly reverse preexisting pathology, but should effectively halt further deposition of amyloid.	"A beta	117	123	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"APP	180	183	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""A beta"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""APP"", ""start_span"": 180, ""end_span"": 183, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In interpreting our study, it should be remembered that the earliest plaques to appear in these mice, like other APP transgenics harboring the Swedish mutation [ 27], are predominantly fibrillar deposits, which may be less tractable than the diffuse aggregates thought to come first in the course of the human disease.	"APP	113	116	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Swedish	143	150	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""APP"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Swedish"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, these low levels of peptide are not sufficient to induce new amyloid formation, as CaMKII alpha - tTA x tetAPPswe / ind mice raised on dox for up to a year do not develop amyloid lesions ( data not shown).

Consistent with this hypothesis, strong activation of microglia through transgenic expression of TGF beta [ 58] or central injection of lipopolysaccharide [ 59, 60] can by itself substantially reduce plaque burden in APP transgenic mice.	"TGF beta	97	105	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"APP	217	220	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""TGF beta"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""APP"", ""start_span"": 217, ""end_span"": 220, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
As in our tet - off APP mice, SantaCruz et al. found that tau neurofibrillary tangles, like amyloid plaques, are not cleared efficiently following transgene suppression.

Perhaps once aggregated, A beta and tau are either inherently more stable than other protein aggregates or more resistant to intra - and extracellular clearance mechanisms.

It is possible that a combination of therapies to limit A beta production, increase A beta degradation, and enhance phagocytosis of deposited amyloid may be required to reverse damage associated with AD.

We found that the full - length mr - s bait construct induced lacZ expression with the full - length mr - s prey construct ( Fig. 4B, full x full).

The N - terminus 400 aa stretch of mr - s was able to induce transcription of lacZ weakly with the same N - terminus 400 aa stretch of mr - s ( Fig. 4B, N x N).

Although the N - terminus 400 aa mr - s protein weakly activates lacZ transcription with the same N - terminus portion, a much stronger activation of lacZ expression was observed with a C - terminus portion encoding the 391 - 542 aa stretch of mr - s ( Fig. 4B, full x C, C x C).

Our GAL4 assay indicated that the signal when the full - length mr - s was present in both the bait and prey contexts was weaker than when isolated SAM domains were used.

As a negative control, we constructed Flag - tagged Sonic hedgehog ( Shh) ( lane 2 and 7).

To investigate whether the mr - s protein self - associates mainly through the SAM domain, two site - directed mutations were generated in the SAM domain of mr - s ( Fig. 1B, arrows).	"mr - s	27	33	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mr - s	157	163	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""mr - s"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mr - s"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 163, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Based on this result, we introduced two types of site - directed mutations, which correspond to the mutations introduced in ph protein, into Flag - tagged full - length mr - s ( Flag - W404A and Flag - G453A).	"ph	124	126	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mr - s	169	175	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""ph"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mr - s"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 175, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
These results, together with yeast two - hybrid GAL4 assay, indicate that the mr - s protein self - associates strongly through its SAM domain and weakly through the N - terminus portion lacking SAM domain.	"GAL4	48	52	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mr - s	78	84	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GAL4"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mr - s"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The putative nuclear localization signal at the N - terminus of the mr - s protein ( Fig. 1A, dashed box) suggests that the mr - s protein localizes in the nucleus.

To determine the subcellular localization of mr - s in mammalian cells, we introduced an HA - tagged full - length mr - s plasmid into HEK293T cells.	"mr - s	45	51	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mr - s	115	121	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""mr - s"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mr - s"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
To confirm the precise localization of the mr - s protein, full - length mr - s was co - immunostained with DAPI ( Fig. 6C - E).	"mr - s	43	49	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mr - s	73	79	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""mr - s"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mr - s"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The GAL4 - mr - s fusion protein functions as transcriptional repressor	"GAL4	4	8	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mr - s	11	17	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GAL4"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mr - s"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We generated effector plasmids, which express various deletion constructs of mr - s fused to the GAL4 DNA - binding domain ( Fig. 7A).	"mr - s	77	83	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"GAL4	97	101	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""mr - s"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""GAL4"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In addition, we confirmed that full - length mr - s without GAL4 DBD had no effect on the same reporter plasmid ( data not shown).	"mr - s	45	51	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"GAL4	60	64	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""mr - s"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""GAL4"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We next analyzed deletion constructs in which the N - terminus 400 aa stretch of mr - s ( amino acids 1 to 400) or the C - terminus portion ( amino acids 391 to 542) were fused to the GAL4 DBD ( Fig. 7A, DBD - N, DBD - C).	"mr - s	81	87	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"GAL4	184	188	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""mr - s"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""GAL4"", ""start_span"": 184, ""end_span"": 188, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
To determine the regions of mr - s involved in transcriptional repression more precisely, the C - terminus portion was divided into two regions and each was fused to the GAL4 DBD ( Fig. 7A, DBD - tail, DBD - SAM).	"mr - s	28	34	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"GAL4	170	174	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""mr - s"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""GAL4"", ""start_span"": 170, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Our results suggested that the C - terminal region of mr - s ( amino acids 463 to 542) is required for transcriptional repression of mr - s and the SAM domain appears to be dispensable for this repressive activity.	"mr - s	54	60	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mr - s	133	139	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""mr - s"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mr - s"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
mr - s fused to GAL4 DNA binding domain functions as a transcriptional repressor in HEK293T cells.	"mr - s	0	6	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"GAL4	16	20	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""mr - s"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 6, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""GAL4"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Taken together, our findings suggest that DBD - mrs functions as a transcriptional repressor and that the repression activity of mr - s is not due to a homophilic interaction through its SAM domain but to the C - terminal region ( amino acids 463 to 542).	"mrs	48	51	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mr - s	129	135	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""mrs"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mr - s"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This expression pattern correlates with the rapid increase of Crx, rhodopsin and other photoreceptor genes around P6 - P8.	"Crx	62	65	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"rhodopsin	67	76	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Crx"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""rhodopsin"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In situ hybridization and RT - PCR showed significant reduction of mr - s signal in the Crx KO retina and pineal gland.

In retinal photoreceptor cells, the Otx2 transcripts are not highly expressed at P6 - P9, while the Crx transcripts are strongly detected around P6.	"Otx2	36	40	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Crx	100	103	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Otx2"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Crx"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Therefore, our results strongly suggest that mr - s transcription is directly regulated by Crx.

In the present study, Nrl, a photoreceptor - specific transcription factor that is highly expressed in photoreceptors at the postnatal stage, did not affect the transcription of mr - s.

To characterize the biochemical function of mr - s, we performed yeast two - hybrid screening using full - length mr - s as the bait.	"mr - s	44	50	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mr - s	114	120	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""mr - s"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mr - s"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
An immunoprecipitation assay, using two site - directed mutants of the SAM domain of mr - s, demonstrated that the mr - s protein can self - associate through its SAM domain in mammalian cells.

In contrast to TEL, ph does not contain an obvious sequence - specific DNA binding motif ( 16).

Since mr - s does not contain obvious DNA binding motifs, we suppose that there is a sequence - specific transcription factor ( s) which interacts with mr - s.

Polymerization of the SAM domain has been previously reported to be essential for the repressive functions of ph and TEL [ 43, 44].

To clarify the biological function of mr - s, analysis of mice with targeted disruptions of mr - s will be very important.

mr - s is evolutionarily conserved from zebrafish through to human, suggesting a significant role of mr - s in photoreceptor development.

Moreover, mr - s protein fused to GAL4 DBD functions as a transcriptional repressor.

To test self - interaction of mr - s, we subcloned the full - length, N - terminus ( amino acids 1 - 400) and C - terminus ( amino acids 391 - 542) of mr - s into pGBKT7 and pGADT7 vectors.

For immunoprecipitation assay, 4 x hemagglutinin ( HA) or 3 x Flag tagged cDNA fragment encoding full - length mr - s ( full - HA and Flag - mrs), a cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 1 - 400 ( Delta SAM - HA and Flag - Delta SAM), and a cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 400 - 542 ( Flag - SAM) were subcloned into the pcDNA3 ( Invitrogen) expression vector.

We transfected the plasmid encoding HA - tagged full - length mr - s into HEK293T cells, seeded cells on coverslips coated with collagen 48 hr after transfection, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS) at room temperature for 20 min, and washed with PBS.

Similar to the Xpd + XPCS allele, the homozygous lethal Xpd + XP allele rescued cutaneous symptoms including hair loss ( except locally during the first round; unpublished data), reduced cysteine content ( cysteine index 9. 3 +/- 0. 9 standard deviation [ 87% of wt], p = 0. 01 versus TTD), ageing - associated premature cachexia ( males and females were 36. 1 +/- 6. 4 g [ 93% of wt] and 39. 2 +/- 3. 2 g [ 116% of wt], respectively), and reduced life span ( Table 2).

Relative to XpdTTD / KO hemizygote cells, UV survival was improved by the homozygous lethal Xpd + XPCS allele in XpdTTD / + XPCS compound heterozygous cells and to a lesser degree by the Xpd + XP allele ( Figure 4A).

Because of embryonic and cellular lethality, we were unable to test UV survival associated exclusively with the Xpd + XPCS or Xpd + XP alleles.

Rescue of hemizygous XpdTTD / KO survival by Xpd + XPCS and Xpd + XP alleles is illustrated by arrows marked A and B, respectively.

Next we asked whether the Xpd + XPCS and Xpd + XP alleles, despite decreased mRNA levels, ameliorated TTD symptoms by increasing overall TFIIH levels in compound heterozygous XpdTTD / + XPCS and XpdTTD / + XP cells.	"Xpd	26	29	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Xpd	41	44	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Xpd"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Xpd"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Consistent with low mRNA expression levels, neither the Xpd + XPCS nor the Xpd + XP allele was able to restore TFIIH abundance to wt levels in XpdTTD compound heterozygote cells ( Figure 4E and 4F).	"Xpd	56	59	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Xpd	75	78	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Xpd"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Xpd"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We observed differences in the ability of XpdTTD versus homozygous lethal Xpd + XPCS and Xpd + XP alleles to function in two transcription - related phenotypes separated in the organism by both time and space: embryonic lethality and terminal differentiation of enucleating skin and blood cells.	"Xpd	42	45	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Xpd	74	77	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Xpd"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Xpd"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The preblastocyst - stage homozygous lethality shared by the XpdKO, Xpd + XPCS, and Xpd + XP alleles most likely reflects a defect in basal transcription that is incompatible with life.	"Xpd	61	64	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Xpd	68	71	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Xpd"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Xpd"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Because embryonic lethality was also fully rescued in XpdTTD / KO hemizygous mice, the XpdTTD allele can be considered as wt and thus dominant to each of the homozygous lethal alleles ( XpdKO, Xpd + XPCS, and Xpd + XP) with respect to this particular phenotype ( Table 2).	"Xpd	54	57	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Xpd	87	90	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Xpd"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Xpd"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In compound heterozygous mice, both homozygous lethal Xpd + XPCS and Xpd + XP alleles were able to alleviate XpdTTD - specific cutaneous and anaemic features and can thus be defined as dominant over the XpdTTD allele with respect to these phenotypes.	"Xpd	54	57	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Xpd	69	72	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Xpd"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Xpd"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
During early embryonic development, XpdTTD is dominant over the Xpd + XPCS and Xpd + XP alleles, whereas later in the ontogenesis of skin, hair - shaft, and blood cells, the situation is reversed.	"Xpd	36	39	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Xpd	64	67	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Xpd"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Xpd"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Unfortunately, the structure - function relationship between disease - causing mutations and XPD functional domains, including detailed structural information on XPD or even its stoichiometry within TFIIH, remains unknown.	"XPD	93	96	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"XPD	162	165	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""XPD"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""XPD"", ""start_span"": 162, ""end_span"": 165, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, based on the ability of cell extracts that are defective in two different TFIIH components ( XPD and XPB) to complement NER activity in vitro [ 26], it is likely that TFIIH ( or its components) can either multimerise or exchange at least during the NER reaction.	"XPD	102	105	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"XPB	110	113	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""XPD"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""XPB"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We thus envisage the molecular mechanism of interallelic complementation to involve the exchange of XPD molecules within the TFIIH complex or turnover of TFIIH complexes containing different XPD molecules at the site of DNA damage during the course of the global genome as well as transcription - coupled repair of either UV - induced or endogenous DNA damage.

Recently, proteins originating from presumed null alleles were biochemically characterised as inactive in basal transcription [ 27], providing an explanation as to why these alleles failed to rescue lethality in haploid S. pombe with a null mutation in the XPD homologue rad15 [ 19].

In order to determine if specific pathways were altered in the B6 and A / J strains, mice with known alterations in hemostasis, Lepob mice, or thrombosis, Plg - / - and PAI - / - mice, were also tested.

To determine how alterations in the fibrinolytic system may affect rebleeding time, Plg - / - and PAI - 1 - / - mice were also tested ( Figure 2B).

Rebleeding time was not different in Plg - / - mice compared to WT littermates, but PAI - 1 - / - mice had a significantly ( P < 0. 05) reduced rebleeding time, which was 1. 8 - fold lower than for the B6 mice.

In addition, fibrinolytic activity, PAI - 1 activity, and alpha 2 - anitplasmin were also increased in the A / J mice when compared to the B6 mice ( Table 2).

Thus, the concentration of Plg in plasma from the A / J mice was higher than plasma from the B6 mice as determined by two methods and no difference in migration after electrophoresis was observed, suggesting no marked changes in the structure of Plg in the two mouse strains.

It has long been known that loss of the retinoblastoma protein ( Rb) perturbs neural differentiation, but the underlying mechanism has never been solved.

Remarkably, however, Rb promotes SAC differentiation by inhibiting E2f3 activity.

The retinoblastoma protein ( Rb), an important tumor suppressor, blocks division and death by inhibiting the E2f transcription factor family.

In contrast, Rb is thought to promote differentiation by potentiating tissue - specific transcription factors, although differentiation defects in Rb null cells could be an indirect consequence of E2f - driven division and death.

Removing E2f1 rescues aberrant division of differentiating Rb - deficient retinal neurons, as well as death in cells prone to apoptosis, and restores both normal differentiation and function of major cell types, such as photoreceptors.

Indeed, E2f3 - induced apoptosis in fibroblasts has recently been shown to require E2f1 [ 15].

Thus, it is controversial whether E2f3 is required for apoptosis of any Rb KO cell type.

Determining which activating E2fs promote death in distinct Rb KO tissues requires conditional rather than germ line models of Rb deletion to avoid secondary indirect effects ( such as hypoxia).

Indeed, silencing the Cdkn2d ( p19Arf) locus in unstressed cells relies on E2f3b [ 19].

Other E2fs may also exist in isoforms since at least two mRNA species have been detected for E2f1 and E2f2 [ 16].

In the retina, others have noted abnormally shaped Rb KO rods and have suggested Rb may directly promote their morphogenesis by activating retina - specific factors [ 29].

However, comprehensive assessment of the Rb / E2f1 double - null rescued retina revealed a differentiation defect in cholinergic starburst amacrine cells ( SACs).

E2f3 is also present in a specific subset of other CNS neurons, implying that this may be a general mechanism by which Rb facilitates neurogenesis.

To define the mechanism in even more detail, we determined which E2f3 isoform Rb targets to control SAC differentiation.

Thus, independent of E2f1 - mediated effects on division and death, Rb does regulate neuronal differentiation, but only in specific neurons and, unexpectedly, through E2f3a, not tissue - specific differentiation factors.

Strikingly, the ectopically positioned S - phase cells at E14, E16, and P0 and all the abnormal division at P8 and P18 were completely suppressed in the Rb / E2f1 DKO retina ( Figures 1C, 1E, 1F, S1A, and S2).

As with ectopic division and apoptosis ( Figure 1C and 1D), the rescue of Rb KO retinal bipolar, ganglion, and rod cells was dependent on E2f1 dose ( Figure 2A - 2D).

Separate from its role in driving ectopic division of Rb KO RTCs, E2f1 also promotes normal RPC division since in its absence RPC proliferation drops ~ 2 - fold ( D. C. and R. B., unpublished data).	"Rb	54	56	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"E2f1	66	70	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""E2f1"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Slightly reduced cell numbers were not due to residual RTC death since we have not observed ectopic apoptosis at any embryonic or postnatal stage in the developing Rb / E2f1 DKO retina ( Figures 1D, 1G, and S2).	"Rb	164	166	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"E2f1	169	173	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 166, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""E2f1"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, slightly reduced RPC division and dramatic rescue of severe defects in Rb KO RTCs are distinct effects stemming from the deletion of E2f1.	"Rb	77	79	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"E2f1	139	143	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""E2f1"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

Thus, we compared the electroretinograms ( ERGs) of adult WT ( alpha - Cre), E2f1 - / -, alpha - Cre; RbloxP / loxP, and alpha - Cre; RbloxP / loxP; E2f1 - / - mice.	"E2f1	77	81	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"E2f1	149	153	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""E2f1"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""E2f1"", ""start_span"": 149, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, E2f1 deletion almost completely rescued the rod system in the Rb KO retina.	"E2f1	6	10	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Rb	68	70	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""E2f1"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Cones represent only 3% of photoreceptors and, unlike rods, develop without Rb, but they require rods for survival, and in the Rb KO retina, they have abnormal morphology and their synaptic targets, bipolar cells, are much depleted [ 2].

Thus, E2f1 deletion not only rescues morphology but also both rod and cone system function in the Rb KO retina.

To test for subtle differences we stained the Rb / E2f1 DKO retina with 43 markers ( Table S1).

We first studied Calb2 ( calretinin), which marks a subset of amacrine and ganglion cell bodies as well as three tracks corresponding to their processes in the IPL ( Figure 3A).

We quantified Calb2 + cell bodies in the Rb KO INL ( corresponding to amacrine cell staining only) and observed a reduction from P8 onwards ( Figures 3C and S6).

Finally, we also examined the effect of Rb deletion on SAC differentiation using a Chx10 - Cre transgene that is expressed in a mosaic pattern across the retina, generating patches of Cre - expressing cells [ 42].

Slc18a3 became virtually undetectable in Rb KO SACs by P8 ( Figures 3C and S6C).

Rb Regulates SAC Differentiation through E2f3	"Rb	0	2	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"E2f3	41	45	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 2, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""E2f3"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Rb binds more than 100 proteins [ 43] and in some non - neuronal cells, such as skeletal muscle, adipocytes, and bone, Rb is thought to bind and potentiate tissue - specific transcription factors that promote differentiation [ 31 - 33].	"Rb	0	2	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Rb	119	121	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 2, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
At multiple time points, E2f1 deletion suppressed ectopic mitosis ( PH3 + cells), but did not reverse the SAC defect, and E2f2 deletion had no effect on either defect ( Figure 4A).	"E2f1	25	29	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"E2f2	122	126	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""E2f1"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""E2f2"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
To quantify the effect of different E2fs on ectopic division specifically in SACs, we exploited Isl1 ( Islet1).	"Isl1	96	100	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Islet1	103	109	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Isl1"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Islet1"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
It is also expressed earlier than Slc18a3, permitting analysis of SACs soon after their birth at ~ E15; thus, we could study retina at P0, a time when ectopic division is high in the inner retina and prior to Rb - independent cell cycle exit associated with terminal differentiation [ 2].	"Slc18a3	34	41	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Rb	209	211	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Slc18a3"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 209, ""end_span"": 211, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Indeed, about one - third of all Isl1 + cells in the entire inner NBL were dividing in the Rb KO retina, or ~ 50% in the periphery where Cre is expressed ( Figure 4E and data not shown).	"Isl1	33	37	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Rb	91	93	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Isl1"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The unique effect of E2f3 in disrupting the differentiation of SACs but not other retinal neurons might be due to cell - type - specific expression or cell - type - specific activity of E2f3.	"E2f3	21	25	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"E2f3	186	190	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""E2f3"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""E2f3"", ""start_span"": 186, ""end_span"": 190, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
As the retina differentiated and RPC division diminished, the number of E2f3 + cells also dropped, and by P8, when division is virtually over, only a subset of post - mitotic cells in the inner retina expressed E2f3 ( Figure 5A).	"E2f3	72	76	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"E2f3	211	215	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""E2f3"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""E2f3"", ""start_span"": 211, ""end_span"": 215, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This cytoplasmic E2f3 staining was also specific, as it was absent in the E2f3 KO peripheral retina of alpha - Cre; E2f3loxP / loxP mice ( Figure 5A).	"E2f3	17	21	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"E2f3	74	78	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""E2f3"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""E2f3"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Rb protein was also detected in the inner retina ( Figure 5A), and showed a similar distribution as E2f3 in SACs ( Figure 5B), and was also present in mature ganglion cells and M u ller cells as reported [ 51].

Note the absence of E2f3 protein in the peripheral E2f3 KO RPCs at P0 and in peripheral inner retinal neurons at P18.

Together, these results suggest that the common mechanism by which Rb promotes neural differentiation is through E2f3 inhibition.

As noted above, E2f3 and Rb staining in SACs was both nuclear and cytoplasmic ( Figure 5A and 5B).	"E2f3	16	20	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Rb	25	27	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""E2f3"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Analysis of Pou4f2, a nuclear transcription factor expressed in ganglion cells, showed that nuclear proteins had not contaminated the cytoplasmic fraction, and analysis of Slc18a3, a cytoplasmic SAC marker, confirmed that the reverse had also not occurred ( Figure 6).

Like E2f3a, Rb was present in both the WT cytoplasm and nucleus at P0, but at P18, when the levels of Rb had increased, it was primarily nuclear ( Figure 6).	"Rb	12	14	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Rb	102	104	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
A very faint cytoplasmic Rb signal was evident at P18, which is consistent with Rb staining of SAC processes ( Figure 5B), and with the very small proportion of SACs in the retina [ 38].

To test which E2f3 isoform is responsible for aberrant Rb KO SAC differentiation we exploited E2f3a - / - mice ( Figure 7A).	"E2f3	14	18	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Rb	55	57	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""E2f3"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Importantly, the levels of E2f3b message were similar in the Rb KO and Rb / E2f3a DKO retina, ruling out the possibility that any effects of E2f3a deletion we might observe were due to down - regulation of E2f3b ( Figure 7C).	"Rb	61	63	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Rb	71	73	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
E2f3a can trigger cell cycle induction, but because SAC defects are not linked to cell cycle perturbation ( Figures 3A and 4), and in view of the predominant association between E2f3b and Rb in quiescent cells [ 16, 19], we suspected that E2f3b may perturb differentiation in Rb KO SACs.

Here, deleting E2f1 specifically rescued ectopic division and death in the Rb KO retina.

Importantly, major Rb / E2f1 DKO neurons differentiated normally, and ERGs revealed the rescue of rod - and cone - mediated function, implicating a regular signal flow from photoreceptors to bipolar and amacrine cells.

We have also found that E2f1 deletion rescues cell - autonomous ectopic division, death, and differentiation defects in sporadic Rb KO clones generated using a Cre retrovirus vector ( M. P. and R. B., unpublished data).	"E2f1	24	28	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Rb	129	131	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""E2f1"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, deregulated E2f1 activity in the retina, whether resulting from the inactivation of Rb or from overexpression, promotes unscheduled cell division and triggers apoptosis in susceptible RTCs.

E2f1, rather than other E2fs, may be a potential target for novel therapeutics to prevent retinoblastoma in RB1 + / - humans.

Our ERG studies revealed rescue of the Rb KO rod - bipolar system, and almost complete restoration of the cone - bipolar system following E2f1 deletion.

Comprehensive marker analysis revealed that, in striking contrast to other retinal neurons, E2f1 deletion did not suppress defects in Rb KO cholinergic SACs.

The idea that Rb promotes muscle differentiation by potentiating Myod1 activity was contested [ 61], and other mechanisms proposed [ 62, 63], but not involving E2f repression.

Strikingly, however, we discovered that Rb promotes SAC differentiation through E2f3 ( Figure 8).	"Rb	40	42	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"E2f3	80	84	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""E2f3"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

Rb performs this function by inhibiting E2f1.	"Rb	0	2	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"E2f1	40	44	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 2, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""E2f1"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
E2f3 is expressed in a subset of CNS neurons ( this work) and drives specific cell - cycle - independent defects in Rb KO forebrain neurons [ 53].

Thus, E2f3 inhibition is the first, and may be the only, mechanism by which Rb participates directly in neuronal differentiation.

To further dissect the mechanism of action of Rb in SACs we determined the E2f3 isoform it targets to promote differentiation.

Nevertheless, our data prove that Rb definitely regulates SAC differentiation through the activating E2f3 isoform.

Indeed, immunostaining revealed that Rb and E2f3 colocalize to SAC processes.

The nuclear localization of E2f3b contrasts with that of other repressive E2fs in differentiating muscle, where E2f5 switches from the nucleus to cytoplasm, while E2f4 remains in both compartments [ 23].

In the case of SACs, the differentiation defects we observed ( e. g., loss of Slc18a3 and Chat) were not due to aberrant division, but it is possible there are other problems with these cells that are caused by ectopic division.

It is possible that Rb - mediated potentiation of tissue - specific transcription factors may, at least in some cases, be a redundant activity, and that the only critical Rb function is to inhibit E2f.
