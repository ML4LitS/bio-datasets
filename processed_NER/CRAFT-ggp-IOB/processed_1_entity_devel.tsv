Also, Mcoln1 maps to chromosome 8 and contains an open reading frame of 580 amino acids, with a transcript length of approximately 2 kb encoded by 14 exons, similar to its human counterpart.

The human gene MCOLN1 ( GenBank # AF287270) maps to chromosome 19p13. 2 - 13. 3 and encodes a novel protein that is a member of the transient receptor potential ( TRP) cation channel gene superfamily [ 7 - 10].

In order to clone the mouse homologue of MCOLN1, the human amino acid sequence was compared to the high throughput genomic sequence ( HTGS) database using TBLASTN, which identified the mouse BAC clone RPCI - 23 _ 387H4 ( GB No. AC079544. 1).

Since the human MCOLN1 gene encodes a single transcript [ 7 - 9], we carried out additional hybridizations with probes generated from various regions of the coding sequence and 3 ' UTR, and all probes identified the same two transcripts in the mouse ( data not shown).

In order to determine the coding sequence for the larger transcript, we searched the mouse EST database using each intron as well as the genomic sequence flanking the Mcoln1 gene.

Next, we directly compared the nucleotide and amino acid sequence of the alternatively spliced mouse transcript to the entire human MCOLN1 genomic sequence and found no significant similarity.

Only the expected bands were detected on the Southern and no bands were detected on the Northern, confirming that this alternative transcript is specific to murine Mcoln1.

It is obvious from our results, however, that the identification of this sequence as a full - length protein is incorrect since probes unique to the clone, as well as probes containing the Mcoln1 coding sequence, identify the same transcripts.

To determine the mechanisms that control regional differences in pigmentation, we have studied how a classical mouse mutation, droopy ear ( deH), affects dorsoventral skin characteristics, especially those under control of the Agouti gene.	"Agouti	227	233	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Agouti"", ""start_span"": 227, ""end_span"": 233, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Mice carrying the Agouti allele black - and - tan ( at) normally have a sharp boundary between dorsal black hair and yellow ventral hair; the deH mutation raises the pigmentation boundary, producing an apparent dorsal - to - ventral transformation.	"Agouti	18	24	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Agouti"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We identify a 216 kb deletion in deH that removes all but the first exon of the Tbx15 gene, whose embryonic expression in developing mesenchyme correlates with pigmentary and skeletal malformations observed in deH / deH animals.	"Tbx15	80	85	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Tbx15"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Transplantation experiments demonstrate that positional identity of the skin with regard to dorsoventral pigmentation differences is acquired by E12. 5, which is shortly after early embryonic expression of Tbx15.	"Tbx15	206	211	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Tbx15"", ""start_span"": 206, ""end_span"": 211, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Embryonic expression of Tbx15 in dorsolateral mesenchyme provides an instructional cue required to establish the future positional identity of dorsal dermis.	"Tbx15	24	29	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Tbx15"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In rodents and probably other mammals, this dorsoventral difference in hair color is brought about by differences in pigment type as determined by allelic variation of the Agouti gene ( Bultman et al. 1992; Miller et al. 1993).	"Agouti	172	178	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Agouti"", ""start_span"": 172, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Secreted by dermal papilla cells within each hair follicle ( Millar et al. 1995), Agouti protein causes melanocytes in that follicle to switch from the production of brown / black eumelanin to red / yellow pheomelanin.	"Agouti	82	88	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Agouti"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Agouti protein has a short radius of action ( Silvers and Russel 1955) and can be switched on and off during a single hair cycle ( Bultman et al. 1992, 1994; Miller et al. 1993; Vrieling et al. 1994); thus, its regulated expression is thought to be responsible for the cream - colored or yellow ventral surface of mice carrying the black - and - tan ( at) allele and for the yellow markings around the feet, ears, or head, i. e., tan points or head spots, of certain dog breeds.	"Agouti	0	6	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Agouti"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 6, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In laboratory mice, previous studies from our group and others identified two predominant Agouti mRNA isoforms that differ by virtue of their transcriptional initiation site and 5 ' untranslated exons.	"Agouti	90	96	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Agouti"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Animals carrying the at allele express only the ventral - specific Agouti transcript ( Bultman et al. 1994; Vrieling et al. 1994) and have black dorsal hairs and cream - colored to yellow ventral hairs, with a sharp boundary at the level of the limb - body wall articulations and in the middle of the whisker pad.	"Agouti	67	73	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Agouti"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Ventral - specific Agouti isoforms are also expressed in developing skin from embryonic day 10. 5 ( E10. 5) and beyond and may play a role in pigment cell differentiation ( Millar et al. 1995).	"Agouti	19	25	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Agouti"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, regulatory elements for ventral - specific Agouti isoforms are responsive to dorsoventral positional cues established in the embryo and whose effects persist after birth.	"Agouti	49	55	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Agouti"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
To better understand the mechanisms that give rise to differences between dorsal and ventral skin and to the boundary between them, we have determined how several morphologic characteristics vary along the dorsoventral axis of the mouse and how these characteristics correspond to ventral - specific Agouti expression and the lineage boundary that distinguishes somite from lateral plate derivatives.	"Agouti	300	306	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Agouti"", ""start_span"": 300, ""end_span"": 306, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We also make use of a classical mouse mutation, droopy ear ( Curry 1959), that produces a dorsal - to - ventral transformation of flank coat color by allowing expansion of the ventral - specific Agouti transcript.	"Agouti	195	201	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Agouti"", ""start_span"": 195, ""end_span"": 201, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Embryonic expression and transplantation studies suggest that Tbx15 is required to establish certain characteristics of dorsal patterning in mesenchymal cells of the developing flank.	"Tbx15	62	67	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Tbx15"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Furthermore, dorsoventral differences in pigmentation can represent differences in the number and / or differentiated state of pigment cells, as well as the type of pigment synthesized in response to expression of Agouti.	"Agouti	214	220	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Agouti"", ""start_span"": 214, ""end_span"": 220, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
To evaluate the relationship among these components, we compared their features among mice of different Agouti genotypes.	"Agouti	104	110	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Agouti"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, the region of transition for hair length is considerably broader than that for pigmentation and independent of Agouti genotype.	"Agouti	120	126	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Agouti"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Furthermore, measurements of relative hair length for animals of different age, size, and Agouti genotype also are very similar when normalized to body circumference ( Figure 1C).	"Agouti	90	96	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Agouti"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Using DOPA staining as an indicator of tyrosinase activity, we observed a gradual dorsoventral transition in isolated dermis preparations from P4. 5 ae / ae mice ( Figure 1G).

Thus, at least three characteristics distinguish dorsal from ventral skin: differences in pigment - type synthesis ( depending on Agouti genotype), differences in hair length, and differences in melanin content.

As described below, the gene defective in deH, Tbx15, is normally expressed in the dorsal region and therefore is likely to play a role in establishing the size and dorsal extent of the lateral region.

We used an F2 intercross with CAST / Ei mice to localize deH to a 0. 1 cM interval between D3Mit213 and 16. MMHAP32FLF1, which was refined by development of a bacterial artificial chromosome ( BAC) contig and additional markers to a 1. 4 Mb region that contained eight genes, including Tbx15 ( Figure 3A).

We considered Tbx15 as an excellent candidate for the skeletal abnormalities caused by deH, based on studies by Agulnik et al.	"Tbx15	14	19	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Tbx15"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
( 1998) and the partially completed mouse genome sequence, we found that portions of several Tbx15 exons could not be amplified from deH / deH genomic DNA.	"Tbx15	93	98	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Tbx15"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, the deletion removes 534 of the 602 amino acids encoded by Tbx15 ( including the T - box DNA - binding domain), deH / + animals are grossly normal, and the phenotype of deH / deH animals is identical to that described for the original allele.

These observations demonstrate that the pigmentary and craniofacial characteristics of deH are caused by loss of function for Tbx15.	"Tbx15	126	131	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Tbx15"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

By E13. 5, the developing dermis has become separated from the loose mesenchyme by a subcutaneous muscle layer; Tbx15 is expressed in all of these layers as well as the underlying abdominal muscles.

In P3. 5 skin, Tbx15 is expressed in both dorsal and ventral skin, most strongly in the condensed upper dermis and developing dermal sheaths of hair follicles; faint expression can also be detected in rare dermal papillae cells ( Figure 4B).

However, at E14. 5, the normal ventral - to - dorsal gradient of Agouti expression appeared to extend more dorsally in deH / deH embryos ( Figure 6A).	"Agouti	65	71	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Agouti"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

To examine directly the relationship between the pigmentation boundary and dermis derived from lateral plate mesoderm, we made use of a Cre transgene driven by the Hoxb6 promoter that was developed by Kuehn and colleagues ( Lowe et al. 2000).

En1 is transiently expressed in the developing flank; at E11. 5, transverse abdominal sections reveal domains in the neural tube, somite - derived mesenchyme, and the ventral body wall ( Figure 8C).

An adjacent section hybridized with Tbx15 reveals a complementary pattern in the flank, which provides additional evidence for developmental mechanisms that establish a pigmentation boundary entirely within lateral plate mesoderm and independent of lineage restrictions imposed by the lateral somitic frontier.

Several mutations and genes have been identified that affect the pattern of hair follicle development, but Tbx15 is the only gene of which we are aware that affects the pattern of hair pigmentation in different body regions.

Ventral areas that normally produce yellow hair in the trunk, limbs, and craniofacial regions are expanded in deH / deH mice and, in the trunk at least, represent inappropriate dorsal expression of an Agouti mRNA isoform that is normally restricted to ventral skin.

Our results suggest that patterned expression of Tbx15 provides an instructional cue required to establish the future identity of dorsal dermis with regard to pigmentary and hair length patterning.

The ventral edge of Tbx15 expression in the developing flank does not correspond to a known lineage compartment, but, like limb development, occurs within lateral plate mesoderm.

However, Agouti mRNA in both embryonic and postnatal skin is distributed along a gradient whose dorsal boundary is indistinct and overlaps with two additional gradients recognized by their effects on hair length and histochemical staining for melanocytes.

Named for the presence of a DNA - binding domain first identified in the mouse Brachyury gene ( haploinsufficiency causes a short tail), T box - containing genes have been identified as developmental regulators in a wide spectrum of tissues and multicellular organisms ( reviewed in Papaioannou 2001).

( 1998) suggested human Tbx15 that lies on Chromosome 1p11. 1 as a candidate for acromegaloid facial appearance ( AFA) syndrome, for which there is a weak positive LOD score to Chromosome 1p ( Hughes et al. 1985).

The deH phenotype exhibits little overlap with these features; instead, we suggest a more likely candidate for mutations of human TBX15 would be frontofacionasal syndrome, an unmapped autosomal recessive condition characterized by brachycephaly, blepharophimosis, and midface hypoplasia ( Reardon et al. 1994).

However, Agouti is also expressed in the embryo, where it provides a convenient marker of ventral dermis identity.	"Agouti	9	15	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Agouti"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
For example, while the expanded domain of Agouti expression in postnatal deH / deH animals can be traced to events that occur between E11. 5 and E13. 5, the underlying cause may be that embryonic cells in dorsolateral mesenchyme acquire a ventral rather than dorsal identity or that those cells fail to proliferate normally, followed by compensatory expansion of ventral cells.	"Agouti	42	48	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Agouti"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Loss of Tbx15 also affects regional distribution of hair color in the limbs, with areas that would normally produce black hair giving rise to yellow hair instead.	"Tbx15	8	13	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Tbx15"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In fact, the same mechanism that determines dorsoventral position of the limbs and the apical ectodermal ridge may also act on expression of Tbx15 in the trunk, since ectopic limbs induced in the interlimb region by application of FGF beads develop along a single line that is coincident with normal limb buds ( and the future pigmentation boundary) ( Cohn et al. 1995; Crossley et al. 1996; Vogel et al. 1996; Altabef et al. 1997, 2000).	"Tbx15	141	146	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Tbx15"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Our model predicts that ectopic expression of Tbx15 in ventral mesenchyme should give rise to a dorsalized pigmentation phenotype and could be tested with gain - of - function approaches.

However, Tbx15 expression is very dynamic and is restricted to dorsal mesoderm only from E11. 5 to E13. 5.	"Tbx15	9	14	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Tbx15"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

An additional dorsoventral domain that is not externally apparent has emerged from studies of Msx1, whose expression marks a subgroup of somite - derived mesenchymal cells that contribute to dermis in a narrow stripe along the paraspinal region ( Houzelstein et al. 2000).	"Msx1	94	98	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Msx1"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, there exist at least three distinct boundaries in postnatal mammalian skin that are parallel to the sagittal plane, marked by differences in pigment - type synthesis, differences in cell lineage, and differences in expression of Msx1.

Raccoons, squirrels, skunks, and many different ungulates exhibit lateral stripes whose developmental origins have not been investigated, but may correspond to the lateral somitic frontier, the paraspinal Msx1 compartment, or an interaction between these domains.

Neither German shepherds nor deer mice have craniofacial characteristics similar to the deH mutation, but the pigmentation patterns in these animals could represent alterations in the regulation or action of Tbx15 activity.

In addition, the dopamine D2 receptor deficient mice repeatedly fail to alter their response patterns during reversal trials where the reinforcement rules were inverted.

Inbred C57Bl / 6J mice that develop in the complete absence of functional dopamine D2 receptors are capable of olfaction but display an impaired ability to acquire odor - driven reinforcement contingencies.

Furthermore, the ability of dopamine D2 receptor deficient mice to adjust their responding to a previously reinforced stimulus when unexpected outcomes are encountered is significantly impaired.

These findings suggest that signaling mediated by the dopamine D2 receptor is important for regulating associative and reversal learning and may have implications for the treatment of human attention disorders.

While D2R antagonists have been used in the context of rodent associative learning paradigms, their lack of receptor subtype specificity [ 13] and motor - disrupting effects [ 6, 8] have prevented a rigorous examination of the actual role this dopamine receptor subtype plays in associative and reversal learning in the context of an operant behavior.

Moreover, acute dosing does not recapitulate the marked learning deficits produced in rodents [ 15, 16] by chronic exposure to dopamine D2R antagonists [ 6, 7].

The influence of dopamine D2R - mediated signaling on reversal learning is also poorly understood.	"dopamine D2R	17	29	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""dopamine D2R"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Moreover an inverse relationship between lower dopamine D2R levels and compulsive behavior in human subjects has been reported [ 22].	"dopamine D2R	47	59	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""dopamine D2R"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Taken together these findings suggest that D2R - mediated signaling could play a critical role in reversal learning but are insufficient to prove it.	"D2R	43	46	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""D2R"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Here we report that dopamine D2R - mediated signaling must be intact if a mouse is to efficiently learn to associate a food reinforcer with a specific odor and then adaptively disengage inappropriate behavioral strategies following the reversal of reinforcement contingencies.

Therefore, the number of D2R + / + mice represented in session # 1 is 8, in session # 2 n = 8, session # 3 n = 6 ( 2 mice met our criterion), in session # 4 n = 5 ( three met the criterion).

In this study, we sought to determine the contribution of dopamine D2 receptor - mediated signaling to the various stages of associative and reversal learning.	"dopamine D2 receptor	58	78	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""dopamine D2 receptor"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
D2R - / - mice demonstrated that they were capable of learning to locate and consume food pellets, indicating that their locomotor behavior was not detectably disrupted and their primary motivation to obtain a natural reinforcer ( food pellet) was undisturbed.	"D2R	0	3	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""D2R"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Mice with or without intact dopamine D2R - mediated signaling displayed similar decreases in latencies to retrieve unhidden food pellets ( Fig. 1) and learned to dig for food buried in unscented sand ( Fig. 2).	"dopamine D2R	28	40	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""dopamine D2R"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
These findings are in complete agreement with earlier studies that utilized rats and fairly selective D2R antagonists [ 3 - 8], as well as even very extensive 6 - OHDA lesions [ 1, 10, 11] in associative and operant learning paradigms.	"D2R	102	105	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""D2R"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Our results add to a growing literature demonstrating a negligible role of dopamine, and now, specifically, D2Rs in the unconditioned or hedonic value of natural ( food) reinforcers [ 1, 2].

Several studies have demonstrated that both the acquisition [ 6, 7] and expression [ 9] of associative learning are mediated by dopamine D1Rs.	"dopamine D1Rs	128	141	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""dopamine D1Rs"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Moreover, it has been reported that acute administration of the dopamine D2 / 3 antagonist, raclopride, actually improves acquisition of food - motivated associative learning [ 6].	"dopamine D2	64	75	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""dopamine D2"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Additionally, none of these studies addressed the observation that the effects of D2R antagonists on locomotion and learning depend on whether exposure is chronic or acute [ e. g. [ 15, 16]].	"D2R	82	85	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""D2R"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Quite possibly, the functional role of D2Rs in associative learning might be masked because of this concern about locomotor disruption [ 2, 6, 8].	"D2Rs	39	43	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""D2Rs"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
These doses have been shown to occupy well over 80% of available D2Rs [ 29].	"D2Rs	65	69	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""D2Rs"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Future experiments measuring acquisition of associative learning in rodents that received chronic administration of D2R antagonists and demonstrated behavioral tolerance to their motor disrupting effects would be a logical test of this hypothesis.	"D2R	116	119	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""D2R"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Rather, we argue that this is not likely because the D2R - / - mice did learn to retrieve the food pellets from the dishes and eventually learned to accurately discriminate odors.	"D2R	53	56	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""D2R"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Recent electrophysiological data demonstrate that dopamine D2R ' s are located on glutamatergic terminal axons of olfactory nerves and depress excitatory input of the olfactory nerve to the mitral cells of the olfactory bulb [ 30, 31].

Consequently, our data, and data from other studies, suggest that the complete lack of D2Rs in the olfactory bulb does not prevent transduction of olfactory stimuli; rather it affects the ability to habituate, or tune, olfactory nerve activity associated with repeatedly encountered concentrations of chemical stimuli [ 32].	"D2Rs	87	91	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""D2Rs"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
[ 34] demonstrated that tetanic stimulation of dorsal striatum slices prepared from D2R - / - mice is associated with enhanced EPSP and as a result increased striatal synaptic efficacy.	"D2R	84	87	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""D2R"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
"Carlsson and colleagues [ 35] have speculated that dopamine D2R stimulation in the striatum serves to "" brake "" or diminish excitatory corticostriatal signaling and plasticity."

Indeed, perseverative behavior is associated with over activity of the dorsal striatum in rodents [ 36] and over activity of the caudate in patients with ADHD [ 37] and a strong inverse correlation of D2R binding with compulsive behavior has been reported [ 22].	"D2R	201	204	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""D2R"", ""start_span"": 201, ""end_span"": 204, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Importantly, our data indicate that the poor performances displayed by the D2R - / - mice are manifestations of reversal learning deficits and not gross motivational or sensory impairments.

We therefore argue that D2Rs participate in signaling or alerting the organism of learning contingency changes during reversal learning and sculpt ongoing goal - directed behavior.

This study demonstrates that signaling by dopamine D2Rs does not mediate the hedonic value of reinforcers, supporting and refining earlier findings [ 1, 2].

However, mice completely deficient in D2Rs demonstrated disrupted acquisition of discriminative stimulus relationships and an impaired ability to recognize changes in behavioral determinants.

Therefore, we suggest that during associative learning or when unexpected reinforcement outcomes are modified ( reversal learning) dopamine - driven reinforcement impulses involve signaling mediated by dopamine D2Rs.

We next investigated the contribution of dopamine D2Rs to reversal learning behavior by inverting the reinforcement contingencies - now the former S + signaled no reinforcer and the previous S - now indicated reinforcement availability.

However, during evolution, the TACC proteins have now acquired the ability to directly interact with components of these complexes ( such as the LSm proteins, nuclear hormone receptors, GAS41, and transcription factors).

Two additional TACC family members were subsequently identified and mapped to paralogous chromosomal regions on human chromosomes 4p16 and 10q26, physically close to members of the FGFR gene family [ 1 - 3].

This mapping data, together with identification of a single TACC gene in the protostomes Caenorhabitis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster [ 4 - 6], led to the speculation that the ancestral FGFR and TACC genes were located physically close to each other.

Sequence similarity searches of the publicly available genome databases with the BLAST and TBLAST programs were performed to identify TACC and RHAMM orthologues, and other members of the coiled coil superfamily in a diverse set of species ( Fig. 1).

Therefore, based upon the sequence identity between these genes, we designed a consensus oligonucleotide primer, T3con2, that would be suitable for the identification of the region containing the initiator methionine of the TACC3 cDNAs from primates and rodents.

Evidence used in support of this claim included its chromosomal location on 5q32 in humans ( discussed below), its sequence similarity in its coiled coil domain to the TACC domain and the subcellular localization of the RHAMM protein in the centrosome.

Significantly, sequence and phylogenetic analysis of coiled coil proteins ( Fig. 1) clearly shows that RHAMM does not contain a TACC domain and instead forms a distinct family of proteins in the coiled coil superfamily, and is not a direct descendant of the ancestral TACC gene.

Recently, detailed analyses of the chromosomal regions containing the FGFR gene family in humans, mouse and the arthopod D. melanogaster have revealed the conservation of paralogous chromosomal segments between these organisms ( Fig. 2, [ 13], Table 1 [ see Additional file 1]).	"FGFR	70	74	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""FGFR"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This suggests that the ancestral FGFR - TACC gene pair most probably arose prior to the initial duplication and subsequent divergence of these paralogous chromosomal segments, estimated to have occurred 687 +/- 155. 7 MYA.	"FGFR	33	37	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""FGFR"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This has raised the suggestion that a fourth TACC gene in vertebrates would reside in the same chromosomal region as FGFR4.	"FGFR4	117	122	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""FGFR4"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Indeed this hypothesis has been used in support for the RHAMM gene as a member of the TACC family [ 10].	"RHAMM	56	61	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""RHAMM"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

However, it should be noted that no clusters of genes from the vertebrate paralogous segments are locate close to the TACC or RHAMM genes of C. intestinalis, indicating that the formation of the much larger paralogous segments encompassing the FGFR - TACC genes formed later in evolutionary time, or conversely have been subject to extensive rearrangement in tunicates.

In combination with the examination of the T. rubripes genome, this also provides additional evidence that either the second round of duplication of the chromosomal segment that contained the FGFR3 / 4 ancestor did not include a TACC gene, or that such a gene was lost very early in vertebrate evolution, prior to the divergence of the Gnanthostome lineages.

However, the final resolution of the initial evolution of these paralogous segment will await the sequencing of the amphioxus and lamprey genomes, which only have one FGFR gene, and therefore should only contain one copy of the other corresponding genes in this conserved segment.

It is interesting that each TACC gene contains one large exon, which shows considerable variability between TACC orthologues, and constitutes the main difference between the TACC3 genes in the vertebrates ( see below).

The lack of conservation in both size and sequence of the central portion of the TACC3 proteins of human and mouse has been previously noted, and accounts for the major difference between these two orthologues [ 2].

In rodents, however, this region is almost entirely composed of seven 24 amino acid repeats, which are located in a single exon of the mouse and rat TACC3 genes.

Using an in silico protein - protein interaction model based upon known mitotic spindle and centrosomal components, we have previously predicted a number of additional interactions that could be conserved between a functional TACC homologue in yeast, spc - 72, and one or more human TACC proteins [ 21].

However, over the process of evolutionary time, with the acquisition of new domains and duplication of the chordate TACC precursor, the chordate TACC proteins have acquired the ability to directly interact with some of the other components of these complexes ( such as the LSm proteins, nuclear hormone receptors, GAS41, accessory proteins and transcription factors), and thus evolved additional functions within these complexes.

While Fog2 expression is diffuse in the pulmonary mesenchyme after lobar structure is well established ( E12. 5), it is more focally expressed in the mesenchyme surrounding the right middle lobe and accessory buds as these lobes form.

Employing microarray and in situ hybridization analysis we have found that the rd7 retina contains a modestly increased number of S - opsin - expressing cells that ultrastructurally appear to be normal cones.

One exception to this statement is the gene RIKEN cDNA 4933409K07 ( Figure 1, gene G47), which was the only gene shown to be up - regulated at all timepoints examined.

Previous studies have estimated that the total number of cones in the mouse retina is 2% of all retinal cells [ 20], and that S - opsin is largely repressed in cones in the dorsal third of the retina [ 21].	"S - opsin	126	135	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""S - opsin"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

The fact that only 3. 2% of all retinal cells are S - opsin - positive in the rd7 mutant also confirms that the majority of the photoreceptors ( which make up just over 70% of the cells in the adult mouse retina) do not express this gene.

One further finding to note is that the cell bodies of the M - opsin - positive cells appear to be scattered throughout the ONL in the rd7 mutant at P14 ( Figure S8).	"M - opsin	59	68	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""M - opsin"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In addition, by P28, the M - opsin - positive cell bodies in rd7 appear to have relocated to their normal position at the scleral edge of the ONL ( Figure S8).

It is possible that in the rd7 mutant retina, there is a short delay in the relocation of the M - opsin - expressing cone cell bodies to the scleral edge of the ONL.

Despite this modest delay in the onset of rhodopsin expression, by P14 the gene had attained nearly normal levels in the rd7 mutant ( see Figure 2, lower left photomicrographs).

Strikingly, Nr2e3 itself was markedly up - regulated in the rd7 mutant both by microarray and in situ hybridization ( see Figure 2, lower right photomicrographs; Table S2).

A comparison between the distribution of these cells and those expressing S - cone opsin strongly suggests that they represent the same cell population ( compare Figure 7D and 7F).

"These findings, along with the absence of rhodopsin staining in these cells ( see Figure 3D - 3F), suggest that these "" cone - like "" cells in the rd7 mutant retina may represent supernumerary normal cones with an abnormal localization of their cell bodies."

In addition, comparison of the diagrammatic representation of the wild - type and rd7 ONLs suggests that the average area of the S - opsin - negative cells in rd7 is greater than in the wild - type ( Figure 7C and 7D).	"S - opsin	129	138	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""S - opsin"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In this paper we have determined that the primary role of the rod - specific transcription factor, Nr2e3, is to maintain cone genes transcriptionally silent within rods.

Although genes showing type I derepression demonstrated staining in the majority of cells in the ONL, two lines of evidence suggest that these genes are not completely derepressed in these cells when compared to their expression in S - opsin - expressing cones.	"S - opsin	232	241	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""S - opsin"", ""start_span"": 232, ""end_span"": 241, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
First, close evaluation of the staining pattern of a number of type I genes in the rd7 mutant retina ( e. g., see Table S1, genes G9, G19, and G24), reveals that, in addition to the background staining throughout the ONL, there is a more darkly staining subpopulation of cells scattered throughout this layer in a distribution corresponding to that of the supernumerary S - cone opsin - expressing cells.	"S - cone opsin	370	384	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""S - cone opsin"", ""start_span"": 370, ""end_span"": 384, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This pattern of staining suggests that these genes are more highly expressed in S - opsin expressing cells than in the hybrid cells of the rd7 retina.	"S - opsin	80	89	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""S - opsin"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The second line of evidence derives from a comparison of the expression pattern of many type I genes in rd7 and Nrl - / - mutant backgrounds.	"Nrl	112	115	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Nrl"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
It can be inferred from this fact that Nrl is absolutely required for the normal silencing of cone - specific genes in rods.	"Nrl	39	42	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Nrl"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In the Nrl homozygous mutant, there is a stronger and more uniform derepression of many cone - specific genes throughout the ONL than is seen in the rd7 retina ( unpublished data).	"Nrl	7	10	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Nrl"", ""start_span"": 7, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The second pattern of derepression seen in the rd7 retina ( type II), is represented by a scattered population of cells throughout the ONL that shows derepression of several cone - specific genes, including S - cone opsin.	"S - cone opsin	207	221	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""S - cone opsin"", ""start_span"": 207, ""end_span"": 221, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Quantitation of these supernumerary S - cone opsin - positive cells indicates that they are approximately 2 - fold more abundant than in normal retina, consistent with previous antibody studies [ 17].	"S - cone opsin	36	50	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""S - cone opsin"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Both studies showed that cone genes in addition to S - cone opsin are derepressed in the mouse rd7 mutant.	"S - cone opsin	51	65	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""S - cone opsin"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
[ 19] found by RT - PCR that the levels of several rod - specific genes, including rhodopsin, were modestly reduced in rd7 at P28.	"rhodopsin	83	92	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""rhodopsin"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Our in situ hybridization data suggest that rhodopsin expression is markedly reduced at P6, but that it attains levels indistinguishable from wild - type by P14.

Since the change in rhodopsin levels identified by Peng et al. were relatively small ( an approximately 15% reduction), it is not surprising that such a difference was not detected by in situ hybridization.

Nevertheless, previous studies have suggested that Fabp7 is expressed in radial glia and immature astrocytes in the brain [ 28 - 30].	"Fabp7	51	56	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Fabp7"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

The factor ( s) controlling these differences are unknown, but may be intrinsic, as cocultures of older and younger retinas, conditioned media from older retinas, and addition of a variety of small molecules were unable to promote the expression of M - opsin in the P0 - initiated cultures [ 32].	"M - opsin	249	258	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""M - opsin"", ""start_span"": 249, ""end_span"": 258, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

It is possible that a subtle increase in M - opsin transcript levels does occur in the rd7 retina, and that this difference could not be detected by in situ hybridization.

One of the most curious findings in the rd7 mutant retina was the occurrence of two different types of changes: an increase in the number of S - opsin - expressing cones and a transformation of rods into hybrid photoreceptors.	"S - opsin	141	150	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""S - opsin"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
It is known that Nr2e3 is expressed only in rods, and the transcript is first detectable in postmitotic cells ( J. Trimarchi and CLC, unpublished data).	"Nr2e3	17	22	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Nr2e3"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
First, it is possible that there are two distinct types of rod precursor; loss of Nr2e3 in one leads to S - cone fate and in the other results in a hybrid cell type.	"Nr2e3	82	87	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Nr2e3"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
One test of the hypothesis that there are two temporally distinct rod precursor populations would be to carry out birthdating experiments to determine whether the supernumerary S - opsin - positive cells in the rd7 retina derived exclusively from an early - or late - born population.	"S - opsin	177	186	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""S - opsin"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 186, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In this scenario, the absence of Nr2e3 would alter the probability that an unknown master control gene is expressed in rod precursors.	"Nr2e3	33	38	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Nr2e3"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This conclusion is consistent with the evidence from human ESCS patients indicating a markedly reduced rod system and a lack of measurable rhodopsin by reflection densitometry [ 1, 2, 10, 11].

It is also unlikely that we would fail to detect an ESCS - like ERG signal in mice if it were present, as such a signal has been demonstrated in the Nrl mutant mouse, which has a near total transformation of all its rods into blue cones [ 24].

These findings, however, do not rule out the possibility that the abnormal human ERG derives from a hybrid photoreceptor cell type that also expresses S - opsin.

The final common feature between mouse rd7 and human NR2E3 mutants is the presence of an abnormally laminated retina with waviness and rosette formation in the ONL [ 12 - 15].

In the present study we found the mouse crumbs ortholog to be up - regulated in the rd7 mutant retina by microarray, consistent with its higher expression level in cones than in rods [ 50].

Although we were unable to confirm this finding by in situ hybridization due to the weakness of the signal, it is possible that the up - regulation of crumbs in the retina is the cause of the lamination defects seen in the rd7 mutant.

In the placenta, female mice normally inactivate the X chromosome that they inherit from their fathers ( Xp), so if females inherit from their mother an X chromosome ( Xm) that bears the abnormal copy of Atrx ( XmMUTXp), one would predict that, like affected males, they would fail to form a normal placenta.

It is usually associated with a mild form of alpha - thalassaemia, caused by reduced expression of structurally intact alpha - globin genes, and characterised by the presence of beta - globin tetramers ( haemoglobin H inclusion bodies) in peripheral red blood cells.

The ATR - X syndrome is caused by mutations in a gene ( ATRX) that comprises 36 exons spanning 300 kb of genomic DNA at Chromosome Xq13. 3 [ 3].	"ATRX	56	60	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""ATRX"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
As well as the full - length ATRX protein of ~ 280 kDa, which is encoded by a transcript of ~ 10 kb, we recently demonstrated that a truncated isoform called ATRXt ( ~ 200 kDa) is produced from a transcript of around 7 kb, which arises when intron 11 fails to be spliced from the primary transcript and an alternative intronic poly ( A) signal is used [ 4].

Furthermore, disruption of ATRX leads to diverse changes in DNA methylation [ 11].	"ATRX	27	31	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""ATRX"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Nevertheless, the role ATRX plays in gene expression remains unclear.	"ATRX	23	27	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""ATRX"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The consistent core of clinical and haematological features observed in ATR - X patients suggests that, like the SWI2 / SNF2 chromatin - remodelling protein, ATRX probably regulates transcription of a discrete set of target genes.

However, although there are clearly others to be found, at present the alpha - globin genes remain the only confirmed targets for transcriptional regulation by ATRX.

The failure to recover targeted clones with these vectors suggested that Atrx may be important for normal ES cell growth and expansion and that direct targeting of the single locus may not be possible.

Northern and Western blot analyses ( Figure 2D and 2E) confirmed that the Atrxflox clones continued to express both full - length Atrx protein and the truncated Atrxt isoform.

Northern and Western blot analyses ( Figure 2D and 2E) revealed that the full - length Atrx transcript and protein is completely abolished in the Atrx Delta 18 Delta neo recombinant clones, suggesting that deletion of this region has a highly destabilising effect on the full - length transcript.

Thus, a conditional knockout strategy allowed the isolation of ES cells that are null for full - length Atrx.	"Atrx	104	108	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Atrx"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Atrxnull ES cells could be maintained in culture but were generally slower growing than Atrx + ES clones, and appeared to undergo higher rates of spontaneous differentiation.

Equal numbers of Atrx + ( bearing either an AtrxWT or an Atrxflox allele) and Atrxnull ( bearing an Atrx Delta 18 Delta neo allele) ES cells were inoculated into cultures and the mixed cultures were passaged ( 1: 3 split) every 2 d for 8 - 10 d.

In a control competition experiment between different clones bearing functional Atrx alleles ( AtrxWT and Atrxflox), both clones continued to be equally represented after 8 d of cocultivation.	"Atrx	80	84	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Atrx"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, although Atrxnull ES cells could be recovered and maintained in culture by a conditional targeting approach, these cocultivation experiments suggested that the absence of Atrx does negatively impact upon normal ES cell growth.

To investigate a possible cell - cycle defect in the absence of Atrx, we analysed the cell cycle distribution of bromodeoxyuridine ( BrdU) - pulsed ES cells by flow cytometry ( Figure S1A).	"Atrx	64	68	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Atrx"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Surprisingly, both Atrxnull ES cell clones exhibited a cell cycle profile that was indistinguishable from ES cells bearing a functional Atrx allele ( AtrxWT or Atrxflox).	"Atrx	19	23	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Atrx"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, the growth defect observed in ES cells lacking Atrx is not due to a specific cell cycle block or significant induction of cell death.	"Atrx	53	57	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Atrx"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
It has been shown that disease - causing mutations in the human ATRX gene give rise to changes in the normal pattern of DNA methylation at several repetitive sequences within the human genome [ 11].

Notably, the transcribed region of the ribosomal DNA ( rDNA) repeat was found to be significantly hypomethylated in ATR - X patients relative to normal individuals.

Using methylation - sensitive restriction enzymes, we also observed significant hypomethylation at several sites tested within the mouse rDNA repeats in Atrxnull ES cells and 12 - d embryoid bodies relative to ES cells and embryoid bodies bearing a functional Atrx allele ( AtrxWT or Atrxflox) ( Figure 3B and 3C).	"Atrx	153	157	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Atrx"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The observation that rDNA is hypomethylated in the absence of Atrx, even in ES cells, is consistent with the finding that hypomethylation of the human rDNA repeats is detectable from an early developmental stage in ATR - X patients.	"Atrx	62	66	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Atrx"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
These repeats were found to be moderately ( Line 1 and Sine B1) or highly ( IAP, major satellite, minor satellite) methylated in wild - type ES cells, and this methylation was not detectably perturbed by the absence of Atrx ( Figure S3 and unpublished data).

Taken together, these data indicate that the subtle interplay between the ATRX protein and DNA methylation observed in human patients is also present in mouse cells.	"ATRX	74	78	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""ATRX"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
To investigate the role of the Atrx protein during mouse development, we initially established lines of mice bearing the Atrxflox allele.	"Atrx	31	35	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Atrx"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Widespread expression of the GATA1 - cre transgene has been demonstrated during early embryogenesis [ 14].	"GATA1	29	34	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GATA1"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

Thus the absence of Atrx gives rise to embryonic lethality in mice before 9. 5 dpc.	"Atrx	20	24	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Atrx"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
To investigate the morphology of Atrxnull embryos prior to death, embryos from the above crosses were initially dissected in their deciduas at 7. 5 dpc, and paraffin sections were stained with haematoxylin ( Figure 5A) or with an anti - ATRX antibody ( Figure 5B - 5E).	"ATRX	237	241	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""ATRX"", ""start_span"": 237, ""end_span"": 241, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Immunohistochemical staining revealed that Atrx was widely expressed in wild - type 7. 5 dpc embryos ( Figure 5B).	"Atrx	43	47	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Atrx"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We also observed very high levels of Atrx expression in trophoblast giant cells ( TGCs) surrounding the Reichert ' s membrane ( Figure 5E).	"Atrx	37	41	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Atrx"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Within the large nuclei of these TGCs, the typical nuclear association of Atrx with blocks of pericentromeric heterochromatin [ 15] was clearly observable.	"Atrx	74	78	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Atrx"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
To investigate whether the reduced size of the Atrxnull embryos was due to an increase in apoptosis, we analysed sections of paraffin - embedded 7. 5 dpc embryos by TdT - mediated dUTP nick end labeling ( TUNEL) assay ( Figure 6A).

These observations suggest that the mitotic defect observed in embryos is unlikely to be a direct, cell - autonomous effect of the absence of Atrx, and is more likely to be a secondary effect resulting from the failure to develop a normal trophoblast ( see below).

The number of Pl - 1 - expressing cells attached to the decidual wall after removal of the embryo is an indication of the density of trophoblast cells surrounding each implantation site [ 17].

After 5 d, individual blastocyst cultures were scored for the extent of primary trophoblast outgrowth, and the Atrx genotype and sex of the blastocyst were determined by PCR.

Taken together, these data suggest that loss of Atrx results in a defect in formation of the secondary trophoblast that is apparent from 7. 5 dpc.	"Atrx	48	52	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Atrx"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, in the extraembryonic compartment of AtrxWT / null carrier females, normal imprinted X - inactivation would be expected to result in silencing of the paternally derived AtrxWT allele, leaving only the Atrxnull allele on the active maternal X ( Xm) and thereby render the extraembryonic tissues null for full - length Atrx protein.

An alternative explanation for the unexpectedly severe phenotype we observed in mice is that the Atrx Delta 18 Delta neo deletion generated by Cre recombination completely ablates full - length Atrx protein ( Figure 2E).

Tetraploid aggregation experiments ( in which mutant embryos are rescued with wild - type extraembryonic tissues) might shed more light on the role of Atrx during later mouse development, but these issues can be more subtly dissected by combining the conditional Atrxflox allele that we have generated with different tissue - specific Cre transgenes.

As mentioned above, this approach has already revealed a critical role for Atrx during neuronal differentiation in adult mice [ 20].	"Atrx	75	79	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Atrx"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Atrx joins an expanding list of mouse genes for which targeted disruption results in peri - implantation lethality as a result of trophoblast or placental abnormalities ( reviewed in [ 25]).

It is noteworthy that, in the brain - specific Atrx knockout mice, the defect was observed in terminally differentiating neurons [ 20].	"Atrx	47	51	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Atrx"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Interestingly, the alpha - globin genes, the only confirmed transcriptional targets of regulation by human ATRX, are also highly expressed specifically during terminal differentiation within the erythroid lineage.

Silencing of the AtrxWT allele on Xp should render these females null for Atrx in the extraembryonic tissues, since the normally active Xm chromosome carries the Atrx Delta 18 Delta neo allele.	"Atrx	17	21	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Atrx"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Although not phenotypically normal, some Atrx carrier females developed to term and went on to reproduce.	"Atrx	41	45	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Atrx"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, the failure to correctly silence the paternally derived AtrxWT allele in the extraembryonic tissues of carrier females is consistent with our observations that in Atrxnull males, the Atrx protein plays an essential role in the development of the trophoblast and is necessary for survival in utero in the mouse.	"Atrx	62	66	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Atrx"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The survival of Atrx carrier females contrasts with the phenotypes seen in carriers of mutations of other murine X - linked genes known to be essential in the extraembryonic compartment.

Thus, unlike Atrx, these genes and / or their effects on cell growth are unable to circumvent the processes that ultimately cause all cells in the extraembryonic tissues to express only the maternally derived X chromosome.

This could explain why we have observed significant phenotypic variation among Atrx carrier females, with some carriers dying in utero by 9. 5 dpc ( Table 1) and others developing to term.

Another possible mechanism is that inactivation of the paternal X proceeds normally in all cells, but subsequently the Atrx gene within individual cells is reactivated.

Alternatively, in the absence of Atrx, the paternal allele may partially escape the normal process of silencing.	"Atrx	33	37	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Atrx"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

These ApcCKON / + mice were crossed with FLPe - deleter to generate ApcCKO / + mice that were heterozygous for the final Apc conditional ( ApcCKO) allele that removed the PGK - neomycin cassette and contains only the loxP sites in the introns flanking exon 14.

To assess the effect of deleting exon 14 in mice, both lines of ApcCKO / + mice were crossed with the Cre - deleter to generate the germline knockout line of Apc, designated Apc Delta 580 / +.

The transcript from loss of exon 14 results in a shift in the normal reading frame, resulting in a premature chain termination codon which, if utilized, would result in a truncated polypeptide that is 605 aa in length, of which the first 580 aa correspond to the normal Apc protein.

The K14 promoter is a commonly used epidermal cell promoter because of its expression by the mitotically active cells of the epidermis and its appendages in mature skin [ 18], but most notably it is active in embryonic ectoderm as early as the single layered ectodermal stage of embryonic day ( E) 9. 5 [ 19].

The aberrant hair follicle morphogenesis is evident as early as E14. 5 in mutant embryonic skin, by multiple apolarized expression of Shh throughout the epidermis ( Figure 5B), whereas that of control embryos was well polarized and regularly spaced ( Figure 5A).

The expression pattern of beta - catenin in embryos clearly demonstrated the formation of regular arrays of hair placodes in the normal embryonic skin ( Figure 5E and 5E '), but such regular patterning was lost, and often tightly clustered abnormal hair placodes were initiated in mutant embryonic skin ( Figure 5F ').

( 1) Although the K14 promoter itself is known to initiate the expression at E9. 5 and elevated dramatically by E13. 5 - E14. 5 [ 19, 31], many factors could influence the expression of promoter / transgene construct in transgenic mice.

We show here that this mutation results in a dramatic reduction in ITPR1 in cells from these patients.	"ITPR1	67	72	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""ITPR1"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
These data show convincingly that ITPR1 deletion underlies spinocerebellar ataxia 15 in humans.	"ITPR1	34	39	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""ITPR1"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Here we describe this effort and the discovery of deletion at the ITPR1 locus as a cause of this disorder in mice and of spinocerebellar ataxia 15 ( SCA15) in humans.	"ITPR1	66	71	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""ITPR1"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
During the generation of a line of mice with knockout of the gene Park7 we noted an early movement disorder that was inherited independently of targeting vector transmission.	"Park7	66	71	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Park7"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Furthermore, this phenotype was similar, although less severe, to that described in a mouse line with targeted deletion of Itpr1, where ataxia was described as a prominent feature [ 4].	"Itpr1	123	128	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Itpr1"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
As with the Itpr1opt / opt mice, where the deletion of exons 43 and 44 is also predicted to leave the translational reading frame unaffected, the in - frame Itpr1 Delta 18 / Delta 18 deletion mutation results in markedly decreased levels of Itpr1 in cerebellar Purkinje cells.	"Itpr1	12	17	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Itpr1"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Although missense mutation of ITPR1 had previously been ruled out [ 2] and the mode of inheritance was inconsistent with that seen in the Itpr1 Delta 18 and Itpr1opt mice, the phenotypic presence of ataxia in the mice led us to reexamine this candidate gene as a possible cause of SCA15.	"ITPR1	30	35	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""ITPR1"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We performed two experiments concurrently in three affected members of this family: sequence analysis of the coding exons of ITPR1 and high - density genome - wide SNP genotyping.	"ITPR1	125	130	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""ITPR1"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Given the location of this alteration it is unlikely to effect the expression or splicing of ITPR1.	"ITPR1	93	98	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""ITPR1"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
To further establish genetic deletion at ITPR1 as the cause of SCA15 we analyzed two additional families with an inherited cerebellar ataxia similar to that described in the AUS1 family, ascertained through neurology clinics in London, United Kingdom.	"ITPR1	41	46	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""ITPR1"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The site of mutation is of interest, particularly the fact that in each of the three families the telomeric end of the deletion is anchored between exons 3 and 4 of SUMF1; sequence searches failed to identify any repeat sequences that might explain this phenomenon.	"SUMF1	165	170	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""SUMF1"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 170, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Homozygous mutation of SUMF1 results in autosomal recessive multiple sulfatase deficiency, a metabolic disorder characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, deafness, and developmental delay [ 6, 7].	"SUMF1	23	28	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""SUMF1"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Conversely, mutation of ITPR1 is biologically plausible as a cause of ataxia: the protein is highly expressed in Purkinje cells; as we have shown here, mice with mutation at this locus present with ataxia; and perturbed Ca2 + signaling has previously been implicated in the etiology of ataxia, notably in episodic ataxia type 2 and SCA6 [ 8].	"ITPR1	24	29	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""ITPR1"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Itpr1 contains three domains, an N - terminal inositol triphosphate binding domain, a coupling domain, and a C - terminal transmembrane domain; it also contains two protein kinase A phosphorylation sites and an ATP - binding site.	"Itpr1	0	5	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Itpr1"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Itpr1 is coupled to Ca2 + channels and facilitates Ca2 + release from the endoplasmic reticulum after binding by the intracellular second messenger inositol 1, 4, 5 - triphosphate [ 9].	"Itpr1	0	5	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Itpr1"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Itpr1 is enriched in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum [ 4].	"Itpr1	0	5	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Itpr1"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
ITPR1 mutations have more than one potential pathogenic mechanism.	"ITPR1	0	5	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""ITPR1"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
First, the disease may be a result of haploinsufficiency at ITPR1; this concept is consistent with the observation that heterozygous deletion leads to a later onset disorder in humans, whereas homozygous deletion in mice leads to an early onset disorder, able to be expressed within the much shorter life span of the mouse.	"ITPR1	60	65	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""ITPR1"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Clearly, the identification of distinct ITPR1 mutations underlying SCA15 will help elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of this disorder.	"ITPR1	40	45	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""ITPR1"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The data provided by these approaches provide compelling evidence that heterozygous deletion of ITPR1 causes SCA15.	"ITPR1	96	101	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""ITPR1"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Given that SCA16 and autosomal dominant congenital nonprogressive ataxia have both recently been mapped to regions overlapping with the SCA15 locus [ 10, 11], ITPR1 is a gene of importance for screening in these families.	"ITPR1	159	164	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""ITPR1"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 164, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This revealed the Itpr1opt / opt mouse, in which disease is caused by homozygous deletion mutation of exons 43 and 44 of Itpr1.	"Itpr1	18	23	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Itpr1"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Primer pairs were designed to sequence each of the coding exons and at least 50 bp of each flanking intronic sequence of Itpr1.	"Itpr1	121	126	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Itpr1"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

Specificity of the Itpr1 antibodies was verified by preabsorption control experiments.	"Itpr1	19	24	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Itpr1"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

The coding exons and at least 50 bp of flanking introns of ITPR1 were PCR amplified and sequenced using dye - terminator sequencing ( BigDye version 3. 1; Applied Biosystems, http: / / www. appliedbiosystems. com).

In order to rule out the possibility that the observed deletion within ITPR1 was a benign copy number variant we examined log R ratio and B allele frequency metrics of HumanHap550 genotyping data at this locus from 577 individuals of Northern European descent from North America and Europe, produced by us as a part of an ongoing study.
