BRCA2 appears to function in recombination via interactions with the major eukaryotic recombinase RAD51 [ 1, 2, 3].

We briefly review the context in which the two studies were carried out, we comment on the results presented, and we discuss models designed to account for the role of BRCA2 in RAD51 - mediated repair.

BRCA1 and BRCA2 form discrete nuclear foci during the S phase and after exposure to DNA damaging agents [ 9, 10, 11].

Cell lines defective in either BRCA1 or BRCA2 are sensitive to damaging agents that form double - strand breaks ( DSBs), as are other cell lines defective in recombinational repair ( reviewed in [ 15]).

BRCA2 interacts with the RAD51 recombinase via direct protein - protein contacts [ 16, 17, 18, 19].

Biochemical analysis also showed interaction between BRCA1 and RAD51, although these detected interactions may have been indirect [ 9].

The BRC repeats of BRCA2 are responsible for direct RAD51 interaction.

Cells lacking BRCA1 / 2 fail to form damage - induced subnuclear RAD51 foci with normal efficiency, suggesting that these proteins are required for the formation of recombinase complexes at the sites of DNA damage [ 20, 21].

Moynahan et al [ 24] have used such a GFP recombination substrate to demonstrate that cells with defective BRCA2 protein are deficient in their ability to repair the I - SceI - induced DSB through homologous recombination.	"BRCA2	107	112	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"I - SceI	166	174	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BRCA2"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""I - SceI"", ""start_span"": 166, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The authors indicate that the level of I - SceI - induced recombination in CAPAN - 1 is over 100 - fold less than that seen using other ( BRCA2 +) human tumor cell lines.

In these experiments, the derivative expressing full - length BRCA2 yielded 10 - fold more recombinants than controls expressing only truncated BRCA2 ( S. Powell, personal communication, 2001).

Conversely, the BRCA2 defect in CAPAN - 1 could be fully responsible for the 100 - fold defect in recombination if the level of BRCA2 complementation observed by Powell was incomplete.

The second paper providing evidence, by Davies et al [ 26], is a biochemical study of the interaction between the homologous recombinase RAD51 and a peptide consisting of one of the eight BRC repeats from human BRCA2.	"RAD51	137	142	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"human BRCA2	205	216	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""RAD51"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""human BRCA2"", ""start_span"": 205, ""end_span"": 216, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
These experiments raise the possibility that the full - length BRCA2 protein could act as a negative regulator of inappropriate RAD51 - DNA interaction.	"BRCA2	63	68	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"RAD51	128	133	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BRCA2"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""RAD51"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The final experiment reported by Davies et al [ 26] is particularly important with respect to understanding the mechanism ( s) through which BRCA2 promotes RAD51 - dependent recombination.	"BRCA2	141	146	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"RAD51	156	161	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BRCA2"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""RAD51"", ""start_span"": 156, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In the absence of this interaction with BRCA2, RAD51 might exist in a form that is not capable of being recruited into a functional repair complex when damage occurs.	"BRCA2	40	45	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"RAD51	47	52	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BRCA2"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""RAD51"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Alternatively, or in addition, suppression of RAD51 - ssDNA interaction might be important for preventing RAD51 from binding to the regions of ssDNA that form during normal DNA replication.	"RAD51	46	51	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"RAD51	106	111	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""RAD51"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""RAD51"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Several proteins that interact with RAD51 are thought to ' mediate ' assembly of RAD51 at sites of DNA damage ( reviewed in [ 30]).	"RAD51	36	41	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"RAD51	81	86	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""RAD51"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""RAD51"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Finally, it is important to note that the two models for the function of the BRCA2 - RAD51 interaction shown in Figure 2 are not mutually exclusive.	"BRCA2	77	82	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"RAD51	85	90	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BRCA2"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""RAD51"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Further experiments are clearly required to clarify the functional interactions between BRCA2 and RAD51 during recombinational repair.	"BRCA2	88	93	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"RAD51	98	103	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BRCA2"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""RAD51"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
It should be relatively straightforward to determine whether the role of BRCA2 is limited to transporting RAD51 to the nucleus.

However, several technical obstacles, including the large size of BRCA2, promise to make biochemical characterization of BRCA2 function difficult.

Chromosomal DNA is shown as pairs of straight lines, Rad51 as open circles, and BRCA2 as grey bars.

In this model, BRCA2 is not required for assembly of functional complexes at damaged sites, only to prevent a substantial fraction of Rad51 from being sequestered in a nonfunctional form.	"BRCA2	15	20	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Rad51	134	139	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BRCA2"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Rad51"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In a BRCA2 - defective cell, mutant Rad51 becomes associated with DNA at random sites and is therefore not readily recruited to sites of damage.

The limited expression of neurotrophins in the cochlea of Brn3c null mice suffices to support many sensory neurons, particularly in the cochlea, until birth.

The initial development and partial differentiation of hair cells in Brn3c mutants could possibly lead to some neurotrophin expression in these cells to sustain sensory neurons through embryonic development and beyond.

Data on various single and compound neurotrophin null mutants have shown that the loss of a specific neurotrophin leads to topologically restricted loss of sensory neurons in the embryonic ear [ 4, 5].

The BDNF signal in the utricle was clearly centered on the hair cells in the control animal but some aggregation of silver grains appeared also in the Brn3c null mutants ( data not shown).

The expression of BDNF and NT - 3 mRNA is shown in the P0 vestibular sensory epithelia.

Note the prominent BDNF expression in the hair cell region ( HaC) of control canal ( b) and saccule ( d) and low levels of expression in the Brn3c null mice ( a, c) over immature hair cells ( iHC).

The NT - 3 expression is much more diffuse in both control and Brn3c mutant littermates.

In the cochlea, the BDNF signal was very weak in the base in both the control ( Fig. 9b) and the Brn3c null littermates ( Fig. 9a).

However, there was a surprisingly strong NT - 3 signal over the organ of Corti in the apex of Brn3c null littermates ( Fig. 9c) that closely matched the signal found in the control littermates ( Fig. 9d).

The NT - 3 signal in the area of the cochlea that corresponds to the IHC ' s persisted at least until P8 in the apex of Brn3c null mice ( Fig. 9e, 9f).

Note the limited expression of BDNF in the basal turn of both wildtype and mutant littermates ( a, b) and the much stronger expression of NT - 3 in the apex over the region of the inner hair cells in both wildtype and control littermates ( c, d).

We will explore five points in this discussion: How the limited expression of neurotrophins relates to the apparent survival of primary neurons until P8; how the known absence of apical hair cells and of classical neurotrophins can be related to the presence of large numbers of apical turn spiral neurons; how absence of differentiated hair cells affects afferent and efferent targeting; and how these data possibly relate to other mutant animals and to children born with profound hearing loss.

Moreover, all of the neurotrophin / neurotrophin receptor null mutants studied to date eliminate expression in both the peripheral target and the brain simultaneously and achieve their effects in late embryos.

We suggest that limited expression of neurotrophins in the immature target leads to retention of primary neurons and their afferent fibers in newborn and early postnatal Brn3c null mice.

Despite this reduction, some, apparently biologically significant low levels of neurotrophins are apparently expressed in all sensory epithelia in embryonic Brn3c null mutants.

Since BDNF appears to be exclusively produced by hair cells [ 6, 7, 20], the lack of terminal differentiation of hair cells appears to be accompanied by only limited expression of BDNF, as is the case in the canal cristae ( Fig. 8).	"BDNF	6	10	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BDNF	180	184	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BDNF"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BDNF"", ""start_span"": 180, ""end_span"": 184, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Past research has shown that in BDNF and trkB null mutants this innervation to canal cristae is lost before birth [ 6, 13].

The situation in the utricle, saccule and cochlea is less clear as both BDNF and NT - 3 are expressed [ 6, 7].

This expression of NT - 3 in supporting cells in embryos and neonates may even preserve in Brn3c null mutants the numerous spiral sensory neurons in the apex of 8 - day old animals ( Figs. 3, 4).

Past work has shown that BDNF and NT - 3 appear to shift in their expression into inner hair cells around birth or are lost in the ear and other parts of the nervous system [ 6, 10, 20, 23].

However, known neurotrophins are largely absent in the adult cochleae [ 4] and significant amounts of neurotrophin expression appear to develop only in postnatal animals in the CNS [ 24].

It has been shown that the differentiation of pillar cells depends on activation of Fgfr3 [ 26] by FGF ' s, probably Fgf8, a factor produced by developing and mature inner hair cells [ 18, 27].

Salzer et al. recently reported the presence of the 47 kDa isoform of annexin A7 and its partner sorcin in micro - and nanovesicles derived from red blood cells where they are located in the lumen and are also enriched in membrane rafts [ 7].

Red blood cells, which were thought to be devoid of annexin A7, were recently shown to harbor the 47 kDa isoform together with its binding partner sorcin [ 7].

[ 37] that annexin A7 mediates membrane aggregation also suggested that annexin A7 is an essential component during vesiculation.

Similarly, the high abundance of annexin A7 in micro - and nanovesicles might be fortuitous as a significant percentage of the red blood cell membrane, with which annexin A7 associates when the Ca2 + levels rise, appears to be involved in the formation of exovesicles.

Nevertheless, these immunoblot results support our analysis of brain tissue extracts that the antibody against Acdp1 C - terminus specifically recognizes Acdp - 1.

There were no significant differences of liver cholesterol or plant sterol contents between Abcg8 + / + and Abcg8 + / - mice.

As expected, Abcg8 mRNA expression levels were undetectable in the Abcg8 - / - mice and were reduced by ~ 50% in the heterozygous mice, relative to wild - type mice.

To verify whether the mRNA changes resulted in alteration of the enzyme activity changes, liver samples were analyzed for HMG - CoA reductase activity and Cyp7a1 activity ( Figure 4b).

In contrast, although the Cyp7a1 mRNA expression levels were essentially unchanged in the knockout mouse, Cyp7a1 activity was significantly decreased by 37% ( P < 0. 01).

Western blotting of liver total membrane preparations using the three separately - developed anti - Abcg5 / sterolin - 1 antibodies showed different results.

As has been previously published, Abcg5 / sterolin - 1 exists in two separate forms, the ' immature ' 75 kDa protein and a fully glycosylated ' mature ' 93 kDa protein [ 18, 30].	"Abcg5	34	39	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"sterolin - 1	42	54	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Abcg5"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""sterolin - 1"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Using the SC anti - Abcg5 / sterolin - 1 peptide antibody, a 75 kDa band is detected ( Figure 5a).	"Abcg5	20	25	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"sterolin - 1	28	40	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Abcg5"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""sterolin - 1"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The AMC antibody detects the ' mature ' form of Abcg5 / sterolin - 1 in wild - type animals but not the knockouts.	"Abcg5	48	53	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"sterolin - 1	56	68	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Abcg5"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""sterolin - 1"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Interestingly, the ' immature ' 75 kDa band is detected by this antibody but the band shifts with Endo - H and PNGase F treatment ( Figure 5b).	"Endo - H	98	106	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"PNGase F	111	119	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Endo - H"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""PNGase F"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The UTSW antibody detects the ' mature ' and ' immature ' forms of Abcg5 / sterolin - 1 in wild - type animals but detects no forms in the knockout mouse ( Figure 5c).	"Abcg5	67	72	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"sterolin - 1	75	87	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Abcg5"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""sterolin - 1"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
What does hold true for all antibodies used against Abcg5 / sterolin - 1 is the detection of a 75 kDa band.	"Abcg5	52	57	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"sterolin - 1	60	72	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Abcg5"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""sterolin - 1"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In acute transfection studies, the SC antibody recognized over - expressed mouse Abcg5 / sterolin - 1 in COS - 1 cells, but not mouse Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 ( Figure 6b, 6c).	"mouse Abcg5 / sterolin - 1	75	101	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"mouse Abcg8 / sterolin - 2	128	154	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""mouse Abcg5 / sterolin - 1"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""mouse Abcg8 / sterolin - 2"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The pattern of staining of Abcg5 / sterolin - 1 in the intestinal sections is clearly apical and localized to the villi of the enterocytes ( Figure 6g, 6h, 6i).	"Abcg5	27	32	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"sterolin - 1	35	47	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Abcg5"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""sterolin - 1"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Loss of Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 does not seem to affect this pattern of staining.	"Abcg8	8	13	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"sterolin - 2	16	28	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Abcg8"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""sterolin - 2"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
To further confirm that the antibody used recognizes Abcg5 / sterolin - 1; this pattern is blocked if the antibody is pre - incubated with the peptide to which it was raised ( Figure 6f).	"Abcg5	53	58	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"sterolin - 1	61	73	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Abcg5"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""sterolin - 1"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
To further confirm that Abcg5 / sterolin - 1 expression is preserved and may be apical, immunohistochemistry was performed in Amsterdam using the AMC antibody to stain liver sections from wild - type and knockout mice [ 30].	"Abcg5	24	29	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"sterolin - 1	32	44	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Abcg5"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""sterolin - 1"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Again, both proteins are apically localized in liver sections from wild - type mice and this pattern is essentially unperturbed in liver from knockout mice, although the expression level of Abcg5 / sterolin - 1 seems to be less robust qualitatively ( Figure 6l, 6m).	"Abcg5	190	195	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"sterolin - 1	198	210	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Abcg5"", ""start_span"": 190, ""end_span"": 195, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""sterolin - 1"", ""start_span"": 198, ""end_span"": 210, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
To further confirm the apical expression of Abcg5 / sterolin - 1 in the knockout mice, the UTSW antibody was used to stain liver sections of wild - type and knockout mice.	"Abcg5	44	49	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"sterolin - 1	52	64	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Abcg5"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""sterolin - 1"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Again, there is apical expression of Abcg5 / sterolin - 1 in both wild - type and knockout livers ( Figure 7a, 7b).	"Abcg5	37	42	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"sterolin - 1	45	57	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Abcg5"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""sterolin - 1"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Biliary secretion of bile salts, sterol and phospholipids in Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 deficient mice	"Abcg8	61	66	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"sterolin - 2	69	81	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Abcg8"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""sterolin - 2"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In the heterozygous mice, sterol secretion increased to reach a maximal level of about 50% of the wild type suggesting that Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 is a rate - limiting step for biliary ' cholesterol ' secretion.	"Abcg8	124	129	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"sterolin - 2	132	144	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Abcg8"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""sterolin - 2"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
For example, in humans, the activity of HMG - CoA reductase and CYP7a1 have been reported to be low [ 7, 39].	"HMG - CoA reductase	40	59	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"CYP7a1	64	70	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""HMG - CoA reductase"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""CYP7a1"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Furthermore, complete loss of Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 results in an inability to secrete cholesterol into bile, although secretion of sitosterol seemed to be preserved.	"Abcg8	30	35	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"sterolin - 2	38	50	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Abcg8"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""sterolin - 2"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Despite this reservation, the finding that sitosterol is present in the bile suggests that plant sterols may be secreted independent of Abcg8 / sterolin - 2.	"Abcg8	136	141	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"sterolin - 2	144	156	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Abcg8"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""sterolin - 2"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Collectively these data suggest that Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 is necessary for hepatobiliary cholesterol secretion in mice.	"Abcg8	37	42	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"sterolin - 2	45	57	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Abcg8"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""sterolin - 2"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Hepatic levels of GC - measured cholesterol were greatly reduced in Abcg8 - / - mice compared to wild - type mice, yet mRNA levels of HMG - CoA reductase and enzyme activity are also reduced without any significant change in mRNA of the Srebps.	"Abcg8	68	73	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"HMG - CoA reductase	134	153	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Abcg8"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""HMG - CoA reductase"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 deficient mice also allow us to examine the role of this protein in biliary sterol secretion.	"Abcg8	0	5	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"sterolin - 2	8	20	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Abcg8"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""sterolin - 2"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The bile is sterol poor and upon stimulation by increasing bile salt excretion, Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 deficient mice cannot respond, in contrast to the wild - type mice.	"Abcg8	80	85	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"sterolin - 2	88	100	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Abcg8"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""sterolin - 2"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 is necessary for cholesterol secretion but not necessary for plant sterol secretion.	"Abcg8	6	11	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"sterolin - 2	14	26	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Abcg8"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""sterolin - 2"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Recently, Kosters et al. reported that Abcg5 / Abcg8 mRNA expression in a variety of different mouse strains correlated with biliary cholesterol secretion rates [ 30].	"Abcg5	39	44	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Abcg8	47	52	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Abcg5"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Abcg8"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In their studies, although diosgenin - fed mice showed a marked increase in biliary cholesterol output, mRNA levels of Abcg5 and Abcg8 were not altered.	"Abcg5	119	124	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Abcg8	129	134	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Abcg5"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Abcg8"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Using Western blot analyses, the protein level of Abcg5 was also not altered by diosgenin, although Abcg8 was not measured.	"Abcg5	50	55	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Abcg8	100	105	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Abcg5"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Abcg8"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
While biliary cholesterol secretion is not completely absent in the Abcg8 - deficient mice it would appear that sterolin - 2 plays a major role in this process.	"Abcg8	68	73	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"sterolin - 2	112	124	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Abcg8"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""sterolin - 2"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus knocking out Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 alone is equivalent to a functional loss of both sterolins.	"Abcg8	18	23	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"sterolin - 2	26	38	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Abcg8"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""sterolin - 2"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Interestingly, in a report of Abcg5 / Abcg8 localization in canine gallbladder epithelial cells, these two proteins were found intracellularly under baseline conditions [ 44].	"Abcg5	30	35	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Abcg8	38	43	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Abcg5"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Abcg8"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In these studies the UTSW anti - Abcg5 / sterolin - 1 antibody was used.	"Abcg5	33	38	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"sterolin - 1	41	53	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Abcg5"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""sterolin - 1"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
These data strongly support the direct role of Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 as a key player in biliary cholesterol secretion, although biliary sitosterol secretion was apparently preserved.	"Abcg8	47	52	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"sterolin - 2	55	67	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Abcg8"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""sterolin - 2"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
These data suggest that there are mechanisms other than Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 that allow for the secretion of sitosterol into bile.

This was achieved by targeted expression of an activated form of peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor delta ( PPAR delta) in skeletal muscle, which induces a switch to form increased numbers of type I muscle fibers.

This conversion of muscle fiber from type IIb to type IIa and type I is likely to be mediated by a calcium signaling pathway that involves calcineurin, calmodulin - dependent kinase, and the transcriptional cofactor Peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - gamma coactivator 1 alpha ( PGC - 1 alpha) ( Naya et al. 2000; Olson and Williams 2000; Lin et al. 2002; Wu et al. 2002).

A role of PPAR delta in muscle fiber was suggested by its enhanced expression -- at levels 10 - fold and 50 - fold greater than PPAR alpha and gamma isoforms, respectively ( unpublished data).

An examination of PPAR delta in different muscle fibers reveals a significantly higher level in type I muscle ( soleus) relative to type II - rich muscle ( extensor digitorum longus) or type I and type II mixed muscle ( gastrocnemius) ( Figure 1A); this expression pattern closely resembles that of PGC - 1 alpha ( Lin et al. 2002).

As shown in Figure 1D for gastrocnemius muscle, VP16 - PPAR delta fusion protein was produced at a level similar to that of endogenous PPAR delta in wild - type littermates.	"PPAR delta	55	65	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"PPAR delta	135	145	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""PPAR delta"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""PPAR delta"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The substantial increase of endogenous PPAR delta may have been caused by a switch to type I fiber ( see below), which intrinsically expresses higher levels of PPAR delta ( Figure 1A and 1B).	"PPAR delta	39	49	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"PPAR delta	160	170	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""PPAR delta"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""PPAR delta"", ""start_span"": 160, ""end_span"": 170, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In addition to myoglobin, mitochondrial components for electron transfer ( cytochrome c and cytochrome c oxidase [ COX] II and IV) and fatty - acid beta - oxidation enzymes were elevated ( Figure 3A; unpublished data).

These effects appear to be direct consequences of PPAR delta activation, as levels of PGC - 1 alpha, a coactivator involved in muscle fiber switch and mitochondrial biogenesis ( Wu et al. 1999; Lehman et al. 2000; Lin et al. 2002), remained unchanged.	"PPAR delta	50	60	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"PGC - 1 alpha	86	99	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""PPAR delta"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
As shown in Figure 3D, the characteristic type I fiber proteins, such as myoglobin and cytochrome c and b, were significantly increased.

The muscle phenotypes described here are remarkably similar to those of transgenic mice expressing either calcineurin, calmodulin - dependent kinase, or PGC - 1 alpha ( Naya et al. 2000; Lin et al. 2002; Wu et al. 2002), indicating that PPAR delta could be one of the hypothetical downstream transcription factors of these pathways.

Thus, PPAR delta activation, rather than merely an increase of PPAR delta levels, is an essential element for fiber switching and its associated functional manifestations.

A second model is that exercise may induce expression of PGC - 1 alpha ( Goto et al. 2000) and thereby activate PPAR delta.

This is consistent with previous work in which we have shown that PGC - 1 alpha physically associates with PPAR delta in muscle tissue and can powerfully activate it even in the absence of ligands ( Wang et al. 2003).

Together, these data indicate that PPAR delta and its ligands comprise a key molecular switch to regulate muscle fiber specification, obesity resistance, insulin sensitivity, and, most surprisingly, physical endurance.

However, Lamp 1 and Lamp 2 total protein levels were similar in wild - type and homozygous CbCln3 Delta ex7 / 8 cells by immunoblot analysis, indicating the altered signal likely reflects dispersed lysosomes or altered localization and / or epitope availability ( data not shown).

Abnormal cathepsin D localization and processing in homozygous CbCln3 Delta ex7 / 8 cells and Cln3 Delta ex7 / 8 mice likely reflects altered vesicular trafficking and / or lysosomal pH, which is known to impact cathepsin D processing [ 14, 16].	"cathepsin D	9	20	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cathepsin D	212	223	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""cathepsin D"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cathepsin D"", ""start_span"": 212, ""end_span"": 223, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Indeed, CLN3 overexpression in HEK - 293 cells altered lysosomal pH and cathepsin D processing [ 17], and lysosomal pH homeostasis is disrupted in JNCL [ 10, 15].	"CLN3	8	12	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cathepsin D	72	83	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""CLN3"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cathepsin D"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Nevertheless, despite the cathepsin D protein alterations that are observed in homozygous CbCln3 Delta ex7 / 8 cells, cathepsin D enzymatic activity does not appear to be reduced.	"cathepsin D	26	37	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"cathepsin D	118	129	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""cathepsin D"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""cathepsin D"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, decreased cathepsin D activity is unlikely to account for subunit c accumulation in JNCL.

These observations argue that membrane trafficking defects do not result from excessive subunit c accumulation compromising the lysosome, but rather are early events in the disease process preceding subunit c accumulation.

Battenin immunostaining in homozygous CbCln3 Delta ex7 / 8 neuronal precursors is significantly reduced in abundance, but mutant signal also co - localizes with endosomal markers suggesting mutant battenin protein with C - terminal epitopes is trafficked similar to wild - type protein.

In other studies, CLN3 / battenin protein localization has been reported to partially overlap with late endosomes and lysosomes in non - neuronal cells [ 7], and to lysosomes, synaptosomes [ 8] and endosomes [ 9, 25] in neurons.

We found that transforming growth factor beta 2 signaling is necessary to transiently induce the transcription factor Snail and activate the Ras - mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK) pathway in the bud.

The downstream changes elicited through convergence of these two early signaling pathways include down - regulation of the gene encoding E - cadherin, the prototypical epithelial cadherin that forms the transmembrane core of intercellular adherens junctions ( AJs) [ 5].

We subsequently showed that when E - cadherin is transgenically elevated in mouse skin, hair follicle morphogenesis is blocked, suggesting that E - cadherin down - regulation is a critical event in governing the adhesion dynamics necessary for budding morphogenesis [ 4].

At sites of cell - cell contact, however, E - cadherin - beta - catenin complexes recruit alpha - catenin, which in turn coordinates the associated actin polymerization dynamics necessary to stabilize nascent AJs and integrate the cytoskeleton across an epithelial sheet [ 6, 7, 8].	"E - cadherin	42	54	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"beta - catenin	57	71	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""E - cadherin"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""beta - catenin"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
alpha - Catenin also binds to the class III Lin - 1, Isl - 1, Mec - 3 ( LIM) protein Ajuba ( a member of the zyxin family of proteins), which appears to function dually in both adhesion and in activation of the Ras - mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK) pathway [ 9, 10].

Both activity of Snail and down - regulation of E - cadherin play pivotal roles in epithelial to mesenchymal transitions ( EMTs), typified by the transformation of polarized, adhering epithelial cells into motile mesenchymal cells [ 16, 17].

In the present study, we discovered that Snail is expressed briefly at an early stage of hair bud formation, when E - cadherin down - regulation and activation of proliferation take place.

In the absence of TGF - beta 2 signaling and Snail gene expression, hair placodes can form, but further follicle down - growth is blocked.

Furthermore, the immunohistochemical data paralleled our Snail in situ hybridization data revealing transient Snail expression at the hair bud stage ( Figure 1A).

As judged by immunofluorescence with antibodies against the proliferating nuclear antigen Ki67, the timing of Snail expression coincided with the stage at which the developing follicle enhanced its proliferation and down - growth ( Figure 1F).

The striking spike of Snail expression coincident with hair bud formation and enhanced proliferation prompted us to examine the consequences of ectopically expressing Snail elsewhere in mouse skin epidermis.

To distinguish Tg from endogenous Snail, we used the HA - epitope, shown previously not to alter Snail ' s transcriptional activity [ 12].

The mosaic morphology was reflected at the level of Tg Snail protein, with only the hyperthickened regions expressing nuclear HA - tagged Snail ( Figure 2C).

In these regions, immunofluorescence staining of E - cadherin and alpha - catenin were markedly diminished.

Interestingly, however, despite appreciable immunofluorescence, localization of beta - catenin and Ajuba appeared to be largely cytoplasmic rather than at cell - cell borders ( Figure 4A insets).

Coexpression of E - cadherin with Snail appeared to abrogate this effect.

We next turned to the presence of cytoplasmic Ajuba for a possible mechanistic link to the proliferative increase in our Snail Tg epidermis.	"Ajuba	46	51	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Snail	121	126	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ajuba"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Given the increase in pMAPK staining in Tg skin, we examined the possibility that Ajuba might have changed its binding partner in Snail - expressing epidermis.

Indeed, when serum - starved keratinocytes were transiently transfected with an Ajuba expression vector, the levels of pMAPK were not only elevated but also comparable to those transfected with the K14 - HASnail transgene ( Figure 4F).	"Ajuba	80	85	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"K14	198	201	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ajuba"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""K14"", ""start_span"": 198, ""end_span"": 201, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Ajuba ' s pre - LIM domain is the segment that associates with Grb - 2 ' s Src - homology 3 domain [ 9].

Probing the Regulation of Snail Gene Expression Reveals an Essential Link to TGF - beta 2 Signaling in the Developing Hair Bud	"Snail	26	31	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"TGF - beta 2	77	89	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""TGF - beta 2"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The temporal spike of Snail mRNA expression in the hair bud prompted us to consider what factor ( s) may be regulating the Snail gene.	"Snail	22	27	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Snail	123	128	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, despite essential roles for Wnts and noggin in hair follicle specification [ 4, 29, 30], our studies did not support an essential role for these signals in governing Snail expression in keratinocytes.	"noggin	43	49	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Snail	172	177	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""noggin"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 172, ""end_span"": 177, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
TGF - beta 1 has been shown to induce Snail family members in hepatocytes and heart [ 15, 31].	"TGF - beta 1	0	12	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Snail	38	43	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""TGF - beta 1"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Of the loss - of - function mutations generated in each of the TGF - beta genes, only the TGF - beta 2 null state blocked follicle development at the hair bud stage [ 32].	"TGF - beta	63	73	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"TGF - beta 2	90	102	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""TGF - beta"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""TGF - beta 2"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, we turned towards addressing whether TGF - beta 2 might be involved in regulating Snail expression in keratinocytes isolated from the basal layer of the epidermis.	"TGF - beta 2	43	55	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Snail	88	93	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""TGF - beta 2"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Interestingly, treatment of cultured keratinocytes with as little as 5 ng / ml of TGF - beta 2 caused a rapid and transient induction of Snail ( Figure 5B).	"TGF - beta 2	82	94	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Snail	137	142	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""TGF - beta 2"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The induction of Snail appeared to be specific for the active form of the growth factor, as pretreatment of TGF - beta 2 for 10 min at 100 degrees C obliterated the response [ Figure 5B, lanes marked ( -)].	"Snail	17	22	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"TGF - beta 2	108	120	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""TGF - beta 2"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, although Snail expression correlated with phosphorylated SMAD2 ( pSMAD2) induction, its decline seemed to rely on secondary downstream events.	"Snail	15	20	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"SMAD2	63	68	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""SMAD2"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
At 2 d after transient transfection, keratinocytes were treated with TGF - beta 2 ( t = 0) and then assayed for transgene activity over the same time course in which we had observed Snail protein induction.	"TGF - beta 2	69	81	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Snail	182	187	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""TGF - beta 2"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 182, ""end_span"": 187, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Within 0. 5 h of TGF - beta 2 treatment, Snail promoter activity had increased 3 - fold, and by 2 h, it peaked to approximately 10 - fold over control levels ( Figure 5D).	"TGF - beta 2	17	29	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Snail	41	46	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""TGF - beta 2"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The kinetics of Snail promoter activity closely paralleled those observed for Snail protein induction.	"Snail	16	21	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Snail	78	83	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Moreover, the downstream effector of TGF - beta 2 signaling, pSMAD2, was also expressed in WT, but not TGF - beta 2 - null, hair buds ( Figure 6B).	"TGF - beta 2	37	49	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"TGF - beta 2	103	115	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""TGF - beta 2"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""TGF - beta 2"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
As judged by immunohistochemistry, Snail protein was absent from E17. 5 skin of TGF - beta 2 - null embryos but not from that of control littermates ( Figure 6C).	"Snail	35	40	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"TGF - beta 2	80	92	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""TGF - beta 2"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This effect appeared to be exerted at the transcriptional level, since Snail mRNAs were also not found in TGF - beta 2 null hair buds under conditions in which the signal was readily detected in the hair buds of littermate skin ( Figure 6D).	"Snail	71	76	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"TGF - beta 2	106	118	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""TGF - beta 2"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Taken together, these results provide compelling evidence that TGF - beta 2 is functionally important for inducing Snail gene expression in a pSMAD - dependent manner in developing hair buds.	"TGF - beta 2	63	75	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Snail	115	120	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""TGF - beta 2"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Consistent with this notion, basement membrane remodeling still took place in the TGF - beta 2 - null buds, as judged by immunofluorescence with antibodies against beta 4 integrin, an integral component of keratinocyte - mediated adhesion to its underlying basement membrane ( Figure 6F).	"TGF - beta 2	82	94	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"beta 4 integrin	164	179	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""TGF - beta 2"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""beta 4 integrin"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 179, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In contrast, TGF - beta 2 signaling appeared to be an important factor for the early proliferation that occurs in the developing hair buds, as judged by anti - Ki67 and anti - pMAPK immunofluorescence ( Figure 6F and 6G).	"TGF - beta 2	13	25	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Ki67	160	164	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""TGF - beta 2"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Ki67"", ""start_span"": 160, ""end_span"": 164, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
These data suggest that during hair follicle morphogenesis, TGF - beta 2 functions subsequently to Wnt / noggin - mediated determination of hair fate.	"TGF - beta 2	60	72	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"noggin	105	111	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""TGF - beta 2"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""noggin"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, in contrast to TGF - beta 1 - null skin, which exhibits an extended growing phase of postnatal hair follicles, TGF - beta 2 - null skin displays an embryonic block in follicle bud progression [ 32].	"TGF - beta 1	24	36	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"TGF - beta 2	120	132	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""TGF - beta 1"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""TGF - beta 2"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
An additional point worth mentioning is that prolonged expression of Tg Snail in postnatal skin resulted in morphological and biochemical signs of epithelial to mesenchymal transitions ( unpublished data), underscoring why transient Snail expression may be so important during normal hair follicle morphogenesis [ 18].	"Snail	72	77	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Snail	233	238	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 233, ""end_span"": 238, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
At first glance, the sparsity in hair coat of K14 - Snail Tg mice seemed indicative of a defect in follicle formation ( see Figure 2A).	"K14	46	49	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Snail	52	57	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""K14"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The K14 promoter is also less active in the ORS than epidermis and hence this might also account for the lack of apparent response of the ORS to ectopic Snail.	"K14	4	7	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Snail	153	158	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""K14"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In the course of these studies, we also noted that Snail can also contribute to this process in keratinocytes in vitro, and our present studies revealed that Snail is expressed at the right place and time to be physiologically relevant in the process.	"Snail	51	56	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Snail	158	163	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 158, ""end_span"": 163, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The corresponding failure of E - cadherin down - regulation underscores the importance of Wnt / noggin signaling in regulating this event in follicle morphogenesis [ 4].	"E - cadherin	29	41	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"noggin	96	102	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""E - cadherin"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""noggin"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Conditional gene targeting studies will be necessary to establish whether Snail family members also contribute to the down - regulation in E - cadherin gene expression that occurs during follicle formation.	"Snail	74	79	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"E - cadherin	139	151	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""E - cadherin"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Our Tg studies suggested that, at least in part through its regulation of E - cadherin, Snail is able to influence the subcellular localization of a variety of AJ - associated proteins.	"E - cadherin	74	86	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Snail	88	93	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""E - cadherin"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Snail"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
One of these appears to be Ajuba, which was previously shown to have the dual capacity to bind Grb - 2 as well as alpha - catenin [ 9, 10].

While our in vivo studies are consistent with a role for Snail in motility and epithelial remodeling, they differ with respect to Snail ' s apparent proliferative effects.

Based on the results of these studies, an EST regimen was performed in which PGC - 1 alpha + / + control animals were exercised for a duration of 60 s to match the predicted average for the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice ( ages 6 - 8 mo).

To directly assess cardiac function, the hearts of PGC - 1 alpha - / - and PGC - 1 alpha + / + mice were isolated and perfused in the working mode.

Taken together, these results indicate that, despite excess body fat under standard conditions, the female PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice do not exhibit insulin resistance.

Moreover, the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice are more glucose - tolerant and insulin - sensitive than WT mice on a high - fat diet.

Patchy areas of microvacuolation involving the neuropil and individual pyramidal neurons of the deep layers of the cerebral cortex were noted in the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice but not the PGC - 1 alpha + / + mice ( Figure 10A).

Immunolocalization of an astrocytic marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein, failed to show an increase in numbers of astrocytic processes in PGC - 1 alpha - / - mouse cerebral cortex ( unpublished data).

Microvacuolation of the neuropil and neurons of the PGC - 1 alpha - / - basal ganglia ( caudate and putamen) was also noted in association with a patchy increase in the number and intensity of glial fibrillary acidic protein - immunoreactive astrocytic processes ( unpublished data).

Indeed, we found that exposure of the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice to cold, another relevant physiologic stress, resulted in an untoward drop in core body temperature consistent with an abnormality in thermogenesis despite normal cold induction of UCP - 1 mRNA in BAT.

Studies with a beta 3 - adrenergic agonist confirmed that the peak oxygen consumption rate in thermogenic tissue is diminished in PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice.

Surprisingly, the reduction in fatty acid oxidation rates in PGC - 1 alpha null hepatocytes was not due to altered expression of PGC - 1 alpha / PPAR target genes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation.

Consistent with the former possibility, recent evidence indicates that PGC - 1 alpha coactivates the nuclear receptor FXR, a negative regulator of SREBP - 1c expression and triglyceride synthesis [ 33].

We did not find evidence for glucose intolerance or insulin resistance in the PGC - 1 alpha - / - animals on standard chow.

Alternatively, PGC - 1 alpha could serve as a coactivator of factors that mediate diet - induced insulin resistance.

Although overt neurologic dysfunction was not apparent in PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice during the first 6 mo of life ( no group differences were found on five of six sensorimotor tests), the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice showed clear deficits on the inverted screen test.	"PGC - 1 alpha	58	71	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"PGC - 1 alpha	187	200	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 187, ""end_span"": 200, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Third, we found evidence for an age - related increase in body fat in PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice ( females earlier than males), whereas Lin et al. identified a male - specific resistance to diet - induced obesity and insulin resistance.	"PGC - 1 alpha	70	83	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"insulin	215	222	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""PGC - 1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""insulin"", ""start_span"": 215, ""end_span"": 222, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, we observed that the insulin - sensitive phenotype of the female PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice occurred in the context of normal weight gain with high - fat diet.

These latter results indicate that the insulin - sensitive phenotype of PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice cannot be fully explained by a lean phenotype.

However, the bulk of data presented here support the conclusion that the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice described are completely deficient in PGC - 1 alpha.

Indeed, although PGC - 1 alpha null mice survive in the protected environment of the laboratory, our results indicate that in the rigors of a typical external environment, PGC - 1 alpha would be necessary for survival.

To address the consequences of precocious ETS signaling for proprioceptive afferent differentiation, we next expressed EWS - Pea3 in DRG neurons as soon as they became post - mitotic.

Embryos positive for either Isl1Cre / + and TauEWS - Pea3 / + or Isl1Cre / + and TaumGFP / + alleles showed efficient activation of the silent Tau allele in 95% or more of all DRG neurons, including proprioceptive afferents, at all segmental levels ( Figure S3).

We next examined the establishment of peripheral projections upon precocious EWS - Pea3 expression in DRG neurons.

In addition, there was a significant reduction in the number of muscle spindles in TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos ( approximately 25% of wild - type complement; n = 3) as assessed by innervation and expression of genes specific for intrafusal muscle fibers such as Egr3 ( Figure 3E, 3F, 3K, and 3L; [ 26]).

In summary, whereas isochronic expression of EWS - Pea3 promoted the establishment of proprioceptive afferent projections into the ventral spinal cord, precocious expression of the same ETS signaling factor in DRG neurons interfered with establishment of projections into the spinal cord as well as to peripheral targets.	"EWS	45	48	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Pea3	51	55	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""EWS"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Pea3"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
To begin to address the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the distinct biological actions of EWS - Pea3 at different developmental stages, we first turned to in vitro culture experiments.

Addition of NGF, which supports survival of cutaneous afferents, resulted in straight and unbranched neurite outgrowth ( Figure 4B), while cultures grown in the presence of NT - 3, which supports survival of proprioceptive afferents, resulted in a highly branched neurite outgrowth pattern after 48 h in vitro ( Figure 4C).

Neither the pattern of neurite outgrowth nor neuronal survival changed significantly after application of either NGF or NT - 3 ( Figure 4E and 4F).

The expression of GFP in TaumGFP / + PVCre / + was restricted to PV + proprioceptive DRG neurons and mirrored the onset of expression of PV at approximately E14 ( Figure S4; data not shown).	"PV	37	39	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"PV	65	67	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""PV"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""PV"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We next cultured E14. 5 whole DRG explants from TauEWS - Pea3 / + PVCre / + and TaumGFP / + PVCre / + mice for 48 h in vitro in the presence or absence of NT - 3 ( Figure 5).	"Pea3	57	61	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"NT - 3	155	161	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Pea3"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""NT - 3"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We found that DRG neurons from both genotypes survived and extended neurites only in the presence of NT - 3, whereas they died in the absence of NT - 3 ( Figure 5).

To determine whether neuronal survival of DRG neurons from TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos in the absence of neurotrophic support is sufficient to explain the observed neuronal outgrowth, we analyzed DRG isolated from mice mutant in the proapoptotic gene Bax [ 27].	"Pea3	68	72	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Bax	261	264	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Pea3"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Bax"", ""start_span"": 261, ""end_span"": 264, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This absence of Trk receptor expression in DRG of TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos provides a likely explanation for the lack of responsiveness of these neurons to the addition of neurotrophic factors.	"Trk receptor	16	28	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Pea3	59	63	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Trk receptor"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Pea3"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We next assayed whether the complete absence of Trk receptor expression in TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos had an influence on naturally occurring cell death in vivo using TUNEL on DRG sections.	"Trk receptor	48	60	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Pea3	84	88	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Trk receptor"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Pea3"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Together with the in vitro culture experiments, these findings suggest that DRG neurons from TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos remain post - mitotic but fail to become sensitive to naturally occurring cell death, and survive in the absence of Trk receptors and neurotrophic support.	"Pea3	102	106	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Trk receptors	247	260	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Pea3"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Trk receptors"", ""start_span"": 247, ""end_span"": 260, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Moreover, the level of the proapoptotic Bcl2 family member Bax was not significantly reduced ( Figure 6O and 6P).

We first analyzed expression of TrkC, a gene downregulated in DRG neurons of TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos ( Figure 7A and 7B).	"TrkC	32	36	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Pea3	86	90	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""TrkC"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Pea3"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Due to a transient and rostro - caudally graded expression of Hb9 at neural plate stages, very few DRG neurons at brachial levels and increasingly more neurons progressing caudally undergo recombination in TauEWS - Pea3 / + Hb9Cre / + and TaumGFP / + Hb9Cre / + embryos ( Figure 8).

Nevertheless, downregulation of Trk receptor expression or upregulation of Calretinin is restricted exclusively to neurons that have undergone recombination and cannot be observed in TaumGFP / + Hb9Cre / + embryos ( Figure 8).

Together, these results and the findings obtained from in vitro culture experiments ( see Figures 4 and 5) demonstrate that precocious or isochronic expression of EWS - Pea3 in the same neurons leads to significantly different cell - autonomous cellular responses with respect to gene expression, neuronal survival, and neurite outgrowth ( Figure 9).

Elimination of TrkA receptor signaling in Bax mutant mice perturbs establishment of peripheral projections of cutaneous afferents, whereas establishment of central projections does not appear to be affected [ 8].

Induction of Er81 expression in proprioceptive afferents is controlled by peripheral NT - 3 as axons reach the vicinity of target muscles, and thus occurs only approximately 3 d after proprioceptive neurons become post - mitotic [ 9, 14].

Because a pro - protein domain is always removed in the mature functional ADAM - proteins by the Furin - like proteases and is thought to be non - functional itself, we considered that this truncated form of ADAM22 protein has no function.

The C57Bl / 6J - hg / hg ( HG) mouse is a model of systemic overgrowth resulting from a spontaneous deletion on MMU10, which eliminates expression of the Socs2 ( suppressor of cytokine signaling 2) gene [ 14 - 16].

The effects appeared to be the result of two linked QTL, Carfhg2 at 10 cM and Feml2 at 20 cM, instead of one pleiotropically impacting both traits ( Table 1).

The HG phenotype is due to the deletion of Socs2, therefore we reasoned that QTL on MMU2, 9, 11 and 17 interacting with hg possibly represent variation within genes participating in various aspects of Gh function.

Additionally, functional variation in Stat5b may explain the sex - specific phenotypes in HG11 mice since it is the primary transcription factor responsible for Gh induced sex - specific liver gene expression [ 44].

Disruption of Sox9 expression in the XY gonad causes male - to - female sex reversal [ 21, 22], whereas increasing the dose of Sox9 in the XX gonad leads to testis development [ 23 - 25].

Therefore, Fgf9 signaling must act in parallel and / or downstream of Sry to regulate testis development.

In our previous study we did not observe SOX9 expression at 12. 5 dpc in Fgf9 - / - XY gonads that fail to develop into normal testes [ 26].

Normally, Sox9 is weakly expressed in wild - type genital ridges of both XX and XY embryos at 10. 5 dpc and, after the onset of Sry expression, is up - regulated in XY gonads [ 5, 33, 16].	"Sox9	10	14	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Sry	128	131	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Sox9"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Sry"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Primary cell culture and gonad culture systems were used to assess Sox9 activation by exogenous FGF9.

After culture for 24 h, SOX9 expression was monitored by an antibody specific to SOX9 in XX cells and control XY cells.

Up - regulation of SOX9 had not previously been seen in whole XX gonads cultured with exogenous FGF9 [ 9].

To explain the difference between experimental results from dissociated XX gonadal cells and XX gonads, we reasoned that the local concentrations of FGF9 might not be high enough to override blocking signals in the intact XX gonad, or that active FGF9 was not efficiently localized or presented in the extracellular matrix of the XX gonad.	"FGF9	149	153	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"FGF9	247	251	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""FGF9"", ""start_span"": 149, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""FGF9"", ""start_span"": 247, ""end_span"": 251, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Under these conditions, SOX9 expression was up - regulated locally in cells near the surface of the XX gonad in contact with the FGF9 bead ( Figure 2K).

Notably, in Fgf9 - / - XY gonads, SOX9 was no longer detectable by 12. 5 dpc, and Sertoli precursor cells never began to organize into normal testis cord structures ( Figure 3F).	"Fgf9	12	16	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"SOX9	34	38	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Fgf9"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""SOX9"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

[ 22] successfully cultured 11. 5 dpc Sox9 null mutant gonads in vitro and detected male and female markers after 2 - 3 d of culture, suggesting that Sox9 mutant gonads are viable and developmentally competent at 11. 5 dpc -- the time point at which we collected samples to perform mRNA in situ hybridization ( Figure 3G - 3J).	"Sox9	38	42	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Sox9	150	154	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Sox9"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Sox9"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This result supports the idea that there is a mutual interdependence between Sox9 and Fgf9 generating a positive feed - forward loop, and that both genes are required for the expansion of somatic cells, including Sertoli cell precursors, in XY gonads.	"Sox9	77	81	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Fgf9	86	90	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Sox9"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Fgf9"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Based on the fact that Sox9 is initially expressed in Fgf9 - / - gonads, we investigated whether other genes in the male pathway are activated.

Dhh, which is expressed in XY wild - type and heterozygous gonads beginning at 11. 5 dpc, was absent from Fgf9 - / - XY gonads, although mesonephric expression was still detected ( Figure 4A and 4B).	"Dhh	0	3	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Fgf9	106	110	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Dhh"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Fgf9"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, SOX9 expression in XY Fgf9 - / - gonads rapidly disappeared ( Figure 3E and 3F), and other Sertoli markers were absent or severely reduced ( Figure 4A - 4F).	"SOX9	9	13	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Fgf9	31	35	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""SOX9"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Fgf9"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
To determine whether the aborting of the male pathway in Fgf9 - / - Sertoli precursors was associated with the transition of supporting cells from male to female differentiation, we investigated expression of Wnt4, an ovary - promoting gene.	"Fgf9	57	61	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Wnt4	209	213	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Fgf9"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Wnt4"", ""start_span"": 209, ""end_span"": 213, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This result suggests that Fgf9 is necessary for the down - regulation of Wnt4 in differentiating XY gonads at / after bipotential stages.	"Fgf9	26	30	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Wnt4	73	77	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Fgf9"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Wnt4"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Fgf9 and Wnt4 Antagonize Each Other	"Fgf9	0	4	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Wnt4	9	13	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Fgf9"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Wnt4"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
These results demonstrate antagonism between WNT4 and FGF9 under in vitro gain - of - function conditions.

To test antagonism between these factors under loss - of - function conditions in vivo, we investigated whether Fgf9 is derepressed in the absence of Wnt4 ( Figure 6A - 6C).	"Fgf9	112	116	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Wnt4	150	154	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Fgf9"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Wnt4"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This result suggested that FGF9 is normally down - regulated by WNT4 in XX gonads.	"FGF9	27	31	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"WNT4	64	68	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""FGF9"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""WNT4"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
An antibody against SOX9 revealed that expression was initially up - regulated in Wnt4 - / - XX gonads at 11. 5 dpc ( Figure 6F and 6I), although it was rapidly down - regulated by 12. 0 dpc and absent at 12. 5 dpc ( Figure 6I and 6L).	"SOX9	20	24	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Wnt4	82	86	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""SOX9"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Wnt4"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This finding was confirmed by mRNA in situ hybridization, which also detected Sox9 transcripts in 11. 5 dpc Wnt4 - / - XX gonads ( Figure S1).	"Sox9	78	82	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Wnt4	108	112	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Sox9"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Wnt4"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The loss of Sertoli cells in XY Fgf9 - / - gonads is not due to cell death, but instead to a transition of supporting cell fate as SOX9 expression is lost.	"Fgf9	32	36	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"SOX9	131	135	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Fgf9"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""SOX9"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We suggest that in the absence of the antagonizing activity of FGF9, WNT4 signals predominate and govern somatic cell fate in the gonadal field.	"FGF9	63	67	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"WNT4	69	73	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""FGF9"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""WNT4"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
For many years it was believed that the fate of each cell in the genital disk was under the cell - autonomous control of double sex ( dsx), the key regulator of the sex determination pathway.

This occurs through the sex - specific regulation of WNT, FGF, and transforming growth factor beta signaling, which in turn regulate the growth, cell differentiation, and morphogenesis of the disk [ 41, 42].	"FGF	58	61	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"transforming growth factor beta	67	98	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""FGF"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""transforming growth factor beta"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Whether FGF9 normally acts non - cell - autonomously in vivo to recruit XY cells to the Sertoli lineage by up - regulating SOX9 is not clear.	"FGF9	8	12	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"SOX9	123	127	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""FGF9"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""SOX9"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
[ 47] showed that misexpression of Fgf9 in chick nephrogenous mesenchyme led to the expansion of gonadal marker gene expression, implicating Fgf9 in gonadal cell proliferation across species.	"Fgf9	35	39	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Fgf9	141	145	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Fgf9"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Fgf9"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
It has been suggested that SOX9 represses WNT4 based on misexpression studies [ 48].	"SOX9	27	31	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"WNT4	42	46	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""SOX9"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""WNT4"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Here we show that the addition of FGF9 protein to XX gonad explant cultures repressed the expression of Wnt4.	"FGF9	34	38	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Wnt4	104	108	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""FGF9"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Wnt4"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
These findings support the idea that FGF9 acts as the antagonist of Wnt4.	"FGF9	37	41	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Wnt4	68	72	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""FGF9"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Wnt4"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Antagonism of WNT signals may be a multistep process involving both the transcriptional down - regulation of Wnt4 observed in this study and the destabilization of downstream Wnt intracellular pathways that antagonize SOX9 expression, as shown in chondrocyte differentiation [ 49], or that compete for intracellular signal transducers as has been reported in other systems [ 50, 51].	"Wnt4	109	113	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"SOX9	218	222	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Wnt4"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""SOX9"", ""start_span"": 218, ""end_span"": 222, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, up - regulation of Sox9 is not sufficient to establish testis development in this mutant, as occurs in Odsex and other gain - of - function mutants where Sox9 is misexpressed in the XX gonad [ 24, 25].

In Wnt4 mutants, SOX9 expression is not maintained.

These findings suggest that WNT4 signaling normally acts as a repressor of the male pathway by interfering with the up - regulation of SOX9 expression.	"WNT4	28	32	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"SOX9	135	139	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""WNT4"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""SOX9"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Based on our findings we propose that cells in the mammalian gonad are balanced between two competing cell fates by counterbalanced signaling pathways, Fgf9, expressed near the coelomic surface, and Wnt4, expressed near the mesonephric border ( Figure 7).	"Fgf9	152	156	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Wnt4	199	203	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Fgf9"", ""start_span"": 152, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Wnt4"", ""start_span"": 199, ""end_span"": 203, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In mammalian XY gonads, the onset of Sry expression initiates the male pathway by up - regulating Sox9.

This results in the down - regulation of Sox9 and Fgf9, tilting the balance toward commitment to the female pathway.

For FGF9 immunostaining, gonads were prepared as frozen sections, and rabbit anti - mouse FGF9 ( Cell Science; 1: 50) and anti - rabbit IgG conjugated with peroxidase secondary antibody were used, followed by amplification with tyramide - Cy3 fluorophore ( Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon, United States).

In recent years, tremendous insight has been gained on p53 regulation by targeting mutations at the p53 locus using homologous recombination in ES cells to generate mutant mice.	"p53	55	58	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"p53	100	103	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""p53"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""p53"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Studies in cultured cells, often relying on the transfection of plasmids expressing various p53 mutants, have established models to explain how p53 is regulated.	"p53	92	95	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"p53	144	147	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""p53"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""p53"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 147, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
As significant differences between phenotypes from targeted p53 mutants in vivo and transfection data were observed [ e. g. Refs ( 1 - 5)], more targeted mutations need to be generated and analyzed in multiple tissues to formulate more accurate models of p53 regulation.	"p53	60	63	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"p53	255	258	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""p53"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""p53"", ""start_span"": 255, ""end_span"": 258, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Next, a PmlI - MfeI 6. 3 kb fragment from Trp53 was subcloned in a modified pBluescript KSII + ( pBS, Stratagene), and the resulting plasmid was digested with SwaI to introduce an EagI site, leading to p53PmlEag, a plasmid containing exons 2 - 11 of p53.

To make a p53 - GFP fusion protein, we first subcloned a SacII - HindIII fragment of the p53 locus ( corresponding to part of exon 10 to sequences downstream of the gene) into pBS, then mutated the HindIII site into a FseI site.	"p53	10	13	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"p53	89	92	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""p53"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""p53"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We next tested the efficiency of RMCE in ES cells, using a replacement construct encoding p53 fused to GFP ( p53GFP) to enable tracking p53 in individual live cells.

p53 + / GFP ES clones were analyzed by western blot with an antibody against p53, and found to express an additional band at the expected size ( ca. 80 kDa).	"p53	0	3	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"p53	77	80	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""p53"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""p53"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This, together with the observation that p53 levels decrease during mouse embryogenesis ( 19), suggested an explanation for the observed lack of pregnancies: we speculate that the high levels of p53GFP in the ES cells injected into blastocysts might have prevented normal embryonic development once these cells began to differentiate and the p53 pathway became functional.	"p53	41	44	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"p53	195	198	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""p53"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""p53"", ""start_span"": 195, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
To test this possibility, we performed RMCE with a p53 fusion gene in which the p53 proline - rich domain ( PRD) was deleted ( p53 Delta P), and the p53 Delta P was fused to GFP.	"p53	51	54	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"p53	80	83	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""p53"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""p53"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We first verified that the RMCE - ready p53 locus ( p53RMCE) could be transmitted through the germline by mating p53RMCE / + chimeras with p53 + / - mice ( 20) ( Figure 4).	"p53	40	43	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"p53	52	55	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""p53"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""p53"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The results confirm that deleting the proline rich domain leads to less active p53 with impaired cell cycle control, and also indicate that a GFP C - terminal fusion can dramatically alter p53 regulation.

In addition, RMCE - ASAP could be used to generate fibroblastic cell lines tailored for the repeated targeting of widely studied genes ( p53, c - myc, NF - KB, etc.).

The Ran - binding protein 2 ( RanBP2) is a large multimodular and pleiotropic protein.

Yet, the significance of these interactions with RanBP2 and the genetic and physiological role ( s) of RanBP2 in a whole - animal model remain elusive.

Hence, RanBP2 and its partners emerge as critical modulators of neuronal HKI, glucose catabolism, energy homeostasis, and targets for metabolic, aging disorders and allied neuropathies.

Still, the genetic and physiological implications of the interactions between RanBP2 and its partners and of the function of RanBP2 in a whole - animal model remain elusive.

Moreover, partial loss - of - function of RanBP2 in a mouse model induces deficits in growth rates and breakdown of glucose, promotes the down - regulation of HKI and ATP levels selectively in the central nervous system, and impairs visual function.

Several roles of RanBP2 have emerged that implicate RanBP2 in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking [ 3, 5], protein biogenesis [ 6, 7], the formation of the mitotic spindle, assembly of the nuclear envelope [ 8], and the integration of the nuclear envelope breakdown with kinetochore formation and maturation during early mitotic progression [ 9].

The specific interaction of RanBP2 with a diverse set of partners likely reflects a pleiotropic role of RanBP2 in cell function, possibly through the integration of multiple pathways.

On the other hand, the cell ( tissue) - selective interaction of RanBP2 with some of its partners may also impart cell - restricted roles to RanBP2.

A diverse set of additional molecular partners, each associating specifically with a selective domain of RanBP2, are likely to impart and integrate additional roles to RanBP2.

Finally, RanBP2 was also found to localize prominently to the mitochondria - rich ellipsoid subcellular compartment of photosensory neurons [ 19] and to RanGTPase - restricted foci along cytoplasmic tracks [ 19], in addition to its localization at cytoplasmic fibrils emanating from nuclear pores [ 2, 3, 10, 12, 19].

This promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of RanBP2 [ 20], possibly via the interaction of the CLD domain of RanBP2 with the 19S cap subunits of the proteasome [ 14].

This is reflected by a reduction of the Vmax of HKI without significantly affecting the Km of the active site of HKI toward glucose ( Figure 2A and 2B).

Regardless, lower levels of HKI likely contribute to the decreased levels in ATP, slower growth rates, and diminished ability to metabolize glucose of RanBP2 + / - mice ( Figures 5 - 7).

This is further evidenced by the presence of genetic modifiers in RanBP2 + / - mice on a mixed genetic background that compensates for deficits in RanBP2 and deregulation of its partners in glucose / energy homeostasis as observed in the coisogenic line.	"RanBP2	66	72	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"RanBP2	147	153	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""RanBP2"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""RanBP2"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

Hence, RanBP2 and its partners emerge as key players and target genes in mediating neuropathophysiological mechanisms implicated in various genetic and environmental lesions to the CNS, as in patients with Parkinson, diabetes with insulin - resistance, and other neuropathies and neurodegenerative diseases, often linked to aging manifestations.

In contrast, in Alk5 / Wnt1 - Cre mutants the outflow tract appeared unusually straight, failing to demonstrate the distinct conotruncal transition ( Fig. 5B, D).

In Alk5 / Wnt1 - Cre mutants the characteristic rotation of the aortic sac and truncal OFT fails to take place ( Fig. 6G - L), and a properly formed AP - septum was not detectable ( Fig. 6G, H).

To conclude, while both Alk2 and Alk5 mutants demonstrate a failure in both the rotation of the aortic sac and the truncal OFT, and in the formation of the AP septum, the pathogenetic mechanisms behind these defects appear remarkably different.

As described above, Alk5 / Wnt1 - Cre mutants displayed an inadequate amount of AP - septal tissue in the base of the aortic sac between the origins of 4th and 6th PAAs.

Thus, we compared apoptosis patterns also on the more proximal level, but found no detectable differences at E11. 0 between Alk5 / Wnt1 - Cre mutants and controls ( Fig. 7D, E).

To conclude, our results suggest that in Alk5 / Wnt1 - Cre mutants a noticeable increase in apoptosis coincides with the abnormal patterning of the PAAs and the aortic sac, and with the failed AP - septation.

In addition to the cardiac OFT, development of pharyngeal organs, i. e., the parathyroid glands and the thymus was also abnormal in Alk5 / Wnt1 - Cre mutants ( see Figs. 1 and 8).

Our immunohistochemical staining of alpha SMA in the OFT unequivocally demonstrated that signaling via ALK5 is not required for smooth muscle differentiation in vivo.

Firstly, while the pharyngeal organ migration fails in Alk5 / Wnt1 - Cre mutants, perhaps as a result of increased mesenchymal cell death in the pharyngeal region, both the thymus, thyroid and parathyroid seem to develop relatively normally on the histological level in these mutants.

Since we could not detect appropriate rotation of the OFT in neural crest - specific mutants of Alk5 or Alk2, it appears that cells derived from the NC, as well as those from the SHF, are mutually required for proper OFT rotation in mice.

In contrast, in Alk2 / Wnt1 - Cre mutants a sizeable septal mesenchyme could be seen, still without any obvious looping of the aortic sac and truncal OFT, suggesting that the mere presence of the septal mesenchyme, without correct smooth muscle cell differentiation, is not sufficient for OFT rotation.

In this study, we have deleted the TGF - beta type I receptor ( Alk5) gene specifically in the mouse neural crest ( NC) cell lineage.

For immunohistochemistry, fixed sections from tissues harvested at E10. 5 - E11. 5 were stained with monoclonal alpha - smooth muscle actin ( DAKO), cleaved caspase - 3 ( Cell Signaling) or phophohistone - H3 ( Cell Signaling) antibodies.

In contrast, we find that the loss of both BMP2 and BMP4 results in a severe impairment of osteogenesis.

A group of related signaling molecules called bone morphogenetic proteins ( BMPs) are known to play important roles in the formation of the structures such as the limbs.

Differences in anterior - posterior pattern are instructed as a graded response to Sonic Hedghog ( SHH) signaling emanating from the posterior margin of the limb bud [ 5].

Both are expressed in a broader domain than SHH in the early posterior limb bud mesenchyme [ 6, 7], although BMP7 also has a second, weaker domain of expression in the anterior limb bud mesenchyme.	"SHH	44	47	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP7	109	113	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""SHH"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP7"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Moreover, BMP signaling has a weak ability to posteriorly polarize the limb in ectopic grafting experiments [ 10], an activity enhanced by prior low - level exposure to SHH [ 11].	"BMP	10	13	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"SHH	169	172	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""SHH"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 172, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
A targeted deletion of Bmp7 has been made, and Bmp7 - deficient embryos display hindlimb polydactyly with incomplete penetrance but otherwise phenotypically normal limbs [ 12, 13].	"Bmp7	23	27	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Bmp7	47	51	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Bmp7"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Bmp7"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, BMP4 is not a candidate for a secondary signal downstream of SHH in early patterning.	"BMP4	6	10	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"SHH	67	70	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""SHH"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
As a consequence of the initial establishment of anterior - posterior positioned information within the limb by SHH and / or BMP signaling, the interdigital mesenchyme of the hand plate becomes specified in a graded manner.	"SHH	112	115	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP	125	128	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""SHH"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
For example, ectopic application of BMP antagonists demonstrates that BMP signaling is necessary for this process, and in its absence, webbing occurs [ 17 - 19]).	"BMP	36	39	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP	70	73	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
BMP activity also plays an indirect role in limb patterning as a key component of a feedback loop between SHH production in the posterior limb bud and fibroblast growth factor production in the overlying apical ectodermal ridge ( AER).	"BMP	0	3	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"SHH	106	109	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""SHH"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
SHH activity leads to the upregulation of the BMP antagonist Gremlin in the mesenchyme [ 20, 21].	"SHH	0	3	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP	46	49	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""SHH"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, conditional removal of BMP4 activity from the posterior limb mesenchyme results in a persistence of the AER, expanded SHH signaling, and consequent preaxial and postaxial polydactyly [ 16].	"BMP4	29	33	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"SHH	124	127	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""SHH"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Likewise, conditional knockout of BmpR1A and BmpR1B blocks all chondrogenic differentiation in the mouse limb bud [ 26].	"BmpR1A	34	40	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BmpR1B	45	51	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BmpR1A"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BmpR1B"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Similarly, when noggin, a potent BMP inhibitor, is introduced in early stage chick limb buds prior to skeletogenesis, mesenchymal condensation does not take place [ 27, 28].	"noggin	16	22	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP	33	36	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""noggin"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Conversely, removal of individual ligands such as BMP4 [ 16] or BMP7 [ 12, 13] has not displayed defects in skeletal differentiation, presumably due to functional redundancy.	"BMP4	50	54	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP7	64	68	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP7"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Since Bmp2 and Bmp4 mutants are both lethal early in embryogenesis [ 30, 31], we used conditional alleles of both these genes.	"Bmp2	6	10	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Bmp4	15	19	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Bmp2"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Bmp4"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The Bmp2 / Bmp4 double mutants did display a loss of posterior digits with a broad posterior hand plate, suggestive of a block in the chondrogenic condensation of the posterior digit rays, rather than a change in anterior - posterior digit identity.	"Bmp2	4	8	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Bmp4	11	15	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Bmp2"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Bmp4"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, at later stages, the combined loss of BMP2 and BMP4 evidently becomes limiting, and osteogenesis ceases.	"BMP2	47	51	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	56	60	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
As all prior reported manipulations of the BMP pathway during skeletal development either result in a block at the first stage of chondrogenesis or allow complete skeletal formation, this is the first demonstration of a requirement for BMP activity in osteogenic differentiation.	"BMP	43	46	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP	236	239	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 236, ""end_span"": 239, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, BMP2 and BMP4 are both required for viability early in embryonic development [ 30, 31].	"BMP2	9	13	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	18	22	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
By the time its expression is first detectable, the floxed Bmp2 allele appears to be completely recombined in the limb mesenchyme, as whole mount in situ hybridization does not detect any mesenchymal Bmp2 transcription ( Figure 1B).	"Bmp2	59	63	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Bmp2	200	204	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Bmp2"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Bmp2"", ""start_span"": 200, ""end_span"": 204, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Mice with limbs deficient in BMP4 activity and the limbs of Bmp7 mutant mice have both been previously described.

The first of these is in establishing differences along the anterior - posterior axis of the limb downstream of sonic hedgehog ( Shh).	"sonic hedgehog	112	126	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Shh	129	132	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""sonic hedgehog"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Shh"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
While a distal phalanx is missing in the middle digits of the double mutants ( Bmp2C / C, Bmp7 - / -; Prx1:: cre), this is not a phenotype consistent with a decrease or loss of a posteriorly derived polarizing activity.	"Bmp7	90	94	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Prx1	102	106	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Bmp7"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Prx1"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In contrast to the proposed roles for BMPs in anterior - posterior digit patterning, we obtained further support for the well - accepted idea that a threshold level of BMP signaling is necessary interdigitally for programmed cell death to occur.	"BMPs	38	42	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP	168	171	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMPs"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 168, ""end_span"": 171, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This correlates with an anterior expansion in Shh expression ( Figure 3E and 3F, red bracket) and a concomitant expansion of the AER as visualized by Fgf8 expression ( Figure 3G and 3H, red bracket).	"Shh	46	49	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Fgf8	150	154	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Shh"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Fgf8"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The expansion in Shh expression can first be detected at E10. 5 and persists at least until E12. 5, well after the time normal Shh expression disappears at E11. 75 ( Figure 3L and 3P).	"Shh	17	20	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Shh	127	130	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Shh"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Shh"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Expression of several Fgf genes [ 20, 21] and maintenance of the AER itself [ 23] normally depend on BMP antagonism induced by SHH.	"BMP	101	104	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"SHH	127	130	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""SHH"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Because Shh expression is, reciprocally, supported by FGF signaling from the AER [ 8, 24], this, in turn, feeds back on the ZPA, expanding Shh expression.	"Shh	8	11	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Shh	139	142	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Shh"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Shh"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
While this explains the broader hand plate of the BMP2, BMP4 - deficient limb buds, it is somewhat paradoxical in terms of the skeletal phenotype, as a broadened autopod would normally be expected to result in the formation of extra digits ( polydactyly) ( e. g., Figure 1G and 1O of this paper and [ 16]), not the loss of digits, as observed in the double mutant forelimbs.	"BMP2	50	54	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	56	60	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
To examine the loss of digits more closely, BMP2, BMP4 - deficient limb buds were examined during cartilage condensation phase of the digit rays at E12. 5.

However, in Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre limb buds at E12. 5, Sox9 only detects primordia of the anterior three digits of the forelimb, indicating a failure in the formation of posterior digits at this earliest stage ( Figure 3J).

Genes such as Msx2 ( Figure 3N) continue to be expressed throughout the posterior forelimb mesenchyme, indicating that the posterior forelimb tissue is viable at E12. 5 in the Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre animals.

In contrast, however, limbs completely deficient in both BMP2 and BMP4 activity showed severe defects in skeletal differentiation.

As noted above, at E12. 5, chondrogenic condensation of the digits could be visualized in Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre limb buds by in situ hybridization with a Sox9 probe.

Similar analysis at E10. 5 and E11. 5 demonstrated a relatively normal process of condensation of the proximal skeletal elements ( Figure S1H - S1M), despite the absence of detectable Bmp2 and Bmp4 transcripts.

Histological examination of the humeri at E13. 5 showed that while chondrogenic differentiation had taken place in the BMP2, BMP4 - deficient humerus, hypertrophic differentiation was delayed ( Figure 4C and 4D).

At E13. 5, we observed no increase in expression of Bmp6 ( Figure S1P - S1S) or Bmp7 ( compare Figure 4H with Figure 4G) mRNA in the mutant tissues compared to their wild - type counterparts	"Bmp6	52	56	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Bmp7	80	84	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Bmp6"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Bmp7"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Osteogenesis Is Initiated Normally in BMP2, BMP4 - Deficient Limb Buds	"BMP2	38	42	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	44	48	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We examined whether the osteogenesis program is initiated in the BMP2, BMP4 - deficient limbs using several histological and molecular criteria, as described below ( Figure 5).	"BMP2	65	69	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	71	75	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Adjacent to the hypertrophic cells, a bone collar is laid down normally in the absence of BMP2 and BMP4 ( Figure 5A and 5B, red star).	"BMP2	90	94	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	99	103	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In contrast, in E17. 5 limbs deficient in BMP2 and BMP4, there is an overall delay in the normal endochondral process ( Figure 5F).	"BMP2	42	46	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	51	55	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In stark contrast, bone formation is not observed in the absence of BMP2 and BMP4 at 1 or 3 wks after birth ( Figure 6F - 6J).	"BMP2	68	72	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	77	81	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In the absence of BMP2 and BMP4, cells which are fibroblastic in appearance ( Figure 6H) are found adjacent to the mineralized cartilage surfaces.	"BMP2	18	22	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	27	31	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
These results allow us to conclude that the fibroblast - like cells resident in the bone shaft ( Figure 6H) may be osteoprogenitor cells unable to differentiate into mature osteoblasts in the absence of BMP2 and BMP4.	"BMP2	203	207	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	212	216	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 203, ""end_span"": 207, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 212, ""end_span"": 216, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, BMP2 and BMP4 are required in concert to promote condensation of the posterior digit anlagen.	"BMP2	9	13	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	18	22	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
On the other hand, BMP2 and BMP4 together are required for completion of osteogenesis.	"BMP2	19	23	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	28	32	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Application of the BMP antagonist noggin to the interdigital tissue at the time of digit condensation results in loss of phalanges and a resultant pattern that can be interpreted as an anterior homeotic transformation in digit identity.	"BMP	19	22	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"noggin	34	40	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""noggin"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, if levels of BMP signaling were instructive in terms of digit identities, then a substantial decrease in the amount of BMP ligand present should cause transformations in digit identity.	"BMP	22	25	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP	128	131	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
It is worth noting that the defects in chondrogenesis seen in the BMP2, BMP4 - deficient limbs are much more severe proximally than distally.	"BMP2	66	70	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	72	76	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Their mice, therefore, lost a half - dose of BMP4 from the AER in addition to complete loss in the mesenchyme, while our conditional alleles were only recombined in the mesenchyme by the Prx1:: cre driver.	"BMP4	45	49	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Prx1	187	191	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Prx1"", ""start_span"": 187, ""end_span"": 191, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, loss of both BMP2 and BMP4 results in complete soft tissue syndactyly, i. e., webbing between all the digits.	"BMP2	22	26	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	31	35	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The phenotype we observe in limbs of Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre mice is similar to the phenotype reported for osterix knockout mice [ 46], which exhibited severe defects in osteoblastic differentiation.	"Prx1	59	63	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"osterix	116	123	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Prx1"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""osterix"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This suggests that varying levels of expression from different BMP genes during preaxial and postaxial development result in fluctuations in total levels of BMP signaling, which at distinct times are above or below the threshold for supporting osteogenesis.	"BMP	63	66	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP	157	160	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 160, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that BMP2 and BMP4 have distinct functions in osteoblastogenesis.	"BMP2	49	53	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	58	62	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Our analysis of skeletogenesis indicates that BMP2 and BMP4 are prerequisite for osteoblastogenesis while less important for chondrogenesis.	"BMP2	46	50	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"BMP4	55	59	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""BMP2"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""BMP4"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
These studies provide the first evidence linking BMP2 and BMP4 with bone formation in an in vivo setting where the preceding events of chondrogenesis are not compromised.

At E13. 5, the Pygo2 gene appeared to play a major role, and the Pygo1 gene a minor role, in canonical Wnt signaling in the ureteric tree, as measured by BAT - gal expression.

One possible explanation of these unexpected results is a failure of the gene targeting to eliminate functioning of the Pygo1 and Pygo2 genes.

In the fetal ovary, Dmrt7 mRNA was detected primarily from E13. 5 to E15. 5, the time during which meiosis progresses from pre - meiotic replication to the pachytene stage [ 4], whereas Dmrt7 expression in the non - meiotic fetal testis was very low.

Because this earlier work did not examine adult Dmrt7 expression, we first performed reverse transcriptase ( RT) - PCR on mRNA from ten adult organs and detected strong Dmrt7 mRNA expression in the testis and a trace of expression in heart, but not in any other tissue tested ( Figure 1A).

cDNA from each organ was amplified with primers specific for Dmrt7 ( top row) and beta - actin ( bottom row).

Testis sections from 6 - wk - old male stained with antibodies to DMRT7 ( red) and SUMO - 1 ( green).

Immunofluorescent staining with purified DMRT7 antisera showed that DMRT7 protein is expressed predominantly in mid - to late - pachytene spermatocytes ( Figure 1C), as well as in sperm, and is not detectable in other germ cell types including spermatogonia and round spermatids.

To more precisely determine the pachytene stages of DMRT7 expression, we double - stained with an antibody to GATA1, which is expressed in Sertoli cells from stages VII to IX [ 38].

To establish the functional requirement for Dmrt7, we generated Dmrt7 - / - mice by targeted disruption in embryonic stem ( ES) cells using a strategy diagrammed in Figure S2A.

Targeted animals were bred to beta - actin Cre mice to delete the DM domain - encoding exons, generating the Dmrt7 - allele, or to Flpe transgenic mice to delete the neo cassette, generating the Dmrt7flox allele.

To assess homolog synapsis, we used antibodies to SYCP1, a synaptonemal complex transverse element component, and SYCP3, a component of the axial element, which remains on the desynapsed axes during diplonema [ 47, 48].	"SYCP1	50	55	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"SYCP3	114	119	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""SYCP1"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""SYCP3"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Formation of synaptonemal complexes in the mutant was indistinguishable from that in wild - type, as indicated by the proper accumulation of SYCP1 ( unpublished data) and SYCP3 ( Figure 5A).

Likewise, the Dmrt7 mutant zygotene spermatocytes showed normal accumulation of the early recombination repair marker RAD51, suggesting that early meiotic recombination is not significantly affected ( Figure 5B).

Dmrt7 mutant spermatocytes exhibited the expected decline in the presence of RAD51 foci associated with the autosomal synaptonemal complexes ( Figure 5B; unpublished data) [ 49].

( A) Testicular cells from Dmrt7 heterozygous ( + / -) or homozygous ( - / -) mutant mice were spread and stained with antibody to SYCP3 ( red).

Although we did not detect DMRT7 expression in Sertoli cells by antibody staining, we nevertheless considered the possibility that Sertoli cell defects might contribute to the male - specific germ line failure of Dmrt7 mutants.	"DMRT7	27	32	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Dmrt7	213	218	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""DMRT7"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Dmrt7"", ""start_span"": 213, ""end_span"": 218, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
To characterize Sertoli cell differentiation, we examined expression of the Sertoli cell markers GATA4 ( a marker of immature postnatal Sertoli cells) and GATA1 ( a mature Sertoli cell marker).	"GATA4	97	102	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"GATA1	155	160	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GATA4"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""GATA1"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 160, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, the organization of Sertoli cells in Dmrt7 mutant testes was abnormal: in some tubules GATA1 - positive Sertoli cell nuclei were displaced from their usual close apposition with the basement membrane ( Figure 6C).

( A) Testes from P14 wild - type and Dmrt7 mutant mice were sectioned and stained with antibody to GATA4.

At P14, GATA4 and GATA1 levels are similar in wild - type and mutant Sertoli cell.

( E) Testis sections from 10 - wk - old wild - type and SC - Dmrt7KO mice stained with antibodies to GATA1 ( red) and smooth muscle actin ( to outline seminiferous tubules; green).

These results suggest the germ cell defects of Dmrt7 mutants are not caused by lack of Dmrt7 in Sertoli cells.

The data presented so far indicate that Dmrt7 mutant germ cells undergo apparently normal early meiosis and then arrest during pachynema due to a strict requirement for Dmrt7 in the germ line.	"Dmrt7	40	45	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Dmrt7	169	174	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Dmrt7"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Dmrt7"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
gamma H2AX localized normally to the XY body of DMRT7 mutant cells in meiotic spreads ( Figure 7A), and many gamma H2AX - positive puncta were present in germ cells of Dmrt7 mutant testes ( Figure 7B).

Punctate SUMO - 1 localization was present in Dmrt7 mutant germ cells, again consistent with formation of a correctly marked XY body ( Figure 7C).

We also examined heterochromatin protein 1 beta ( HP1 beta), which normally localizes to the X centromere at mid - pachynema and then spreads through the XY body as it internalizes during diplonema [ 56].

We found that HP1 beta localization is normal in DMRT7 mutant cells in mid - pachynema ( Figure 8C and 8D).

Although most Dmrt7 mutant cells are eliminated by apoptosis prior to diplonema, we were able to examine epigenetic markers of PMSC in rare Dmrt7 mutant spermatocytes that escaped pachytene arrest and progressed into diplonema.

Not all Dmrt7 mutant diplotene cells showed abnormal localization of HP1 beta to the sex chromatin ( Figure 8M).

This independently identified Dmrt7 mutant diplotene cells lacking HP1 beta accumulation in the XY body, such as the example in Figure 9B.

Two other DM domain genes, Dmrt1 and Dmrt4, do affect germ cell development in the mouse.

The requirement for DMRT1 in pre - meiotic germ cells and DMRT7 in meiotic germ cells demonstrates that DM domain proteins act at multiple critical points of male germ cell development.

Strikingly, Dmrt7 is present, not only in placental mammals, but also in marsupials and a monotreme ( egg - laying mammal), the platypus, which has a clear Dmrt7 ortholog [ 36].

DMRT7 localizes to the sex chromosomes after they are assembled into specialized heterochromatin, and many Dmrt7 mutant cells have epigenetic defects in the modification of the sex chromatin between pachytene and diplotene.

Although Dmrt7 belongs to an ancient and conserved gene family, it is found only in mammals, and to our knowledge DMRT7 is the only example of a mammal - specific protein that is essential for meiosis.

PCH2, encoding a nucleolar - localized AAA - ATPase that was originally identified in an S. cerevisiae genetic screen for mutants that relieve pachytene arrest of asynaptic zip1 mutants [ 8], was recently determined to be an essential component of the pachytene synapsis ( but not DSB repair) checkpoint in yeast and worms [ 2, 12].

Pachytene spermatocyte nuclei from postpubertal mutant testes could assemble normal SC cores and exhibited full synapsis of chromosomes as judged by colabeling of SYCP1 and SYCP3 along the full lengths of all autosomes ( Figure 4A).

The cohesin complex, which is essential for completion and / or maintenance of synaptic associations, appeared to assemble normally as judged by immunolabeling for the meiosis - specific cohesins STAG3 ( Figure S2C and S2D) and REC8 ( unpublished data).

For RAD51 / DMC1, mutant pachytene spermatocytes contained 138 +/- 6 foci ( compared to 11 +/- 3 foci in wild type, most of which were on the XY body), down from 218 +/- 13 in zygonema ( compared to 220 +/- 13 foci in wild type).

BLM has been reported to colocalize with markers ( RPA and MSH4) of recombination at sites distinct from those that become resolved as crossovers ( CO) [ 24].

Consistent with the presence of rare ( < 1%) Trip13Gt / Gt pachytene spermatocytes devoid of persistent DNA repair markers, and testis histology showing some degree of postmeiotic progression ( Figure 3G), we observed both diplotene nuclei that lacked autosomal RAD51 / DMC1 and gamma H2AX ( Figure S3A - S3D), and also metaphase I spreads with 20 bivalents ( Figure S3E - S3F).	"RAD51	262	267	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"DMC1	270	274	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""RAD51"", ""start_span"": 262, ""end_span"": 267, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""DMC1"", ""start_span"": 270, ""end_span"": 274, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
To assess whether CO recombination occurs in the mutant, we examined the distribution of the mismatch repair proteins MLH1 and MLH3, which are normally detectable as foci in mid - late pachynema and mark the locations of chiasmata [ 30, 31].	"MLH1	118	122	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"MLH3	127	131	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""MLH1"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""MLH3"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Since < 1% of Trip13Gt / Gt pachytene nuclei had normal repair ( as judged by absence of persistent DSB repair markers; see above), but most of the pachytene nuclei had MLH1 / 3 foci, it was unlikely that the MLH1 / 3 foci formed only on chromosomes with fully repaired DSBs.	"MLH1	169	173	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"MLH1	209	213	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""MLH1"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""MLH1"", ""start_span"": 209, ""end_span"": 213, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
To assess whether these MLH1 / 3 foci in Trip13Gt / Gt pachytene spermatocytes represent CO events completed to a point where they could maintain interhomolog attachments though the end of prophase I, we treated testicular cells from 17. 5 - 20. 5 - d - old control ( + / +), Trip13Gt / Gt, and Dmc1 - / - mice with the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid ( OA), a chemical that induces degradation of the SC, chromosome condensation, and premature progression to metaphase I [ 33].

Whereas all of the Dmc1 - / - spreads had ~ 35 or more condensed chromosomes, all of the + / + and Trip13Gt / Gt spreads had 20 - 25, suggesting that the MLH1 / 3 foci in Trip13Gt / Gt pachytene spermatocytes represent sites of completed, or near - completed, COs.

In C. elegans, spo - 11 mutant gametes have extensive asynapsis, which triggers PCH - 2 dependent apoptosis in pachynema [ 2].

In contrast to the complete synapsis in Trip13Gt / Gt pachytene spermatocytes ( Figure 5A), in which SPO11 is available in leptonema to initiate ( via DSB induction, Figure S2A and S2B) a recombination - driven homolog search, chromosome synapsis in doubly mutant spermatocytes was highly disrupted as in Spo11 single mutants ( Figure 5B and 5C).

To test this, we performed epistasis analysis with a Rec8 allele ( Rec8Mei8, abbreviated as Rec8 -).	"Rec8	53	57	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Rec8	67	71	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Rec8"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Rec8"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Double mutant analysis indicated that Rec8 is epistatic to Trip13.	"Rec8	38	42	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Trip13	59	65	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Rec8"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Trip13"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
To investigate this relationship in mice, we constructed animals doubly mutant for Trip13 and Dmc1.	"Trip13	83	89	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Dmc1	94	98	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Trip13"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Dmc1"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
As in Dmc1 - / - mice, in which spermatocytes undergo meiotic arrest from defective DSB repair and failed chromosome synapsis [ 16], spermatogenesis in Dmc1 - / - Trip13Gt / Gt testes was uniformly arrested at the point where spermatocytes contained chromatin characteristic of zygonema / pachynema ( Figure 3N).

As expected, ovaries of Rec8 Trip13 double mutants were devoid of oocytes as were those from either single mutant ( Figure 3B, 3S, and 3T).

As in yeast, both require SPO11 - induced breaks, but only the CO pathway requires MLH1.

Additionally, it was reported that pch2 Delta yeast had a meiosis I delay dependent on the RAD17 - SAE2 checkpoint that monitors recombination intermediates [ 12].

However, the exact role of TRIP13 ( or Pch2) in recombination is unclear.	"TRIP13	27	33	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Pch2	39	43	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""TRIP13"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Pch2"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Notably, TRIP13 has two putative ATPase domains, a signature of AAA - ATPase ClpA / B chaperones that perform protein or protein / DNA complex disassembly [ 52].	"TRIP13	9	15	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"ClpA	77	81	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""TRIP13"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""ClpA"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Notably, A. thaliana does not appear to have a meiotic checkpoint activity that eliminates mutant meiocytes in a manner analogous to organisms such as mice, budding yeast, and female Drosophila [ 11, 57], and mammalian TRIP13 is more similar to Arabidopsis PCH2 than the fly or worm proteins ( Figures 1A and S1).	"TRIP13	219	225	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"Arabidopsis PCH2	245	261	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""TRIP13"", ""start_span"": 219, ""end_span"": 225, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""Arabidopsis PCH2"", ""start_span"": 245, ""end_span"": 261, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The unusual relatedness between mammalian and plant PCH2 may therefore be attributable to both the presence of a common conserved function ( namely recombination, although the role of PCH2 in plants has yet to be determined), and the absence of checkpoint function.	"PCH2	52	56	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"PCH2	184	188	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""PCH2"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""PCH2"", ""start_span"": 184, ""end_span"": 188, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Nevertheless, the evolutionary relationships between animals, fungi, and plants ( which are discordant with PCH2 sequence phylogeny) do not allow parsimonious models addressing the points in time that checkpoint functions in PCH2 were gained or lost.	"PCH2	108	112	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"PCH2	225	229	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""PCH2"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""PCH2"", ""start_span"": 225, ""end_span"": 229, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, DOT1 acts upstream of PCH2.	"DOT1	9	13	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"PCH2	31	35	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""DOT1"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}, {""token"": ""PCH2"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Given that TRIP13 doesn ' t have checkpoint function in mice, a potential role for mammalian DOT1 in the pachytene checkpoint is dubious but awaits investigation.

Recently, it was shown that the TRP53 homolog TRP63 is required for DNA damage - induced death of dictyate - stage primordial oocytes, leading to the suggestion that it is involved in monitoring genome integrity [ 59].
