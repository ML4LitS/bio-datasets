Mammalian enzymes homologous to human CLN2 [ 2, 4] form a subfamily of sedolisins with highly conserved sequences ( Figure 1).	"human CLN2	32	42	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""human CLN2"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

The full - length enzymes consist of 563 amino acids arranged in a single polypeptide chain containing both the prosegment and the catalytic domain, with the exception of mouse CLN2 that has a single deletion in the prosegment.

In addition to the mammals, CLN2 - like enzymes are also found in fugu ( puffer fish - unannotated record SINFRUP00000077297 in the NCBI fugu sequence database,) and zebrafish ( contig wz4596. 2 in the zebrafish EST database,).

The available amino acid sequence of the fugu CLN2 analog, named by us sedolisin - TPP [ 8], is also in good agreement with the sequences of the mammalian orthologs ( Figure 3).

Complete sequences are shown for CLN2 from human, fugu, and zebrafish, together with the partial sequence of putative CLN2 in Xenopus tropicalis.

However, the sequenced part of the enzyme shows 75% identity with the fugu sedolisin - TPP, and 69% identity with human CLN2 ( Figure 3).	"human CLN2	114	124	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""human CLN2"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Sequence similarity to bacterial or fungal sedolisins is much lower, indicating that the enzyme found in frogs might also share the functional properties of the CLN2 subfamily.

The discovery of highly conserved CLN2 - like enzymes not only in mammals but also in two fish species and one of frogs may indicate that these peptidases are universally present in the vertebrates, and that their important role identified in humans [ 2] and mice [ 14] might be a more general feature.

"Although it has not been directly shown that this compound can inhibit human CLN2, other similar peptides with an aldehyde functionality on their "" C - termini "" are weak, but detectable, inhibitors of this enzyme ( Oda, unpublished)."

It is thus likely that pseudo - iodotyrostatin or a similar inhibitor might work for CLN2 as well, although the actual contacts between the inhibitor and the enzyme that are seen in the model have to be treated with caution.	"CLN2	85	89	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""CLN2"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Another reason for the modeling of a pseudo - iodotyrostatin complex is that CLN2 is a tripeptidase, and that this inhibitor it represents the only experimental structure of a tripeptide analog bound to sedolisin.

The r. m. s. deviation between the corresponding C alpha coordinates of the model of CLN2 ( Figure 5) and the experimental structure of sedolisin is about 1. 75 A, not much larger than the experimental difference between sedolisin and kumamolisin.	"CLN2	85	89	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""CLN2"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
That this bond likely occurs in the real protein is suggested by the fact that these two cysteines are strictly conserved in all known animal species of CLN2 ( Figures 1 and 3), although they are absent in all known sequences of bacterial sedolisins.	"CLN2	153	157	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""CLN2"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

Since the principal known activity of CLN2 is that of a tripeptidase, it is expected that three substrate - binding pockets, S1 through S3 ( using the nomenclature of Schechter and Berger [ 16]), should be discernible.	"CLN2	38	42	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""CLN2"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The right - hand side of the pocket ( in the view used in Figure 6) is made of the main chain including residues 164 - 165 ( unless otherwise indicated, the numbering refers to the sequence of the mature human CLN2).	"human CLN2	204	214	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""human CLN2"", ""start_span"": 204, ""end_span"": 214, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

The equivalent residue in CLN2 is Thr182, but it is very unlikely that it can assume an orientation that would allow it to make a hydrogen bond to a P1 tyrosine.	"CLN2	26	30	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""CLN2"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, the residue found here in CLN2 is Cys170, much less polar than its counterparts.	"CLN2	35	39	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""CLN2"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
There is also no equivalent to the polar interaction between Glu175 and Glu171 in sedolisin, since the equivalent of the latter residue in CLN2 is Ser166, much smaller and pointing away.	"CLN2	139	143	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""CLN2"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The side of the S1 pocket that is created by the very flexible side chain of Arg179 in sedolisin contains only a much smaller Ser174 in CLN2, and thus is much more open in the latter protein.	"CLN2	136	140	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""CLN2"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In summary, the S1 pocket in CLN2 has less polar character than the equivalent pocket in the related proteins, and is lacking direct polar anchors for any side chains that might be present in the substrate.

Tyr130, an equivalent of the latter residue in CLN2, is unlikely to come into direct contact with the P2 residue of the substrate due to its greater distance ( almost 4 A for the closest atoms).	"CLN2	47	51	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""CLN2"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
An important remaining puzzle is that the predicted structure of CLN2 does not show any clear limitations of the S3 pocket that could explain the tripeptidase activity of this enzyme.	"CLN2	65	69	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""CLN2"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The only negatively charged residue of CLN2 that is found in this vicinity is Asp132.	"CLN2	39	43	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""CLN2"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, this latter interaction is not likely to be structurally crucial since the serine is not absolutely conserved in all CLN2 - like enzymes.	"CLN2	126	130	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""CLN2"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Only the role of the latter mutation is completely clear, since it replaces the catalytic serine of CLN2 with a side chain that cannot support its enzymatic activity.	"CLN2	100	104	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""CLN2"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Residues Val190, Gly194, and Arg252 are very highly conserved not only in CLN2 but also in other sedolisins and must play an important structural role.	"CLN2	74	78	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""CLN2"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The reasons why the remaining mutations would lead to the loss of enzymatic activity are much less clear, but the wide distribution of these mutations in the structure supports the conclusion that any modifications to CLN2 that would abolish or impair its function could lead to the development of the disease.

It has been shown recently that CLN2 can indeed degrade this subunit on its N terminus [ 18], but the unambiguous proof that this is indeed the most important target is still lacking.

The observation that an analogous peptide acetylated on its N terminus cannot be processed supports the postulate that the interactions of the N - terminal amino group with the side chain of Asp132 may be the most important feature defining the tripeptidase specificity of CLN2.

Since the catalytic machinery of CLN2 matches closely that of sedolisin, kumamolisin, and other members of the family of serine - carboxyl peptidases, the enzymatic mechanism of all these enzymes is most likely the same.

Design of inhibitors specific for CLN2 should incorporate the features that have been proven to be important for the related enzymes, such as the placement of an aldehyde functionality capable of making covalent interactions with the catalytic serine, or the utilization of chloromethyl ketone for the same purpose.

Analysis of the model of CLN2 suggests that the size of the S1 subsite is much larger than in either sedolisin or kumamolisin, and thus the use of a large P1 group might be indicated.

Apcs - / - mice compared with the strain - matched controls.	"Apcs	193	197	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Apcs"", ""start_span"": 193, ""end_span"": 197, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In view of the possibility of an association between the fixed 129 - derived segment flanking the mutated Apcs gene and the autoimmune traits observed, the genome - wide linkage analysis of the two experimental cohorts was carried out separately.	"Apcs	106	110	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Apcs"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Only linkages identified in both experimental groups are reported in Table 3, with the exception of the Chromosome 1 distal segment, where the linkage analysis could not be applied to the ( 129 x C57BL / 6) F2. Apcs - / - mice as this region was of fixed 129 origin.	"Apcs	211	215	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Apcs"", ""start_span"": 211, ""end_span"": 215, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Interestingly, whilst ANA and anti - chromatin Ab levels showed suggestive or significant linkages only to the telomeric region of Chromosome 1, with an estimated peak occurring at a position approximately 90 cM near the Apcs gene, anti - dsDNA or anti - ssDNA Ab production was also linked to other segments on Chromosome 1, indicating a more complex genetic contribution from the 129 mouse strain.	"Apcs	221	225	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Apcs"", ""start_span"": 221, ""end_span"": 225, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We compared the levels of these auto - Abs between all ( 129 x C57BL / 6) F2. Apcs - / - mice and a group of 33 wild - type mice that were selected for being homozygous 129 in the region of Chromosome 1 between microsatellites D1Mit105 and D1Mit 223 ( 80 - 106 cM) ( Figure 6A - 6D).	"Apcs	78	82	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Apcs"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This result demonstrates that, most likely, the 129 - derived region and not the lack of Apcs was mediating the production of ANA and anti - chromatin Ab.	"Apcs	89	93	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Apcs"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Consistent with this explanation, we found that the 129 mice have significantly higher levels of Apcs in circulation compared with the C57BL / 6 mice ( median, 83 mg / l; range, 25 - 208; n = 16 versus median, 5 mg / l; range, 4 - 9; n = 10, respectively; p < 0. 0001).

The C57BL / 6 strain has previously been reported to be one of the murine strains defined as low Apcs producers ( Pepys et al. 1979; Baltz et al. 1980).	"Apcs	97	101	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Apcs"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

In contrast to these strong associations with disease serological markers, the QTL analysis identified only two potential linkages to glomerulonephritis: one in the wild - type mice on Chromosome 7 across a 10 cM region between D7Mit246 ( 15 cM) and D7Mit145 ( 26. 5 cM) of 129 origin ( LOD 2. 86, p = 0. 0013), and one on Chromosome 17 between D17Mit100 ( 11. 7 cM) and D17Mit216 ( 29. 4 cM) from the C57BL / 6 strain ( LOD 1. 3, p = 0. 049 and LOD 1. 67, p = 0. 021 in the wild - type and Apcs - / - mice, respectively).

Thus, the congenic line carried a similar 129 region ( 80 - 106 cM) to the one present in the C57BL / 6. Apcs - / - mice ( 87. 9 - 105 cM).	"Apcs	105	109	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Apcs"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
As previously reported ( Bickerstaff et al. 1999), the levels of auto - Abs were markedly increased in the C57BL / 6. Apcs - / - compared to the wild - type C57BL / 6 controls.	"Apcs	118	122	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Apcs"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, the C57BL / 6. 129 ( D1Mit105 - 223) animals also expressed high levels of auto - Abs, and these titres were not different from those detected in the matched congenic mice containing a null mutation of the Apcs gene.	"Apcs	215	219	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Apcs"", ""start_span"": 215, ""end_span"": 219, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The influence of background genes on the development of spontaneous autoimmune disease is well known, especially with respect to the lpr and Yaa disease - susceptibility genes.

Similarly, the Y - chromosome - linked Yaa gene in BXSB and MRL / Mp males enhances the rapid development of auto - Abs and glomerulonephritis ( Izui et al. 1988; Merino et al. 1989).	"Yaa	39	42	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Yaa"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, in the C57BL / 6 background, the Yaa gene does not lead to an autoimmune phenotype ( Izui et al. 1988).	"Yaa	42	45	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Yaa"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The impact that these interacting loci may have on the lupus - like disease present in several gene - targeted animals was further assessed by comparing Apcs - / - mice with Chromosome 1 genetically matched controls.

The human serum amyloid P component binds avidly to DNA, chromatin, and apoptotic cells in physiological conditions in vitro ( Pepys 1974; Pepys and Butler 1987; Butler et al. 1990) and also to exposed chromatin and apoptotic cells in vivo ( Hintner et al. 1988; Breathnach et al. 1989; Familian et al. 2001).

We have previously reported that ( 129 x C57BL / 6). Apcs - / - mice spontaneously produce a wide range of ANAs and develop significant immune complex glomerulonephritis ( Bickerstaff et al. 1999).	"Apcs	53	57	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Apcs"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
On the basis of these observations, it was postulated that Apcs, by altering the clearance of chromatin, contributes to the pathogenesis of SLE.	"Apcs	59	63	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Apcs"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, in this study we found that only ANA and anti - chromatin Ab levels were significantly increased in the ( 129 x C57BL / 6) F2. Apcs - / - mice.	"Apcs	136	140	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Apcs"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
A possible explanation for this discrepancy may lie in the fact that the Apcs - / - mice analysed in the original study were generated from a limited number of founders and that this may have caused a nonrandom inheritance of the loci from the parental strains.	"Apcs	73	77	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Apcs"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Furthermore, the whole - genome analysis identified the 129 region surrounding the Apcs gene as the main locus contributing to the development of ANA and anti - chromatin Ab.	"Apcs	83	87	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Apcs"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In agreement with this, when we carried out a selective comparison between the ( 129 x C57BL / 6) F2. Apcs - / - mice and Chromosome 1 genetically matched controls, we failed to detect any significant difference in the levels of these two auto - Abs.	"Apcs	102	106	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Apcs"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
These findings, taken together, indicated that the phenotype associated with Apcs deficiency was caused by the presence of unaltered 129 genes from the telomeric region of Chromosome 1 operating in the C57BL / 6 genomic background.	"Apcs	77	81	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Apcs"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We adopted the same strategy to investigate the relative contribution of the 129 Chromosome 1 segment and the Apcs gene to each disease trait.	"Apcs	110	114	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Apcs"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The expression of anti - nuclear autoimmunity was identical comparing the congenic with the Apcs - / - mice.	"Apcs	92	96	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Apcs"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The only difference in phenotype between these mice was in the expression of glomerulonephritis, which was more pronounced in the Apcs - / - mice compared with the congenic mice.	"Apcs	130	134	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Apcs"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Consistent with this, a polymorphism associated with reduced basal level of C - reactive protein has been reported to be linked to SLE in humans ( Russell et al. 2004).	"C - reactive protein	76	96	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""C - reactive protein"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, as the congenic mice and the Apcs - / - mice carried similar but not identical 129 regions on Chromosome 1, an alternative explanation for our findings may still lay in the numerous and complex synergistic and counteractive interactions between 129 and C57BL / 6 genes involved in self - tolerance and end organ damage.	"Apcs	38	42	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Apcs"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, whilst the lack of lupus nephritis in the congenic mice is consistent with the need for multiple susceptibility genes for the full expression of lupus, further studies will be required to fully elucidate the role of Apcs in the pathogenesis of renal damage.

The observed perinatal lethality indicates that Ptdsr plays an important role during development.	"Ptdsr	48	53	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We first examined Ptdsr expression by X - Gal staining in heterozygous embryos staged from E9. 5 to E12. 5.	"Ptdsr	18	23	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
At E9. 5 we found Ptdsr expression in the developing neural tube, somites, heart, gut and branchial arches ( Figure 2b).	"Ptdsr	18	23	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
At E10. 5, Ptdsr expression remained high in the developing nervous system, with most intense staining in the forebrain, hindbrain and neural tube.	"Ptdsr	11	16	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
At this stage of embryogenesis, high levels of Ptdsr expression could also be detected in the developing limb buds and eyes ( Figure 2b).	"Ptdsr	47	52	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Ptdsr expression was altered at E12. 5, with most intensive beta - galactosidase staining in the eyes, developing condensations of the limb buds, neural tube and brain ( Figure 2b).	"Ptdsr	0	5	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Expression in dorsal root ganglia lateral to the neural tube and in the somites was observed; Ptdsr was expressed throughout the somite structure ( myotome, dermatome and sclerotome; Figure 2d).	"Ptdsr	94	99	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Transverse sections of the developing eye at E12. 5 revealed strong Ptdsr expression in the inner layer of the neural cup, which will later develop into the neural retina.	"Ptdsr	68	73	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Furthermore, Ptdsr expression was detected in the primary lens fiber cells of the developing lens ( Figure 2e).	"Ptdsr	13	18	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, Ptdsr is ubiquitously expressed throughout embryogenesis and in adult tissues, although at different levels.	"Ptdsr	6	11	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

We next examined the role of Ptdsr in organ development.	"Ptdsr	29	34	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

In contrast, almost no alveoli or bronchioles were present in Ptdsr - / - lungs, indicating a delay or arrest in lung sacculation and expansion.	"Ptdsr	62	67	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
A similar delay in tissue differentiation of Ptdsr - / - embryos was found in the kidneys ( Figure 3h).	"Ptdsr	45	50	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Kidneys from Ptdsr + / + embryos were well developed at E16. 5, showing terminally differentiated glomeruli with Bowman ' s capsule and collecting tubules lined with cuboidal epithelial cells ( Figure 3b).	"Ptdsr	13	18	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In contrast, Ptdsr - deficient kidneys had only primitive glomeruli at E16. 5, and collecting tubules were less well - developed.	"Ptdsr	13	18	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Instead, a large amount of undifferentiated mesenchyme was present in Ptdsr - / - kidneys ( Figure 3h).	"Ptdsr	70	75	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Ptdsr - / - embryos displayed improperly developed villi and an underdeveloped or absent submucosa ( Figure 3i).	"Ptdsr	0	5	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Such neuronal cells were absent from the intestine of Ptdsr - / - embryos ( Figure 3i), however.	"Ptdsr	54	59	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Some Ptdsr - / - mice ( 4. 5%) also displayed extensive brain malformations that resulted in externally visible head abnormalities, with occasional ectopic tissue outside the skull or exencephaly ( Figure 1f, h).	"Ptdsr	5	10	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Of note, a similar brain phenotype was observed in the Ptdsr - deficient mouse line generated by Li and colleagues [ 31].	"Ptdsr	55	60	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Ptdsr - / - lungs showed, in comparison to wild - type, only a slight delay in maturation and were fully ventilated in neonates in most cases ( Figure 3e, k).	"Ptdsr	0	5	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This demonstrates that Ptdsr - deficient mice can overcome the delay in embryonic lung differentiation and display normal lung morphology at birth.	"Ptdsr	23	28	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, it would appear highly unlikely that Ptdsr - / - mice die from respiratory failure.	"Ptdsr	43	48	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Consistent with the observations of Kunisaki and colleagues [ 32], we found severely blocked erythropoietic differentiation at an early erythroblast stage in the liver ( Figure 3f, 3l), suggesting an explanation for the grossly anemic appearance that we observed in our Ptdsr - / - mice.	"Ptdsr	270	275	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 270, ""end_span"": 275, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Loss of Ptdsr activity is associated with defects in ocular development and can lead to formation of ectopic eye structures	"Ptdsr	8	13	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
By gross morphology we could differentiate two classes of Ptdsr mutants: those that appeared normal with both eyes present ( Figure 4) and those that were severely affected and displayed uni - or bilateral anophthalmia ( Figure 5).	"Ptdsr	58	63	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
At day E16. 5, however, retinal layers in Ptdsr - / - embryos were much thinner than in wild - type embryos, contained fewer cells and were greatly reduced in size ( Figure 4b, f).	"Ptdsr	42	47	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Ptdsr - deficient animals seem to have compensated for the marked delay in cellular differentiation and expansion of retinal layers.	"Ptdsr	0	5	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Close examination of retinal structures revealed that the inner granular layer was still less expanded in Ptdsr - deficient animals, however, and that it contained fewer cells and was still severely underdeveloped in comparison with the corresponding retinal layer in control animals ( Figure 4c, 4g and 4d, 4h).	"Ptdsr	106	111	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, even mildly affected Ptdsr - / - mutants had ocular malformations with defects in differentiation of retinal structures.	"Ptdsr	27	32	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We next examined Ptdsr - / - embryos that displayed unilateral or bilateral absence of eyes ( Figure 5a) by serial sectioning of whole embryos.	"Ptdsr	17	22	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Most surprisingly, we found pigmented epithelial cells in the nasal cavity of all Ptdsr - knockout mice with anophthalmia that were analyzed histopathologically.	"Ptdsr	82	87	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Phagocytosis and clearance of apoptotic cells is normal in Ptdsr - deficient mice	"Ptdsr	59	64	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We next tested whether Ptdsr is functionally required for the clearance of apoptotic cells.	"Ptdsr	23	28	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Apoptosis of interdigital cells in the distal mesenchyme of limb buds occurs most prominently from developmental stages E12. 0 to E13. 5 and can be easily examined in situ by whole - mount terminal deoxynucleotide transferase - mediated UTP end - labeling ( TUNEL).	"terminal deoxynucleotide transferase	189	225	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""terminal deoxynucleotide transferase"", ""start_span"": 189, ""end_span"": 225, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The kinetics of cell death occurrence and regression of the interdigital web was similar in wild - type and mutant littermates, providing no evidence that Ptdsr - deficiency is associated with impaired clearance of apoptotic interdigital cells during limb development.	"Ptdsr	155	160	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 160, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Furthermore, we were unable to detect any evidence of tissue necrosis in lungs from Ptdsr - deficient mice.	"Ptdsr	84	89	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
[ 31], we never observed recruitment of neutrophils or other signs of pulmonary inflammation at any stage of development in our Ptdsr - deficient mice.	"Ptdsr	128	133	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In summary, our analysis in vivo did not reveal any impairment in apoptotic cell clearance in Ptdsr - deficient embryos during development and further suggests that phagocytosis of apoptotic cells is mainly mediated by non - professional ' bystander ' cells.	"Ptdsr	94	99	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
To determine whether macrophages from Ptdsr - knockout mice were impaired in the efficacy of apoptotic cell uptake in vitro, we performed phagocytosis assays with fetal - liver - derived macrophages ( FLDMs) and quantified their phagocytosis rates.	"Ptdsr	38	43	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
To re - examine and further independently validate the result of normal apoptotic cell uptake by Ptdsr - / - macrophages, we performed phagocytosis assays for 60 min and determined the percentage of macrophages that had engulfed apoptotic cells, in a total of at least 300 macrophages counted by fluorescence microscopy.	"Ptdsr	97	102	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Phagocytosed, 5 - carboxytetramethylrhodamine - ( TAMRA -) labeled apoptotic cells were identified as being engulfed by inclusion in F4 / 80 - labeled macrophages.	"F4 / 80	133	140	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""F4 / 80"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Moreover, single Ptdsr - / - macrophages could be identified that had engulfed even more apoptotic target cells than had wild - type macrophages ( Figure 7b, d).	"Ptdsr	17	22	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, Ptdsr - deficient macrophages had a normal ability to ingest apoptotic cells and were not impaired in recognition or phagocytosis of cells that had undergone programmed cell death.	"Ptdsr	6	11	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Ptdsr - deficiency results in reduced production of pro - and anti - inflammatory cytokines after macrophage stimulation	"Ptdsr	0	5	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In addition to its suggested importance for phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, it has been proposed that Ptdsr fulfils a second crucial role in regulating and maintaining a non - inflammatory environment upon the recognition of apoptotic cells by macrophages [ 26].	"Ptdsr	103	108	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We therefore tested whether Ptdsr - / - macrophages were able to release anti - inflammatory cytokines after ingestion of apoptotic cells.	"Ptdsr	28	33	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This indicates that ablation of Ptdsr function does not compromise in general the ability of macrophages to release immune - suppressive cytokines after recognition and engulfment of apoptotic cells.	"Ptdsr	32	37	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The difference in TNF - alpha secretion was first visible after 3 h of LPS stimulation and became more prominent during the course of the experiment ( for example, after 9 h and 12 h of LPS stimulation; Figure 8c).

These results indicate that Ptdsr is not required in macrophages for the inhibition of pro - inflammatory signaling after recognition and engulfment of apoptotic cells.

While this work was in progress, two other groups reported the generation of Ptdsr - deficient mice [ 31, 32].	"Ptdsr	77	82	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

In our case, the Ptdsr - null allele was generated in an isogenic C57BL / 6J background, whereas Li et al.	"Ptdsr	17	22	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
[ 32] investigated the phenotype of their Ptdsr - knockout mice in a mixed 129 x C57BL / 6 background.	"Ptdsr	42	47	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
At E16. 5 almost no branching morphogenesis of the lung epithelium was observed in Ptdsr - / - lungs.	"Ptdsr	83	88	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
When compared with wild - type controls, intestinal tissues of Ptdsr knockout mice appeared unstructured, with an absence of enteric ganglia and of differentiated smooth muscle tissue.

Interestingly, defects in kidney and intestine differentiation were not described in the Ptdsr - knockouts generated by Li et al.	"Ptdsr	89	94	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Surprisingly, when we examined Ptdsr - / - embryos shortly before birth ( E18. 5) or neonatally, we found only mild differentiation delays in organs that appeared severely affected at mid - gestation.

This ' recovery ' was most visible in Ptdsr - / - lungs: at P0 we found expanded lungs in the knockout mice that showed normal branching patterns, with differentiated alveoli and bronchioles.

We investigated the occurrence of programmed cell death during lung development in wild - type and Ptdsr - knockout mice throughout embryogenesis ( E16. 5 to P0).	"Ptdsr	99	104	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

Furthermore, we failed to detect any differences in the number of apoptotic cells in Ptdsr - knockout and wild - type animals in the rare cases where we could detect apoptotic cells within lung tissues.

In addition, Li and colleagues [ 31] demonstrated that surfactant expression is normal in Ptdsr - deficient animals, supporting the idea of normal maturation of surfactant - producing type II alveolar epithelial cells and lung function.

Other defects must therefore be responsible for the death of Ptdsr - mutant mice.	"Ptdsr	61	66	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Indeed, very recently we have obtained strong evidence that Ptdsr - knockout mice die as a result of defects in heart development that are associated with specific cardiopulmonary malformations; ( J. E. Schneider, J. B., S. D. Bamfort, A. D. G., C. Broadbent, K. Clarke, S. Neubauer, A. L. and S. Battacharya, unpublished observations).

In addition, we demonstrate that eye development requires a functional Ptdsr gene.	"Ptdsr	71	76	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Ptdsr - deficient embryos can be roughly divided into two categories.	"Ptdsr	0	5	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
A possible explanation for these two phenotypes can be found in the expression pattern of the Ptdsr gene.	"Ptdsr	94	99	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Initially, Ptdsr is expressed throughout the whole developing nervous system, with exceptionally high levels in the anterior part of the forebrain.	"Ptdsr	11	16	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, Ptdsr might play an important role in early events of ocular morphogenesis, such as establishment and bisection of eye fields and formation of optic cups.	"Ptdsr	6	11	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Interestingly, we occasionally observed serious malformations of forebrain and nasal structures in Ptdsr - knockout embryos that were associated with bilateral anophthalmia ( see for example the mutant embryo in Figure 1g).	"Ptdsr	99	104	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
[ 31] found smaller lenses in Ptdsr - knockout mice and described the formation of retinal protrusions, although anophthalmia and specific differentiation defects of retinal cell layers were not reported in their study.

Furthermore, cell death during normal retinal development occurs in retinal layers distinct from the inner granular layer where we observed the most pronounced differentiation defects in the Ptdsr - / - mutants described here.

[ 31], we found particular brain malformations in our Ptdsr - / - mice.	"Ptdsr	54	59	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ptdsr"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The multiple defects in tissue differentiation cannot be explained by failure of apoptotic cell clearance, as this process is normal in our Ptdsr - knockout line.

Furthermore, phagocytosis assays in vitro demonstrated a completely normal uptake of apoptotic cells by Ptdsr - / - macrophages, with some knockout macrophages showing loads even higher than wild - type of engulfed dead cells.

As recognition of phosphatidylserine is thought to be a universal engulfment mechanism for all cells that are able to phagocytose apoptotic cells, it is very striking that apoptotic cell clearance mediated by non - professional bystander cells is also not compromised by Ptdsr - deficiency.

We performed phagocytosis assays in vitro with fetal - liver - derived macrophages, while in their assays, Li and colleagues used thioglycollate - elicited peritoneal macrophages after adoptive transfer of Ptdsr - / - hematopoietic stem cells.

Thus, it seems possible that recruitment and activation / differentiation of macrophages after adoptive transfer and thioglycollate elicitation are affected by Ptdsr - deficiency.

We do not think that the different results observed in Ptdsr - knockout mice in a mixed C57BL / 6 x 129 background and in a pure C57BL / 6J background can be attributed to genetic background effects: comparison of apoptotic cell engulfment efficacies of thioglycollate - elicited macrophages from 129P2 / OlaHsd and C57BL / 6J mice did not show any differences in apoptotic cell uptake ( J.

This opens up the possibility either that there is an as - yet unknown Ptdsr receptor, which might act as a primary phosphatidylserine recognition receptor, or that recognition of phosphatidylserine and subsequent apoptotic cell engulfment and anti - inflammatory signaling are mainly mediated through phosphatidylserine bridging proteins and their cognate receptors.

NT - 3 is expressed in the ventral spinal cord, in the developing limb buds, and in intrafusal bag fibers of muscle spindles later in development ( Copray and Brouwer 1994; Fari n as et al. 1996; Tojo et al. 1996).

Absence of muscle spindles might be due to a failure in initiation of differentiation by proprioceptive axons, or a failure of maturation and maintenance in the absence of NT - 3.

DiI labeling through the DRGs revealed numerous fibers entering the spinal cord at ectopic regions and growing towards the NT - 3 beads ( Figure 6A), surrounding the beads and forming bundles around them ( Figure 6C - 6E).	"NT - 3	123	129	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""NT - 3"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
NT - 3 is therefore capable of acting as a chemoattractant for DRG axons.	"NT - 3	0	6	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""NT - 3"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 6, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

Conversely, beads soaked with neurotrophin function - blocking antibodies led to reduction of sensory and motor axon growth towards the limb.	"neurotrophin	30	42	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""neurotrophin"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

However, earlier findings of normal proprioceptive afferent trajectories in chicken embryos despite injection of function - blocking NT - 3 antibody into the spinal cord ( Oakley et al. 1995) led them to discount this possibility.	"NT - 3	133	139	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""NT - 3"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In that study, though, assays on the effectiveness of antibody perturbation on NT - 3 - dependent cell survival showed that effectiveness was significant ( approximately 90%) but not complete ( Oakley et al. 1995).

Our present results are in agreement with these observations, and provide further evidence that NT - 3 acts as a chemoattractant for sensory afferents.	"NT - 3	96	102	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""NT - 3"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, it is unclear whether NT - 3 is absent from the ventral spinal cords of these animals.	"NT - 3	31	37	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""NT - 3"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The possibility has been raised that motor neurons may retrogradely transport NT - 3 in muscle to the spinal cord ( Chen and Frank 1999).	"NT - 3	78	84	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""NT - 3"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Assays to determine whether any NT - 3 is present in the ventral horns of these mice would be informative.	"NT - 3	32	38	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""NT - 3"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Their observations are based on PV immunostaining and DiI labeling of the peripheral nerves.	"PV	32	34	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""PV"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Seventy - three percent of retrogradely labeled gastrocnemius muscle afferents were reported to be expressing TrkC RNA in the adult rat DRG, although some of these ( about 10%) may represent cutaneous innervation ( McMahon et al. 1994).	"TrkC	110	114	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""TrkC"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Presently, it is not clear whether TrkC protein is also made by cutaneous afferents and if so at what stage in development this receptor is expressed by cutaneous axons.	"TrkC	35	39	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""TrkC"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Altogether, our findings suggest a role for NT - 3 in initiation of muscle innervation and spindle differentiation by the proprioceptive axons.	"NT - 3	44	50	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""NT - 3"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
They found that in the spinal cord of Er81 KO mice, ventral projections of proprioceptive axons were mostly absent, and very few axons made it to the ventral cord.	"Er81	38	42	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Er81"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
While the phenotype of Er81 KO mice is quite dramatic, and most proprioceptive axons stop within the intermediate spinal cord, it is important to note that a few axons still find their way to the ventral spinal cord and target properly to the motor neurons ( Arber et al. 2000).	"Er81	23	27	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Er81"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

Patel et al. argue that since motor neurons are absent in these mice, NT - 3 secreted by them could not be a signal for proprioceptive axons to enter the lateral motor columns.	"NT - 3	70	76	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""NT - 3"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Studies in embryonic mice reported NT - 3 mRNA in the ventral horns of the spinal cord, but it is not definitive that both mRNA and protein are expressed solely by motor neurons.	"NT - 3	35	41	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""NT - 3"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In the adult spinal cord, while motor neurons express high levels of NT - 3, other cells, including glia, also express it ( Zhou and Rush 1994; Dreyfus et al. 1999; Buck et al. 2000).	"NT - 3	69	75	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""NT - 3"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Finally, in culture assays, we see a strong chemoattraction of DRG neurons to localized sources of NT - 3.	"NT - 3	99	105	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""NT - 3"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Furthermore, in vitro, sensory axon response to NT - 3 does not appear to be dose - dependent ( Ringstedt et al. 1997; Tucker et al. 2001).	"NT - 3	48	54	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""NT - 3"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Along the monosynaptic stretch reflex pathway, only Wnt - 3 has been implicated as an axon arborization factor in the spinal cord ( Krylova et al. 2002).	"Wnt - 3	52	59	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Wnt - 3"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Another molecule, Slit2, expressed in the midline and by motor neurons ( Wang et al. 1999) is capable of inducing axonal branching ( Nguyen Ba - Charvet et al. 2001; O zdinler and Erzurumlu 2002).	"Slit2	18	23	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Slit2"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, Slit2 might also be involved in terminal branching of propioceptive axons in the ventral cord and in the midline branching observed in our double KOs.	"Slit2	6	11	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Slit2"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, no defects in axon pathfinding along the monosynaptic reflex arc or in muscle spindle differentiation have been noted in PV KO mice, which develop normally and show no apparent changes in their behavior or physical activity ( Schwaller et al. 1999).	"PV	130	132	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""PV"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Our present results suggest that NT - 3 acts as a short - range axon guidance cue for proprioceptive axons centrally and peripherally, as they navigate to their targets using other axon guidance cues.	"NT - 3	33	39	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""NT - 3"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

On a bubble substrate, Mcm4 / 6 / 7 makes symmetric dual contacts with the 5 ' - proximal 25 nt single - stranded segments adjacent to the branch points, presumably generating double hexamers.

Loss of thymine residues from one single - strand results in significant decrease of unwinding efficacy, suggesting that concurrent bidirectional unwinding by a single double hexameric Mcm4 / 6 / 7 may play a role in efficient unwinding of the bubble.

Among the several stable subcomplexes which MCM proteins can generate, only the Mcm4 / 6 / 7 complex has been shown to possess an intrinsic DNA helicase activity ( 10 - 14, 17 - 18).

Consistent with this notion, the processivity of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe and mouse Mcm4 / 6 / 7 complexes is significantly stimulated on forked DNA structures and it can unwind duplex DNA of 400 - 500 bp ( 13, 14).

Recently, we reported that the helicase and ATP hydrolysis activities of mammalian Mcm4 / 6 / 7 are specifically activated by single - stranded DNA containing stretches of thymine residues and proposed a novel model that Mcm may play a crucial role in selection of replication origins in higher eukaryotes ( 13).

In this report, in order to clarify the mode of action of the Mcm helicase and obtain insight into how it may function at the replication forks in vivo, we have conducted detailed analyses of helicase action and DNA binding of mouse Mcm4 / 6 / 7 helicase using various forked and bubble substrate DNAs.

The results indicate that mammalian Mcm4 / 6 / 7 primarily binds to single - stranded DNA region, and that the extent of helicase activation is related to the thymine content of the single - stranded segment.

Careful examination of Mcm4 / 6 / 7 footprints on a bubble indicated strong protection on the 5 ' - half of the top strand and moderate protection on the remaining 3 ' - half, as well as on several base - pair duplex segment adjacent to the branch point ( Figure 1A and data not shown).

These results indicate that Mcm4 / 6 / 7 protein primarily interacts with single - stranded DNA region and that the interaction also spans the duplex segments near the branchpoint of the replication fork.

The above results suggest that Mcm4 / 6 / 7 generates a double hexameric complex on a bubble, each hexamer of which makes symmetric contact with the 5 ' - proximal central single - stranded segment.

In fact, we previously showed that the Mcm4 / 6 / 7 mainly forms a single hexameric complex on bubble - 20 ( a bubble substrate with 20 nt long central single - stranded segment) and a double hexameric complex on bubble - 60 DNA ( 13).	"Mcm4	39	43	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm4"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In order to determine the minimum requirement for double - hexamer formation, a set of synthetic bubble - like substrates ( Bub - T10, Bub - T20, Bub - T30, Bub - T40 and Bub - T50) that differed in the length of the central unpaired segment were constructed, and the binding and helicase activities of Mcm4 / 6 / 7 on these substrates were examined.

Taken together, the above results are consistent with the notion that the Mcm4 / 6 / 7 complex, loaded onto DNA as a double hexameric complex, efficiently unwinds the duplex region of the substrate DNA.

Symmetric binding of the Mcm4 / 6 / 7 double hexamer to bubble suggests that each hexamer catalyzes unwinding of one of the two duplex segments.	"Mcm4	25	29	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm4"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The preferred bubble substrate which is efficiently unwound by Mcm4 / 6 / 7 contains thymine stretches on both strands of the single - stranded segment.	"Mcm4	63	67	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm4"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We constructed a hetero - bubble ( Bub66 / T - G - rich) in which one strand is T - rich ( same as Bub66 / T - rich) and the other strand is G - rich ( same as Bub66 / G - rich) ( 13), and helicase assays were conducted with increasing amount of Mcm4 / 6 / 7.

Since Mcm4 / 6 / 7 can bind to Bub66 / T - G - rich and forms a double hexameric complex ( data not shown), the defective unwinding is not due to inefficient loading of the helicase onto the substrate.

However, we did not detect such intermediates during the course of the experiment ( Figure 3B), suggesting that bubble can be displaced efficiently only when two molecules of the Mcm4 / 6 / 7 hexamers are simultaneously activated.

In contrast, only the substrate containing a 3 ' single - stranded DNA tail ( A - fork [ 5 ']) was efficiently unwound and A - fork [ 3 '] or A - fork [ 3 ', 5 '], was not unwound by Mcm4 / 6 / 7 ( Figure 4B).

Absence of helicase actions on A - fork [ 3 ', 5 '] composed only of duplex regions is expected since double - stranded DNA is not able to activate the ATPase activity of Mcm4 / 6 / 7 ( 10).

In contrast, the PriA, a structure - specific helicase used as a control, binds at the fork junction and unwinds the fork and the nascent lagging strand DNA on A - fork [ 5 '], or unwinds the nascent lagging strand on A - fork [ 3 ', 5 '], as reported before ( 25).

These results indicate that the Mcm4 / 6 / 7 complex binds to single - stranded DNA and that its helicase is activated only in the presence of a single - stranded 3 ' - tail.

We have constructed 3 ' - extension substrates containing poly ( dT), poly ( dA), poly ( dC) and poly ( dG) 3 ' - tails in order to examine whether mouse Mcm4 / 6 / 7 can displace these substrates.

We first found that Mcm4 / 6 / 7 binds to dT -, dC - and dG - 3 ' - extension with similar affinity, and to dA - 3 ' - extension with much lower affinity ( Figure 5A).

This is consistent with the previous results that Mcm4 / 6 / 7 binds to 50mer oligo - dT, - dC and - dG, but not to a 50mer oligo - dA ( 13).	"Mcm4	50	54	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm4"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We found that dT - tailed 3 ' - extension was displaced efficiently by Mcm 4 / 6 / 7 while almost no or very little activity was detected on other substrates ( Figure 5B and C).

This is in sharp contrast to yeast Mcm4 / 6 / 7 helicases which are not capable of unwinding 3 ' - extension substrates.	"Mcm4	35	39	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm4"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Furthermore, dT - tailed 5 ' - extension, to which Mcm4 / 6 / 7 could bind, was not displaced by the Mcm helicase.	"Mcm4	51	55	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm4"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
A partial heteroduplex M13 single - stranded DNA containing a 37 bp duplex region in the presence or absence of the 50 nt long 3 ' - tail of various nucleotide compositions were constructed and the unwinding by mouse Mcm4 / 6 / 7 was examined ( Figure 6A).

Due to its low processivity, Mcm4 / 6 / 7 barely displaced the annealed 37mer oligonucleotide without a 3 ' - tail ( 37mer; Figure 6A).	"Mcm4	29	33	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm4"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Partial heteroduplex substrates containing the 3 ' - tail of TC25, TTCC13, TTTCCC8, TTTTCCCC6, TTCC17 were displaced by the Mcm4 / 6 / 7 complex to the extent similar to that achieved by TTA17, suggesting that 50% thymine content is sufficient for full activation of Mcm helicase.

Our previous studies have shown that the sequences containing periodic ( dT) n tracts derived from the human lamin B2 origin ( 48% thymine content) can serve as an efficient activator for the Mcm helicase on a bubble, and replacement of thymines with guanines abolished the helicase activation ( 13, 28).

This DUE is believed to coincide with the initially unwound region of the c - myc origin ( 29), and its deletion substantially reduced the replicator activity ( 30).

This result also indicates that sequences with 37% thymine content can activate Mcm4 / 6 / 7 to displace 24 nt duplex on both sides in a bubble substrate, suggesting that the not only thymine content but also the sequence context may affect the Mcm helicase activation.

DNA unwinding by Mcm4 / 6 / 7 is inhibited by the GC - rich sequences on the duplex segment	"Mcm4	17	21	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm4"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We found that the Mcm4 / 6 / 7 helicase can displace duplex DNA up to 350 nt long on its own on the former substrate ( Figure 8D, left), consistent with previous results ( 13).	"Mcm4	18	22	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm4"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In contrast, displacement was inhibited over the GC - rich segments on the latter substrate ( Figure 8D, right panel), although displacement up to 250 nt in length, albeit at a reduced level, was observed at a high concentration of Mcm4 / 6 / 7 complex.

These results may indicate that the presence of thymine - adenine pairs with a certain frequency in the duplex region may facilitate continuous unwinding by Mcm4 / 6 / 7.

Alternatively, Mcm4 / 6 / 7 is not efficient enough to displace thermodynamically stable GC - base - paired segment.	"Mcm4	15	19	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm4"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Mcm4 / 6 / 7 hardly displaced the 31 nt long duplex of GCC: CGG repeats, whereas the T - fork / ( GAA: CTT) 10 was displaced efficiently, as described above.	"Mcm4	0	4	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm4"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
T - fork / ( GCC: CIG) 10 was displaced with efficiency much greater than that of T - fork / ( GCC: CGG) 10, indicating that the thermostability of the duplex segment, not the lack of AT base pair, is responsible for inability of Mcm4 / 6 / 7 to displace the duplex.

In this report, we have conducted detailed analyses on binding and helicase actions of mouse Mcm4 / 6 / 7 using various substrates including fork and bubble structures.

Modes of binding and activation of Mcm4 / 6 / 7 helicase on a bubble structure	"Mcm4	35	39	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm4"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We previously reported that Mcm4 / 6 / 7 can be loaded onto a bubble - like structure and can serve as a DNA helicase at the forks ( 13).	"Mcm4	28	32	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm4"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The ability of Mcm4 / 6 / 7 to unwind the bubble substrate but not the conventional duplex DNA ( Figures 2 and 13) indicates that Mcm can be loaded through the single - stranded segment of the bubble.	"Mcm4	15	19	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm4"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Furthermore, the Mcm4 / 6 / 7 complex displays marked preference for thymine - rich sequences within the single - stranded segment for helicase activation ( 13).	"Mcm4	17	21	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm4"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Our footprinting analyses showed that Mcm4 / 6 / 7 strongly protects 25 nt single - stranded DNA segment adjacent to each branch point and proximal to 5 ' ends of both strands of the bubble.	"Mcm4	38	42	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm4"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
At each fork, one Mcm4 / 6 / 7 complex is likely to encircle the single - stranded DNA strand and two hexamers may bind symmetrically to the bubble substrate, forming a double hexameric structure on the bubble ( see schematic drawing of Figure 1A).

This may closely resemble the proposed modes of binding and helicase actions of T - antigen ( 21).	"T - antigen	80	91	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""T - antigen"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

DNA binding assays indicate that Mcm4 / 6 / 7 binds to those substrates containing single - stranded DNA regions regardless of the presence or absence of single - stranded 3 ' or 5 ' end.	"Mcm4	33	37	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm4"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, it does not necessarily require 3 ' end of single - stranded DNA, since Mcm4 / 6 / 7 can displace annealing oligonucleotide on a circular single - stranded DNA.

The archaeal Mcm can unwind A - fork [ 3 '] but eukaryotic Mcm4 / 6 / 7 cannot, since the former binds to double - stranded DNA but the latter does not ( 5, 27).	"Mcm4	59	63	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm4"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
While yeast Mcm helicases can translocate on duplex DNA, such activity was not observed with mammalian Mcm4 / 6 / 7 ( data not shown).	"Mcm4	103	107	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm4"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Occurrence of AT - rich sequences, with asymmetric distribution of adenine and thymine, near the replication origins, lead us to propose that Mcm may play a role in selection of initiation sites of mammalian DNA replication, and prompted us to examine the ability of sequences from human replication origins to activate Mcm4 / 6 / 7 helicase.	"Mcm4	320	324	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm4"", ""start_span"": 320, ""end_span"": 324, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Consistent with it, site - specific loading of Mcm in the DNA replication initiation zone of the c - myc was recently reported ( 33).	"c - myc	97	104	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""c - myc"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The stretches of thymine residues may not be necessarily required, since repeats of TC dinucleotides served as a potent activator for Mcm4 / 6 / 7.	"Mcm4	134	138	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm4"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, we have concluded that Mcm4 / 6 / 7 helicase is most efficiently activated by non - structured single - stranded DNA with thymine content of 50% or more, although significant stimulation is observed also by DNA with less thymine content ( Figure 7), suggesting that the sequence specificity for Mcm helicase activation is rather relaxed and that the extent of the activation may depend on the sequence context.

Duplex DNA composed only of GC pairs ( 10 repeats of CGG) on a Y - fork was not displaced at all, while the same template was readily displaced by SV40 T - antigen ( Figure 8B).

However, on this substrate, Mcm4 / 6 / 7 was able to displace DNA past the GC - rich region, albeit to a limited extent, when it was added at a high concentration.	"Mcm4	28	32	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Mcm4"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
These results indicate either that thymine residues are required on the duplex DNA for continuous unwinding, or that Mcm4 / 6 / 7 is simply not efficient enough to unwind the stable GC pairs.

Replacement of the central guanosine with inosine in the CGG repeat duplex DNA resulted in displacement ( Figure 8E) ( 31), suggesting that the continuous presence of AT base pair may not be essential for the Mcm helicase function and that the thermostability of GC base pairs is inhibitory for helicase action of Mcm4 / 6 / 7.

The results described in this manuscript reveal potentially important features of mammalian Mcm4 / 6 / 7 helicase, which is likely to be a key component of the eukaryotic replicative helicase.

This process would involve melting of duplex DNA, which may be facilitated by binding of preRC components in the context of proper chromatin structures, or by other unwinding factors including a topoisomerase or a newly identified Mcm8 helicase ( 34 - 36).

Huntingtin is postulated to function as a flexible ~ 350 kDa HEAT domain scaffold that may facilitate the assembly and possibly the subcellular location of large protein complexes [ 3 - 7].

Extraembryonic tissues are essential for supplying nutrients and signals that direct anterior / posterior axis formation and patterning in the developing embryo ( reviewed in [ 17]), implicating huntingtin in either or both of these processes.

The lack of a morphological node and presence of a shortened streak, together with reduced neuroectoderm and lack of headfolds, suggest that anterior streak formation may be impaired in huntingtin deficient embryos.

However, close inspection of the data reveals abnormal patterning within this tissue and its derivatives. T, normally expressed in the primitive streak, node and axial head process / notochord mesoderm [ 22], is detected in the shortened streak and axial mesoderm in Hdhex4 / 5 / Hdhex4 / 5 embryos, extending rostrally from a region of weakly positive cells ( Fig. 2A, B).

Similarly, Evx1, normally expressed in primitive streak mesoderm at E7. 5 with highest levels in proximal cells [ 23], is expressed in the proximal shortened streak but is also aberrantly expressed throughout the extraembryonic mesoderm, allantois and chorion ( Fig. 2E, F).

Therefore, misexpression of either or both of these factors, or of goosecoid, in the visceral endoderm could contribute to the Hdhex4 / 5 / Hdhex4 / 5 mutant phenotype.

In addition, it is possible that other extraembryonic signal ( s) that we have not analyzed may also be affected by the lack of huntingtin activity in extraembryonic cells in mutant embryos.

Huntingtin deficient embryos also fail to form headfolds, and to undergo organogenesis, even after culturing in nutrient rich media.	"Huntingtin	0	10	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Huntingtin"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In addition, since node formation is not required for neural induction [ 44 - 46], the failure to form a node in huntingtin deficient embryos is also unlikely to explain the lack of headfolds.

Thus, our observations provide unexpected starting - points in the search for huntingtin ' s precise molecular activities, which began with the discovery that this HEAT domain protein hosts the dominant polyglutamine property that is the fundamental basis of HD pathogenesis.

Our findings indicate that huntingtin is required for proper patterning of the epiblast during early embryogenesis, for proper anterior streak and node formation, primitive streak progression, paraxial mesoderm and head fold formation, as well as for the proper restriction of transiently expressed growth and transcription factor genes.

These will be important for implicating candidates to be assessed in the extraembryonic signals that determine anterior streak progression in the developing embryo and in delineating the dominant activity of the polyglutamine tract in huntingtin that determines the striatal specificity of HD.

Under basal conditions, the protein resides in subapical intracellular vesicles; however, under conditions requiring water retention AQP2 translocates to the apical membrane, permitting water reabsorption [ 7, 8].

Sequencing of Aqp2 coding region of affected mice identified a thymine to guanine ( T to G) transversion ( Figure 1A), which is predicted to lead to a valine for phenylalanine substitution at amino acid 204 of the protein ( F204V).

"GluR - B depletion in forebrain was ectopically variable ( "" mosaic "") among individuals and strongly correlated with decreased olfactory memory in hippocampus and cortex."

Thus, correlated differences in behavior and levels of GluR - B expression allowed a mechanistic and spatial dissection of olfactory learning, discrimination, and memory capabilities.

Given that neuronal circuits underlying odor discrimination, as well as olfactory memory, rely on properties of fast excitatory neurotransmission mediated by alpha - amino - 3 - hydroxy - 5 - methyl - 4 - isoxazolepropionate receptors ( AMPARs), we sought to alter, by genetic means, the specific functional contribution of alpha - amino - 3 - hydroxy - 5 - methyl - 4 - isoxazolepropionate ( AMPA) channels containing the dominant subunit GluR - B.	"GluR - B	440	448	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 440, ""end_span"": 448, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
GluR - B is critically involved in the formation and trafficking of AMPARs, and dominates their ion conductance and gating properties [ 40 - 46].	"GluR - B	0	8	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Concerning this intended switch in AMPAR properties, mice lacking all GluR - B, however, show a widespread impairment in behavior, including lethargy, motor coordination problems, and deficits in exploratory activity [ 51], which preclude detailed behavioral analyses.	"GluR - B	70	78	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Similarly, mice expressing ( in the entire brain) a substantial part of the GluR - B population in the Q / R site - unedited form become seizure - prone and die prematurely [ 53].	"GluR - B	76	84	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Some of these problems can be partially overcome by use of spatially and temporally restricted expression systems [ 54 - 56], in particular the Cre - lox system, with Cre - recombinase expression in defined brain areas of gene - targeted mice carrying GluR - B alleles marked by loxP sites for Cre - mediated recombination [ 55, 57].

Indeed, restricting the expression of Q / R site - unedited GluR - B to forebrain resulted in almost normal lifespan and an only weakly seizure - prone phenotype [ 58].

Mice with forebrain - specific GluR - B depletion appeared almost completely normal throughout life with no developmental abnormalities, thus permitting a detailed, quantitative investigation of olfactory behavior.

These efforts allowed us to dissect, both spatially and mechanistically, the role of GluR - B - mediated AMPAR properties in selected brain regions in odor learning, discrimination, and memory.

To ascertain if enhanced olfactory learning and odor discrimination may indeed correlate with the increased Ca2 + permeability of AMPA channels in the Q / R site - unedited form, we next analyzed GluR - B Delta FB mice, which lack GluR - B in forebrain.

However, GluR - B depletion is not lethal and does not produce seizures.	"GluR - B	9	17	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Hence, unlike the complete GluR - B knockouts, GluR - B Delta FB mice show only very minor changes in general activity and no sign of any major developmental disturbance, thus allowing detailed, quantitative behavioral investigations.	"GluR - B	27	35	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
As activity, measured by the intertrial interval, was not significantly different between genotypes ( F ( 1, 16) = 3. 1; p = 0. 1), and analysis of the lick frequency showed a tendency to reduced motivation of GluR - B Delta FB mice in this particular task ( F ( 1, 16) = 9. 2; p < 0. 01), we conclude that depletion of GluR - B in forebrain areas indeed resulted in increased olfactory learning and discrimination performances, rather than motivational alterations.	"GluR - B	210	218	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 210, ""end_span"": 218, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

To quantify the relation between residual GluR - B protein and olfactory memory, the memory experiment was repeated with nine additional GluR - B Delta FB mice and two GluR - B2lox control animals ( indicated with shaded symbols in Figure 4A), resulting in the same mean, variability, and range of memory performance ( control: 89 +/- 10%; GluR - B Delta FB: 63 +/- 14%).	"GluR - B	42	50	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Subsequently, protein was extracted from olfactory bulbs, cortical areas, and hippocampi from each mouse, and GluR - B protein was quantified ( Figure 4C).	"GluR - B	110	118	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Whereas no learning or discrimination - related parameter correlated with residual protein levels ( Figure 4D, R2 < 0. 3), a strong correlation between memory and GluR - B protein was observed in hippocampus ( Figure 4D, R2 = 0. 72, p < 0. 003, n = 10) and cortical areas ( Figure 4D, R2 = 0. 62, p < 0. 006, n = 10).

Thus, although both are mediated by alterations in the AMPAR subunit GluR - B, due to the qualitatively different dose - response curves, the phenotypes regarding olfactory memory, and olfactory learning / discrimination must be mechanistically distinct.

To obtain independent evidence for this spatial and mechanistic dissection of the roles of Ca2 + - permeable AMPARs, we expressed by transgenic means N - terminally green fluorescent protein ( GFP) - tagged GluR - B specifically in hippocampus and piriform cortex of GluR - B Delta FB mice ( Figure 5A and 5B).	"GluR - B	207	215	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 207, ""end_span"": 215, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In accordance with the proposed region - dependence, we expected that additional GluR - B subunits in hippocampus and / or piriform cortex improve odor memory but do not alter odor discrimination performance.	"GluR - B subunits	81	98	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B subunits"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The transactivator was under the control of a modified alpha CaMKII - promoter fragment to obtain high expression selectivity ( Figure 5A; see also Materials and Methods).	"alpha CaMKII	55	67	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""alpha CaMKII"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The transgenic expression level of GFPGluR - B was 9. 72% +/- 1. 25 ( n = 3) in the hippocampus, compared with endogenous GluR - B ( Figure 5C and 5D).	"GluR - B	38	46	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In the olfactory memory experiments with GluR - B Delta FB animals, olfactory memory linearly depended on GluR - B expression in cortex and hippocampus with a slope of 9. 1 +/- 2. 5% ( cortex) and 8. 9 +/- 2. 0% ( hippocampus) increase in memory per 10% increase in protein ( Figure 4D).	"GluR - B	41	49	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
A 9. 7% increase in GluR - B in these brain regions, as achieved by GluR - BRescue animals ( Figure 5), is thus predicted to increase olfactory memory by approximately 9% throughout the heterogeneous population ( blue line in Figure 6B).	"GluR - B	20	28	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, odor discrimination ( measured by the discrimination index as in Figures 1, 2, and 4D) was as enhanced as in GluR - B Delta FB mice ( 0. 79 +/- 0. 05, mean +/- SEM compared with 0. 76 +/- 0. 02, p > 0. 7, Figure 6C), and improved relative to GluR - B2lox controls ( 0. 48 +/- 0. 06; Figure 6C; overall ANOVA: F ( 2, 41) = 17. 2, p < 10 - 5; post hoc Newman Keuls: p < 10 - 3), as expected if the enhanced discrimination phenotype is due to Ca2 + - permeable AMPARs in the olfactory bulb and unaffected by GluR - B expression in piriform cortex or hippocampus.

In a nutshell, we conclude that olfactory discrimination is enhanced by an increase in AMPAR - mediated Ca2 + permeability within the olfactory bulb, whereas olfactory memory becomes impaired upon genetically induced GluR - B ablation in higher brain centers, specifically in piriform cortex.	"GluR - B	217	225	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 217, ""end_span"": 225, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
"A detailed analysis of the sampling pattern [ 3], and in particular the analysis of discrimination tasks that involved "" simple "" dissimilar monomolecular odor pairs and "" difficult "" binary mixtures, were necessary to fully capture the characteristics of the olfactory discrimination phenotype for forebrain - specific GluR - B - depleted mice."

Furthermore, increased performance even after long stretches of training and, in particular, increased sampling pattern differences ( TB and ATS, unpublished data) supported the notion that GluR - B depletion resulted in enhanced odor discrimination capability.

AMPAR currents are reduced in mice not expressing GluR - B [ 51], possibly due to fewer synaptic AMPA channels and impaired AMPAR trafficking and recycling.	"GluR - B	50	58	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The milder phenotype upon GluR - B depletion could be attributed to reduced AMPAR densities at synapses [ 40, 41] and therefore probably to a lesser extent of Ca2 + influx.	"GluR - B	26	34	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Normally, GluR - B - containing AMPARs are prominently localized at the dendrodendritic synapse between mitral and granule cells in the olfactory bulb [ 64, 65].	"GluR - B	10	18	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Notably, the improved olfactory discrimination capabilities were apparent even upon relatively small reductions in GluR - B levels.	"GluR - B	115	123	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Finally, in other memory - related tasks, such as a hippocampus - dependent spatial reference memory task ( Figure S2), mice with GluR - B depletion were not impaired after task acquisition.	"GluR - B	130	138	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We therefore conclude that forebrain - specific ablation of GluR - B results in a specific loss of long - term olfactory memory but, at the same time, in enhanced odor discrimination and learning capabilities.	"GluR - B	60	68	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Therefore, residual GluR - B levels were determined from each mouse that had been tested in the behavioral experiments, and levels were correlated with odor learning, discrimination, and olfactory memory.	"GluR - B	20	28	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The significant direct correlation between residual GluR - B levels in hippocampus and cortical areas with olfactory memory suggested hippocampal and / or cortical neurons as putative mediators for odor memorization and / or storage.	"GluR - B	52	60	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This is furthermore consistent with a prominent role of cortical areas or hippocampus in olfactory memory, although GluR - B levels in the olfactory bulb were also weakly correlated with memory performance.	"GluR - B	116	124	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Transgenic expression of GFPGluR - B in piriform cortex and hippocampus indeed rescued memory to an extent strikingly consistent with the transgenic protein levels ( approximately 10% of wild - type GluR - B), confirming the reliability of the correlation analysis and the sensitivity of the behavioral assay.	"GluR - B	28	36	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
What could be the cellular basis of the long - term memory deficit brought about by lack of GluR - B - containing AMPARs?	"GluR - B	92	100	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
For complete GluR - B knockouts, increased long - term plasticity ( LTP) was reported in hippocampal field recordings [ 51].	"GluR - B	13	21	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In addition, in hippocampal and amygdala pathways lacking GluR - B, an AMPAR - dependent, N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA) receptor - independent form of LTP can be readily induced [ 51, 52].	"GluR - B	58	66	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Mechanistically, this is likely to be due to Ca2 + influx through GluR - B - less AMPA channels leading to non - hebbian forms of plasticity.	"GluR - B	66	74	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
A critical step in discerning the discrimination and learning phenotypes from the memory phenotype was the observation of increased variability in the memory of the GluR - B knockout animals and, subsequently, the individual analyses of protein expression levels.	"GluR - B	165	173	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""GluR - B"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We made use of the epigenetic variability in GluR - B excision that could be correlated to the variability in memory but showed no correlation to variability in discrimination.

We could thus provide evidence for opposing roles of specific GluR - B manipulation and increased Ca2 + influx via AMPARs in olfactory discrimination / learning, and memory, potentially in the olfactory bulb and piriform cortex, respectively.

The strong expression levels produced with the tet - off vectors, combined with the ability to reduce this expression by several orders of magnitude with tetracycline [ 14], allowed for a stringent test of how a highly effective pharmaceutical inhibitor of A beta production would impact the progression of amyloid pathology and whether reversal of these lesions might be possible following such treatment.

This latter finding indicates that compared to other disease - associated protein aggregates such as mutant huntingtin, which clear in less than 3 mo [ 32], the disaggregation of extracellular amyloid is relatively slow.

At the latest treatment interval analyzed by ELISA, animals administered dox for 6 mo showed elevated levels of PBS - soluble A beta ( see Figure 5) that could be interpreted as an indication that the plaques are slowly releasing peptide ( or oligomeric A beta) into the soluble pool and might eventually dissolve.

Whether inhibiting A beta production longer than 6 ( or 12) mo may ultimately result in clearance of amyloid is under investigation; unfortunately, the life span of the model eventually limits this experiment.

An additional consideration we recognize is that a small amount of transgene expression continues in the presence of dox and that endogenous mouse A beta continues to be produced.

It is possible that the combined low levels of endogenous mouse A beta and nonsuppressed human peptide are sufficient to maintain existing deposits.	"A beta	64	70	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""A beta"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
It is also clear that in this genetic system, we have raised the production of A beta to levels not found in humans to accelerate pathology into an experimentally feasible time frame.

Somewhat paradoxically, several studies further demonstrate that treatment with anti - inflammatory drugs to reduce microglial activation actually lowers amyloid load in APP transgenic mice, suggesting a role for mouse microglia in the formation and maintenance of amyloid aggregates [ 41 - 43].

Nonetheless, the role of microglia in both the human condition and the mouse models is poorly understood, and differences in microglial reactivity between the two could lead to significantly faster amyloid clearance in the brains of patients with AD than we observe in the tet - off APP mice.

Given the relatively minor role played by microglia in other mouse models of amyloidosis, we think it unlikely that these cells have influenced the rate of amyloid clearance in the tet - off APP mice.

The persistence and stability of amyloid deposits in our system is unexpected given the speed with which A beta aggregates are cleared in other mouse models of therapeutic intervention.

Anti - A beta antibodies injected directly into the brain have been shown to eliminate amyloid deposits in as little as 1 wk after treatment [ 49 - 51].	"A beta	7	13	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""A beta"", ""start_span"": 7, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
More recently, an alternative approach has shown that lentiviral transfer of neprilysin can also reduce the number of aggregates in the area of the injection site [ 54].

However, it has been noted that deletion of the Fc receptor ( the primary receptor for microglial opsinization of antibody - antigen complexes) in APP transgenic mouse models has no impact on the effectiveness of antibody - mediated therapy [ 56, 57].

But in the case of acute antibody - and / or injury - mediated activation, once the inflammation has passed, and the antibody and bound peptide have been cleared and degraded, the remaining A beta quickly reaggregates and amyloid pathology is reestablished [ 49].

Pregnancy - induced remission of CIA in mice appears to be caused by the increase in estrogen levels, while the postpartum exacerbation can be explained by the dramatic drop in estrogen [ 10], possibly together with increased prolactin levels [ 11].

A booster injection containing 50 mu g CII emulsified in 0. 1 M acetic acid combined with an equal amount of Freud ' s incomplete adjuvant ( Difco Laboratories) was given after 30 days.

Since the parental strains differ in susceptibility to CIA, in spite of both having the MHC class II A beta genes [ 15], we wanted to test the susceptibility to inflammatory disease in mice from this cross.

Notably, XpdTTD / + XPCS animals had a partial TTD hair phenotype, correlating with low levels of Xpd + XPCS expression, whereas XpdTTD / XPCS animals had wt hair, correlating with normal expression levels from the viable XpdXPCS allele ( Table 2 and unpublished data).

Secondly, highlighting the potential relevance of current findings to all diploid organisms including humans was the observation that in one compound heterozygous animal, the Xpd allelic relationship could shift from Adominant | arecessive to Arecessive | adominant with respect to different phenotypes in a time - dependent and tissue - specific manner ( see below and Table 2).

In embryonic stem cells, depletion of p150CAF - 1 using RNA interference results in the mislocalization, loss of clustering, and decondensation of pericentric heterochromatin domains.

These alterations of heterochromatin are not found in p150CAF - 1 - depleted mouse embryonic fibroblasts, which are cells that are already lineage committed, suggesting that CAF - 1 is specifically required for heterochromatin organization in pluripotent embryonic cells.	"p150CAF - 1	54	65	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Specifically, CAF - 1 deposits the histone H3 variant H3. 1 into chromatin, in a pathway coupled to DNA synthesis, whereas a second histone chaperone, HIRA, is involved in the deposition of the H3. 3 variant in a DNA synthesis independent pathway [ 11, 12].	"HIRA	151	155	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""HIRA"", ""start_span"": 151, ""end_span"": 155, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In addition to this specific chromatin assembly activity, CAF - 1 interacts with several proteins present in heterochromatin, including heterochromatin protein 1 ( HP1) and MBD1, a methyl - CpG binding domain protein that recruits histone deacetylase and repressive histone methyltransferase activities [ 13 - 15].	"MBD1	173	177	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""MBD1"", ""start_span"": 173, ""end_span"": 177, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Furthermore, p150CAF - 1 is required to ensure a replication - specific pool of HP1 molecules at replication sites in pericentric heterochromatin during mid - late S phase [ 16].	"p150CAF - 1	13	24	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Chaf1a + / - mice were born at a Mendelian frequency, were of normal size and weight, displayed no obvious abnormalities, and were fertile.	"Chaf1a	0	6	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Chaf1a"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 6, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

Furthermore, no homozygous Chaf1a - / - embryos were detected at any of the post - implantation stages.	"Chaf1a	27	33	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Chaf1a"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, we could detect Chaf1a - / - embryos at embryonic day 4 ( E4) using a PCR strategy ( Figure 1B).	"Chaf1a	25	31	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Chaf1a"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
They represent only 10% of E4 embryos obtained from Chaf1a + / - mice intercrosses, suggesting that more than half of the homozygous mutant embryos had degenerated before this stage.

Further analysis by light microscopy using immunofluorescence ( IF) allowed us to compare wild - type and p150CAF - 1 - depleted embryos.	"p150CAF - 1	106	117	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
A loss of p150CAF - 1 staining could not be detected before the eight - cell stage ( unpublished data) suggesting that maternally contributed protein is present in the embryo up to the four - cell stage.	"p150CAF - 1	10	21	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, depletion of p150CAF - 1 protein from this stage allows a maximum of two additional cell divisions before developmental arrest.	"p150CAF - 1	19	30	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Strikingly, we found that the nuclear organization of heterochromatin appeared abnormal in the nuclei of Chaf1a - / - embryos.	"Chaf1a	105	111	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Chaf1a"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Pericentric heterochromatin, the major component of constitutive heterochromatin, can easily be visualized in interphase nuclei by the fluorochrome DAPI and by immunostaining with HP1 alpha [ 16, 17 - 19].	"HP1 alpha	180	189	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""HP1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 180, ""end_span"": 189, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
These structures were not detected in Chaf1a - / - embryos ( Figure 1D).	"Chaf1a	38	44	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Chaf1a"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Localization of HP1 alpha confirmed that the structures visualized by DAPI staining correspond to constitutive heterochromatin ( Figure 1E).	"HP1 alpha	16	25	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""HP1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In Chaf1a - / - E4 embryos, which are arrested between the eight - and 16 - cell stage, DAPI - dense foci were barely detectable ( Figure 1D).	"Chaf1a	3	9	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Chaf1a"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Localization of HP1 alpha showed a diffuse pattern similar to the DAPI, with some enrichment at the nuclear periphery, and around the nucleoli ( Figure 1D).	"HP1 alpha	16	25	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""HP1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This abnormal organization of heterochromatin in Chaf1a - / - embryos is reminiscent of the heterochromatin organization found in two - to four - cell stage wild - type embryos ( compare Figure 1D and 1F).	"Chaf1a	49	55	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Chaf1a"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
These data evidence a key role for p150CAF - 1 during pre - implantation development, and reveal that this protein is required for the proper 3 - D organization of heterochromatin within embryonic cell nuclei.	"p150CAF - 1	35	46	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Given the early developmental arrest observed in Chaf1a - / - embryos, such cells could not be derived directly from null embryos, and we thus used an RNAi strategy ( Figure 2A).	"Chaf1a	49	55	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Chaf1a"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
p150CAF - 1 knockdown in ES cells was quantified by Western blot analysis and IF.	"p150CAF - 1	0	11	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
DAPI - dense foci were lost, and we observed diffuse HP1 alpha and DAPI staining around the nucleoli and at the periphery of the nucleus ( Figure 2B).	"HP1 alpha	53	62	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""HP1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This result indicates that p150CAF - 1 is essential for nuclear organization of heterochromatin in ES cells in a similar way to early pre - implantation embryos.	"p150CAF - 1	27	38	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Surprisingly, we did not observe this severe alteration in heterochromatin organization in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs) following p150CAF - 1 depletion by RNAi.	"p150CAF - 1	145	156	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
p150CAF - 1 depletion in MEFs resulted in a strong inhibition of cell proliferation ( unpublished data), but did not alter the clustering of heterochromatin domains ( Figures 2C and S2).	"p150CAF - 1	0	11	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Similarly, p150CAF - 1 depletion in 3T3 cells did not affect heterochromatin organization [ 16].	"p150CAF - 1	11	22	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We also wondered whether loss of p150CAF - 1 in ES cells specifically affects the heterochromatin nuclear subcompartment, or whether it might result in a more global loss of nuclear organization and architecture.	"p150CAF - 1	33	44	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In addition, Western blot analysis revealed that CAF - 1 depletion did not result in altered levels of chromatin architectural proteins such as histone H3 and HP1 alpha ( Figure S1).	"HP1 alpha	159	168	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""HP1 alpha"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 168, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, 24 h later, ES cells cease to proliferate and die, revealing that p150CAF - 1 is required for an essential cellular process, as in embryos.	"p150CAF - 1	75	86	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Altogether, our data demonstrate that loss of p150CAF - 1 function in ES cells and early embryos alters first the organization of heterochromatin in the nucleus and, in a subsequent step, cell cycle and viability.	"p150CAF - 1	46	57	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In p150CAF - 1 RNAi - depleted cells, we observed a disruption of pericentric heterochromatin clusters that coincides with the disappearance of DAPI - dense foci ( Figure 4B).	"p150CAF - 1	3	14	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Such aggregates, which are often found at the nuclear periphery, are also revealed by DAPI staining as a typical signature of p150CAF - 1 loss - of - function.	"p150CAF - 1	126	137	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Quantification of fluorescence along a line randomly drawn across the nucleus revealed lower fluorescence intensity and a broader distribution of DAPI and major satellite hybridization signals in p150CAF - 1 - depleted cells ( Figure 4C and 4D), indicating decondensation of pericentric heterochromatin domains.	"p150CAF - 1	196	207	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 196, ""end_span"": 207, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In contrast, centric domains showed an intensity and shape similar to control cells, suggesting that they remain unaffected by p150CAF - 1 depletion ( Figure 4C and 4D).	"p150CAF - 1	127	138	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In conclusion, these results show that p150CAF - 1 is required for the proper condensation and clustering of pericentric heterochromatin domains.	"p150CAF - 1	39	50	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In a second series of experiments, we compared the association of histone H3 with chromatin in nuclei isolated from cells transfected with control and p150CAF - 1 RNAi plasmid vectors.	"p150CAF - 1	151	162	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 151, ""end_span"": 162, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In all conditions, the amount of histone H3 remaining associated with chromatin was indistinguishable in control and p150CAF - 1 - depleted ES cells ( unpublished data).	"p150CAF - 1	117	128	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We first tested DNA CpG methylation [ 25] at major satellite repeats and found no significant difference between control and p150CAF - 1 - depleted cells ( Figure 6).	"p150CAF - 1	125	136	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We found that pericentric DNA was immunoprecipitated with a 2 - fold lower efficiency with H4K20me3 [ 29, 30] antibodies following p150CAF - 1 depletion ( Figure 7A and 7B).	"p150CAF - 1	131	142	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Immunoprecipitation of minor satellite repeats in the same experiment was less affected ( Figure 7B), showing that loss of p150CAF - 1 function mainly affects H4K20me3 at pericentric heterochromatin.	"p150CAF - 1	123	134	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
This result shows that p150CAF - 1 contributes to normal levels of H4K20me3 at pericentric heterochromatin, but not necessarily at other loci.	"p150CAF - 1	23	34	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
The H3K9me3 mark [ 32] was also significantly reduced in p150CAF - 1 - depleted cells, though to a lesser extent than H4K20me3 ( Figure 7A and 7B).	"p150CAF - 1	57	68	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Here, we provide evidence that p150CAF - 1 has a crucial function during mouse early embryogenesis and in ES cells.	"p150CAF - 1	31	42	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
In Xenopus laevis, p150CAF - 1 function is required for the rapid cell divisions that occur during early development [ 33].	"p150CAF - 1	19	30	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
We show that in p150CAF - 1 - depleted ES cells, while DNA replication initially persists without significant perturbation in nucleosomal organization, severe heterochromatin organization defects can be observed.	"p150CAF - 1	16	27	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Ultimately, p150CAF - 1 depletion results in the arrest of ES cell division and cell death.	"p150CAF - 1	12	23	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""p150CAF - 1"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
While this has to be addressed experimentally, it is worthwhile to mention an alternate possible mechanism that might explain the disruption of heterochromatin domains in p150CAF - 1 null embryos and ES cells.

Following one or two rounds of DNA replication in the absence of p150CAF - 1, heterochromatin would become deprived of this molecule, which would cause the disruption of its 3 - D organization.

Indeed, we show that abnormalities in both differentiation and light - evoked electrophysiological responses in Rb - deficient retinal cells are rescued when ectopic division and apoptosis are blocked specifically by deleting E2f transcription factor ( E2f) 1.

E2f3b, like repressive E2fs, is present in both quiescent and dividing cells, and in quiescent fibroblasts it associates primarily with Rb, suggesting that it mediates repression [ 16 - 18].

Analysis with the pan - E2f3 antibody ( sc - 878, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) detected a 55 - kD E2f3a species and a 40 - kD E2f3b polypeptide ( Figure 6).	"E2f3	24	28	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""E2f3"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
To confirm that the upper species in our retinal lysates was E2f3a, we exploited novel mice that lack E2f3 exon 1a and thus express E2f3b exclusively ( R. O. and G. L., unpublished data).

Unexpectedly, however, E2f3a deletion suppressed the Rb KO SAC defect ( Figure 7D).	"Rb	53	55	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Thus, separate from its role in cell cycle control, Rb regulation of E2f3a is critical to ensure proper neuronal differentiation.	"Rb	52	54	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Work in the early 1990s showed that Rb loss triggers defects in neuronal cell cycle exit, survival, and differentiation [ 26 - 28].	"Rb	36	38	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, targeted KO and chimeric studies reveal that Rb autonomously promotes cell cycle exit in newborn neurons, and is required for survival of a subset of neurons, particularly in the retina [ 2, 3, 13, 14, 56 - 59].	"Rb	54	56	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, whether Rb also regulates differentiation is obscured by potentially indirect effects of ectopic division and death.	"Rb	17	19	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Moreover, a mechanism though which Rb may regulate neuronal maturation has not been elucidated.	"Rb	35	37	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
E2f1 may also regulate differentiation targets, but whether this contributes to defects in retinal cell maturation is impossible to separate from potentially indirect consequences of deregulated division and death.

In any case, it is clear that in most retinal cells, including photoreceptors [ 29], transcription factors that promote differentiation function independently of Rb.	"Rb	162	164	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 162, ""end_span"": 164, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

Instead, we observed E2f1 - independent defects in the synthesis and transport of a large cohort of SAC proteins.	"E2f1	21	25	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""E2f1"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
These data expand insight into the development of these important interneurons, but more critically, provide to our knowledge the first unambiguous evidence that Rb regulates neurogenesis beyond terminal mitosis.

Rb binds more than 100 factors [ 43], and in several non - neuronal cells, such as skeletal muscle, adipocytes, and bone, it binds and potentiates tissue - specific transcription factors that promote differentiation [ 31 - 33].

Rb does not appear to temper RPC expansion and is not required for differentiation of RPCs into RTCs, but is essential to couple RTC birth to terminal mitosis, thus locking them out of cycle.

Rb is also required for SAC differentiation, and in this case, acts by inhibiting E2f3a.	"Rb	0	2	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 2, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

E2f3b was the primary candidate, since Rb and E2f3b collaborate to repress targets in quiescent cells in vitro [ 19].	"Rb	39	41	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
However, in the first work to our knowledge to examine the function of any E2f protein isoform in vivo, we made the surprising observation that Rb regulates SAC differentiation through E2f3a ( Figure 8).	"Rb	144	146	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
E2f3a and E2f3b share 110 C - terminal amino acids that encode the NLS, DNA - binding, marked box, transactivation, and Rb - binding domains [ 16], yet they exhibit different subcellular distribution in developing retinal cells.

However, even E2f3b, which lacks this domain, binds and is regulated by Ccna2 [ 18], so the domain difference may not explain the unique distributions we observed.	"Ccna2	72	77	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Ccna2"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"

Rb is critical to ensure that many types of terminally differentiating cells leave the cell cycle ( e. g., neurons, gut and skin epithelia, muscle, and lens fibres) ( reviewed in [ 66]).

Early overexpression studies in vitro suggested Rb might temper expansion of cycling cells, but KO studies in vivo indicate that its major role is to block division in terminally differentiating cells.

In the retina, differentiating transition cells are born in the absence of Rb, migrate to the correct layer, and express appropriate markers ( [ 2] and this work).	"Rb	75	77	Gene_or_geneproduct"	"[{""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Gene_or_geneproduct""}]"
Both scenarios are feasible since E2fs regulate differentiation genes [ 44 - 48], and cell cycle regulators, such as Cdkn1b, have cytoplasmic activities that influence differentiation [ 68, 69].
