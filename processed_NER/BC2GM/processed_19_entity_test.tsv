Our results separate these factors into four regulatory classes: ( i) constitutive factors, such as Oct - 1 and probably Sp1, that are expressed in thymocytes at all stages; ( ii) inducible factors, such as NF - kappa B and complexes binding to the region of a CD28 response element, that can be activated in all thymocytes, including those cells ( CD4 + CD8 + TcRlow) that can undergo selection; ( iii) inducible factors, such as NF - AT and AP - 1, that can be activated in mature ( CD4 + CD8 - TcRhigh) and immature ( CD4 - CD8 - TcR -) thymocytes alike but not in the transitional stages when the cells ( CD4 + CD8 + TcRlow) are subject to selection; and ( iv) a factor containing CREB, which can be activated in thymocytes of all developmental stages by culture but does not require specific induction.
