Here we show that PKC and p44 / p42MAPK signalings are required for the HBx - induced Sp1 - mediated IGF - II P4 transcriptional activity since ( i) PKC activation by PMA or PKC expression vector increases Sp1 phosphorylation and P4 activity in HBx - transfected HepG2 cells; ( ii) PKC inhibition by PKC inhibitor Go6976 reduces Sp1 phosphorylation, P4 activity, and IGF - II mRNA in HBx - transfected HepG2 cells; and ( iii) the inhibition of MEK activation by U0126 reduces Sp1 phosphorylation, P4 activity and IGF - II mRNA in HBx - transfected HepG2 cells.
