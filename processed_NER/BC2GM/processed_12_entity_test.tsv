Genetic analysis places CWH43 upstream of the BCK2 branch of the PKC1 signalling pathway, since cwh43 mutations were synthetic lethal with pkc1 deletion, whereas the cwh43 defects could be rescued by overexpression of BCK2 and not by high - copy - number expression of genes encoding downstream proteins of the PKC1 pathway However, unlike BCK2, whose disruption in a cln3 mutant resulted in growth arrest in G ( 1), no growth defect was observed in a double cwh43 cln3 mutants.
