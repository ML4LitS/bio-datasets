Thus, these studies on rat Std promoter function indicate that ( i) HNF1 and C / EBP are responsible for liver specificity of the rat Std gene; ( ii) androgenic repression of the gene requires the presence of all of the OCT - 1 and C / EBP elements between positions - 231 and - 292; and ( iii) AR may exert its negative regulatory effect indirectly through transcriptional interference of OCT - 1 and C / EBP rather than through a direct DNA - AR interaction.	rat Std promoter,23,39,Gene/Protein	HNF1,68,72,Gene/Protein	C / EBP,77,84,Gene/Protein	rat Std gene,130,142,Gene/Protein	OCT - 1,220,227,Gene/Protein	C / EBP elements,232,248,Gene/Protein	AR,295,297,Gene/Protein	OCT - 1,390,397,Gene/Protein	C / EBP,402,409,Gene/Protein	DNA - AR,439,447,Gene/Protein	"[{""token"": ""rat Std promoter"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""HNF1"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""C / EBP"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""rat Std gene"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""OCT - 1"", ""start_span"": 220, ""end_span"": 227, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""C / EBP elements"", ""start_span"": 232, ""end_span"": 248, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""AR"", ""start_span"": 295, ""end_span"": 297, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""OCT - 1"", ""start_span"": 390, ""end_span"": 397, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""C / EBP"", ""start_span"": 402, ""end_span"": 409, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""DNA - AR"", ""start_span"": 439, ""end_span"": 447, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"	train
