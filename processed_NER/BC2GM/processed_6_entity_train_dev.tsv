The recognition specificity of the p55 PDZ domain appears to be unique, since the three PDZ domains of hDlg ( human lymphocyte homologue of the Drosophila discs large tumor suppressor) do not bind the cytoplasmic domain of glycophorin C.

These data further define a role for TRADD and TRAF2 in JNK activation and confirm that LMP1 utilizes signalling mechanisms used by the TNF receptor / CD40 family to elicit its pleiotropic activities.

CONCLUSIONS: XCoe2 may play a pivotal role in the transcriptional cascade that specifies primary neurons in Xenopus embryos: by maintaining Delta - Notch signalling, XCoe2 stabilises the higher neural potential of selected progenitor cells that express X - ngnr - 1, ensuring the transition between neural competence and irreversible commitment to a neural fate; and it promotes neuronal differentiation by activating XNeuroD expression, directly or indirectly.
