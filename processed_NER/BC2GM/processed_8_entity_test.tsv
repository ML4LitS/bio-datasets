In vitro death assays with transient overexpression of deletion constructs of both isoforms using beta - galactosidase as a reporter gene in MCF7 cells suggest the following: 1) the nucleotide binding domain may act as a negative regulator of the killing activity of DEFCAP; 2) the LRR / CARD represents a putative constitutively active inducer of apoptosis; 3) the killing activity of LRR / CARD is inhibitable by benzyloxycarbonyl - Val - Ala - Asp ( OMe) - fluoromethyl ketone and to a lesser extent by Asp - Glu - Val - Asp ( OMe) - fluoromethyl ketone; and 4) the CARD is critical for killing activity of DEFCAP.
