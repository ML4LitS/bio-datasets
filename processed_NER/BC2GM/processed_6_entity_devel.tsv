Altogether these results suggest that, in KG1a cells, TNFalpha can stimulate in parallel PC - PLC and PLD, whose lipid products activate in turn mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAP kinase) and NF - kappaB signalling respectively.

We further demonstrate that the Stress - Activated - Protein - Kinase ( SAPK) target sites of ATF2, Thr69 and Thr71 are not required for the formation of the p300 / CBP - ATF2 multiprotein complex.

Our results indicate that the minimal requirements for induction of PEPCK by PKA and inhibition by insulin include: 1) the CREB activation domain, 2) the PEPCK TATA sequence, and 3) insulin - responsive hepatoma cells.

The recognition specificity of the p55 PDZ domain appears to be unique, since the three PDZ domains of hDlg ( human lymphocyte homologue of the Drosophila discs large tumor suppressor) do not bind the cytoplasmic domain of glycophorin C.

These data further define a role for TRADD and TRAF2 in JNK activation and confirm that LMP1 utilizes signalling mechanisms used by the TNF receptor / CD40 family to elicit its pleiotropic activities.

CONCLUSIONS: XCoe2 may play a pivotal role in the transcriptional cascade that specifies primary neurons in Xenopus embryos: by maintaining Delta - Notch signalling, XCoe2 stabilises the higher neural potential of selected progenitor cells that express X - ngnr - 1, ensuring the transition between neural competence and irreversible commitment to a neural fate; and it promotes neuronal differentiation by activating XNeuroD expression, directly or indirectly.
