The binding of transcription factor AP - 1 and vitamin D receptor ( VDR) to the composite AP - 1 plus vitamin - D - responsive promoter region ( AP - 1 + VDRE) of the human osteocalcin gene was characterized in osteocalcin - producing ( MG - 63) and non - producing ( U2 - Os, SaOs - 2) human osteosarcoma cell lines.

Furthermore, deletion and mutation analyses of the VCAM - 1 promoter performed with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs revealed that Tax was trans activating the VCAM - 1 promoter via two NF - kappaB sites present at bp - 72 and - 57 in the VCAM - 1 gene promoter, with both of them being required for the Tax - induced expression of this adhesion molecule.
