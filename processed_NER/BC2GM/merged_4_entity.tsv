Deletion analysis of rOC promoter - chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs demonstrates that an AML - 1 - binding sequence within the proximal promoter ( - 138 to - 130 nt) contributes to 75% of the level of osteocalcin gene expression.	rOC promoter,21,33,Gene/Protein	chloramphenicol acetyltransferase,36,69,Gene/Protein	AML - 1 - binding sequence,102,128,Gene/Protein	osteocalcin gene,214,230,Gene/Protein	"[{""token"": ""rOC promoter"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""chloramphenicol acetyltransferase"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""AML - 1 - binding sequence"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""osteocalcin gene"", ""start_span"": 214, ""end_span"": 230, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"	train
In addition, a noncanonical C / EBP - binding site within the Gadd45gamma promoter where C / EBPbeta and C / EBPdelta could bind, was identified by electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA) and reporter gene analysis.

These results suggest that, for the HML ARS cluster ( ARS303, ARS320, and ARS302), inactivity of origins is independent of local transcriptional silencing, even though origins and silencers share key cis - and trans - acting components.

Since the UfAP and UTMP share many biosynthetic and structural features that include site of biosynthesis in the endometrium, P4 - responsiveness, the presence of the mannose 6 - phosphate lysosomal recognition marker, and considerable sequence similarity, the UfAP and the UTMP may have homologous function which for both still remains obscure.
