Although this observation contradicts earlier studies on swarming in E. coli and S. enterica [ 29], more recent work has shown that chemotaxis mutants are capable of surface motility when the surface of the agar is sprayed with a fine mist of water [ 30], or when the agar concentration of the swarming media is reduced from 0. 6% to 0. 45% [ 31].

The Rcs pathway consists of a phosphotransfer protein ( RcsD) that mediates phosphate transfer from a sensor kinase ( RcsC) to a response regulator ( RcsB) that binds DNA with an accessory protein ( RcsA).

Based on sequence homology, YhjH, YfgF, and YegE belong to the newly identified and highly prevalent family of proteins that function in the turnover of bis - ( 3 ' - 5 ') - cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate ( c - di - GMP), which is a second messenger involved in the regulation of a wide variety of bacterial behaviors [ 49].	"c - di - GMP	215	227	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""c - di - GMP"", ""start_span"": 215, ""end_span"": 227, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Synthesis of c - di - GMP is catalyzed by diguanylate cyclases ( DGC) and its degradation is regulated by phosphodiesterases ( PDE).	"c - di - GMP	13	25	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""c - di - GMP"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
YhjH contains an EAL domain, and expression of this protein leads to the degradation of c - di - GMP and enhanced motility in S. enterica [ 52].	"c - di - GMP	88	100	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""c - di - GMP"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Based on the known antagonistic effects of c - di - GMP on motility [ 52] and by following several lines of reasoning, we hypothesized the dominant enzymatic activities of the GGDEF and EAL domains in YfgF and YegE.	"c - di - GMP	43	55	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""c - di - GMP"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Based on these observations, we propose that deleting yegE and over - expressing yfgF suppress the motility defect of the DeltayhjH strain by reducing the intracellular levels of c - di - GMP ( Figure 7).	"c - di - GMP	179	191	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""c - di - GMP"", ""start_span"": 179, ""end_span"": 191, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
If c - di - GMP levels act globally and can influence motility, then insertions in many of the genes containing active GGDEF domains should rescue motility in the DeltayhjH double mutant library.	"c - di - GMP	3	15	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""c - di - GMP"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Alternatively, specificity in c - di - GMP signaling may be due to a number of mechanisms including spatial and temporal sequestration, microcompartmentalization, restricted production / degradation, or target modification [ 56].

The manner in which c - di - GMP alters motility at the molecular level is currently unknown.	"c - di - GMP	20	32	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""c - di - GMP"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
However, it has been reported that c - di - GMP binds to the PilZ domain of the aforementioned YcgR protein [ 48].	"c - di - GMP	35	47	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""c - di - GMP"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
In addition to its effects on swimming, we found evidence that c - di - GMP signaling also plays a role in swarming motility.	"c - di - GMP	63	75	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""c - di - GMP"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Mutations in ycgR were also found to suppress the swarming defect of the DeltayfiR strain ( unpublished data), suggesting that YcgR binds c - di - GMP to affect both swimming and swarming motility.	"c - di - GMP	138	150	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""c - di - GMP"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
The observations that the DeltayhjH mutant is impaired in swimming but indistinguishable from the wild - type strain in swarming, while in contrast the DeltayfiR strain cannot swarm and is only mildly impaired in swimming, support the notion that c - di - GMP signaling pathways are temporally and / or spatially separated, as recently suggested by others [ 58, 59].
