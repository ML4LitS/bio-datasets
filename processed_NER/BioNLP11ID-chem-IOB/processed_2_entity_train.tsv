Single crossover between one flanking fragment in pGRV - DeltavicK and the homologous region in the genome would lead to the insertion of the whole plasmid into S. equi genome, resulting in strains resistant to both spectinomycin and chloramphenicol.

Biochemical analysis of purified Rv2623 suggested that this mycobacterial USP binds ATP, and the 2. 9 - A - resolution crystal structure revealed that Rv2623 engages ATP in a novel nucleotide - binding pocket.

Together, the results indicate that i) M. tuberculosis Rv2623 regulates mycobacterial growth in vitro and in vivo, and ii) Rv2623 is required for the entry of the tubercle bacillus into the chronic phase of infection in the host; in addition, iii) Rv2623 binds ATP; and iv) the growth - regulatory attribute of this USP is dependent on its ATP - binding activity.

Nitric oxide ( NO) produced by infected macrophages and relative hypoxia are signals likely to be encountered within tuberculous lesions that are believed, based on in vitro studies, to promote latency by prompting the M. tuberculosis dormancy response.

The present study reveals that: i) deletion of rv2623 confers hypervirulence on the tubercle bacillus in animal models, suggesting that expression of Rv2623 may be conducive to the establishment of persistence in vivo; ii) overexpression of Rv2623 results in growth retardation of recipient strains in vitro, further supporting a growth - regulatory role; iii) Rv2623 binds ATP; and finally, through mutagenesis study guided by crystallographic analysis of Rv2623 ( the first such study for a tandem - domain USP), we show that iv) the growth - regulating attribute of this M. tuberculosis USP is linked to its ATP - binding capacity.

An HPLC - based examination of supernatants from boiled samples of His6 - Rv2623 demonstrated that His6 - Rv2623 co - purifies with both ATP and ADP ( Figure 5).

Analysis of E. coli - expressed Rv2623 using nano ESI mass spectrometry also demonstrated that an ATP - saturated form of dimeric Rv2623 ( composed of 2 bound ATP molecules per monomer) constitutes at least half of the purified sample ( data not shown).

Measurement of the binding stoichiometry, which comprised HPLC - based quantification of adenine nucleotides from the boiled supernatant and spectral analysis of heat denatured Rv2623 following reconstitution in 6 M guanidine - HCl, yields 1. 4 + / - 0. 2 nucleotide equivalents / monomer with an overall content of 86 + / - 4% ATP ( 14 + / - 4% ADP).

Structure - based sequence alignments of both Rv2623 domains with the N631 consensus suggest that domain 2, which exhibits significantly higher conservation than domain 1 across global and ATP - binding subfamily consensus sequences, represents the ancestral domain among ATP - binding USPs with tandem - type architectures.

To explore the relationship between the putative ATP - dependent biochemical function of Rv2623 and the growth - regulating attribute of Rv2623, we engineered mutations within the L1 ( D15E) and beta4 ( G117A) conserved residues that were predicted, on the basis of the crystal structure, to disrupt ATP recognition ( Figure 7A).	"ATP	49	52	Chemical"	"ATP	300	303	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""ATP"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""ATP"", ""start_span"": 300, ""end_span"": 303, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
HPLC analysis of nucleotides extracted from Rv2623D15E and Rv2623G117A revealed that the mutant proteins are indeed deficient in ATP - binding, exhibiting approximately34% ( p < 0. 001) and approximately29% ( p = 0. 0018) of the amount of ATP bound by wild - type Rv2623, respectively ( Figure 7B).	"ATP	129	132	Chemical"	"ATP	239	242	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""ATP"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""ATP"", ""start_span"": 239, ""end_span"": 242, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Likewise, following an overnight incubation with [ alpha - 33P] ATP at 4degreesC, the amount of protein - bound radioactivity, which represented a very small fraction of the total ATP binding sites, was significantly less for the mutant proteins than wild - type Rv2623 ( data not shown).

It is therefore likely that the D15E and G117A mutations produced local structural changes in the ATP binding loops that contributed directly to the reduced levels of bound ATP in comparing to wild - type Rv2623.

The distinct effects exhibited by the wild type and the G117A and D15E mutants defective in ATP binding suggests a direct correlation between growth attenuation and ATP binding ( Figure 7B).

While the non - ATP - binding UspA homologs appear to play diverse roles in promoting survival under a variety of environmental insults [ 15], [ 49], [ 50], [ 51], the function ( s) of ATP - binding type USPs remain unclear [ 9].

Based on in silico analyses, Florczyk et al. classified Rv2623 as belonging to a novel class of ATPases [ 52], although formal evidence for ATP binding by this protein has not been reported.

It has been proposed that a nucleotide - binding USP from M. jannaschii, MJ0577, whose ability to hydrolyze ATP is dependent on interaction with factor ( s) present in the cell extract of this hyperthermophile [ 26], functions as a molecular switch much like the Ras protein family, whose GTP hydrolysis ability is modulated by interaction with a number of regulatory proteins [ 53], [ 54], [ 55].

It is therefore conceivable that M. tuberculosis Rv2623, as a component of the yet - to - be defined dormancy signaling pathway ( s), functions as a molecular switch by virtue of its ATP - binding and putative ATP - hydrolyzing properties, to mediate the establishment of tuberculous latency.

Elucidation of how ATP - binding and, potentially, the hydrolysis of ATP by Rv2623 regulate M. tuberculosis dormancy - signaling pathways will likely illuminate the mechanisms by which the tubercle bacillus establishes persistence.

Complemented mutant strains, harboring the respective regulator genes under the control of the arabinose - inducible PBAD promoter, were allowed to grow for 144 hr in flow cells to maturity ( Fig. 2C, Fig. 5 - 0 hr) in the presence of arabinose, after which time arabinose was removed from the growth medium to stop the transcription of the respective genes.

Interestingly, both glutamate and GABA are important neurotransmitters at the neuromuscular junction of insects, and the concentration of glutamate is very low in insect hemolymph, suggesting that it is converted to glutamine before it is absorbed [ 14].

Acquisition of pentoses from the environment may be important because Y. pestis does not possess glucose 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase activity, the first step of the pentose phosphate pathway [ 19].
