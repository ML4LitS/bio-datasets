Among the loci exhibiting high z - scores after chi - phage selection were the rfa and mdo gene clusters responsible for the structural assembly of lipopolysaccharides ( LPS) and osmoregulated periplasmic glucans ( OPG).

To determine the role of the Rcs signaling pathway in LPS / OPG mediated repression of motility, we disrupted each of the components of the Rcs system in most of our LPS and OPG mutants.

Both OPG and LPS mutants showed decreased sensitivity to chi - phage, and the decrease in sensitivity was eliminated by introducing DeltarcsF deletions, indicating that OPG and LPS are not directly required for chi - phage infection ( Figures 5B - D).

In P. temperata, pchC, a gene involved in the biogenesis of pyochelin type of siderophore [ 61], was upregulated indicating the importance of iron, whereas a siderophore - independent zinc ion transport system encoded by gene znuA [ 62] was induced in X. koppenhoeferi indicating the importance of zinc.

Finally, the last gene that was up - regulated in our study and identified in another in vivo study is nanE, which codes for a putative N - acetylmannosamine - 6 - phosphate 2 - epimerase, an enzyme involved in the use of N - acetylneuraminate and N - acetylmannosamine as carbon sources [ 35].

In bacteria, Fur down - regulates the transcription of genes involved in iron - acquisition and iron homeostasis in bacterial cells, and its action is directly linked to the amount of available iron, as it requires Fe2 + as a cofactor [ 41].
