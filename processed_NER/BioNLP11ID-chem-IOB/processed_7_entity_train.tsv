Consistent with previous results reporting on the antibiotic resistance phenotype of bacterial biofilms [ 6], [ 19], the MBEC values of biofilms cultivated in magnesium - replete conditions and treated with CAPs ( polymyxin B, colistin) or aminoglycosides ( gentamycin, tobramycin) were up to 64 - fold higher than the MIC values of planktonic cultures ( Table 1).
