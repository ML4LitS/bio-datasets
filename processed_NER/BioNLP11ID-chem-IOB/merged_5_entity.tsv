While Y. enterocolitica explores citrate for anaerobic metabolism, it is most likely that the specific uptake of citrate and other tricarboxylic acids by TctCBA is used by P. luminescens upon entering the insect host where enough citrate is available.	citrate,33,40,Chemical	citrate,113,120,Chemical	tricarboxylic acids,131,150,Chemical	TctCBA,154,160,Chemical	citrate,230,237,Chemical	"[{""token"": ""citrate"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""citrate"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""tricarboxylic acids"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""TctCBA"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 160, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""citrate"", ""start_span"": 230, ""end_span"": 237, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"	train
Under limiting Mg2 + conditions, the addition of excess Mg2 +, Ca2 + or Mn2 +, but not Zn2 +, repressed PA3553 expression ( Fig 7B).

On the other hand, although mild acid ( pH 6. 0) per se, i. e. even in the presence of high Mg2 +, promotes LPS modifications ( Gibbons et al., 2005), the low pH signal may also act synergistically with the low Mg2 + signal in vivo because Mg2 + deprivation alone is not sufficient to provide all the LPS modifications seen in Salmonella when present inside macrophages ( Gibbons et al., 2005).

The glutathione synthetase gene gshB which mediates condensation of gamma - glutamylcysteine and glycine to form glutathione [ 47, 48] was induced in P. temperata, but glutathione reductase gene gor which reduces glutathione disulfide to the sulfhydryl form of glutathione [ 47, 48] was induced in X. koppenhoeferi.	glutathione,4,15,Chemical	glutathione,113,124,Chemical	glutathione,168,179,Chemical	glutathione disulfide,213,234,Chemical	glutathione,261,272,Chemical	"[{""token"": ""glutathione"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""glutathione"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""glutathione"", ""start_span"": 168, ""end_span"": 179, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""glutathione disulfide"", ""start_span"": 213, ""end_span"": 234, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""glutathione"", ""start_span"": 261, ""end_span"": 272, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"	test
For example, AP bacteria grew better than WT bacteria in the presence of N - acetyl - neuraminic acid, and were more sensitive to four antimicrobials ( out of 373 screened in PM), including the calcium - specific metal chelator EGTA, the lipophilic chelator 5 - chloro - 7 - iodo - 8 - hydroxyquinoline, and the antibiotics tobramycin and cefotaxime ( Table 1).
