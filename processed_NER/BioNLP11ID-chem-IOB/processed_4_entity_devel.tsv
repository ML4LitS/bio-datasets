We determined that Chelex 100 was effective at chelating iron because expression of the pmrA - independent iron - repressed iroA gene ( Hall and Foster, 1996) was induced to higher levels in cultures treated with Chelex 100 ( Fig. 2D).

The effects of various carbon sources on the expression of hilE and hilD were studied with two Mlc regulon - inducing sugars, glucose and mannose, and two Mlc regulon - non - inducing carbohydrates, arabinose and glycerol.

The glucose present in DLB ( LB broth diluted 1: 5) decreased hilA expression 2. 5 - fold, as compared to DLB without glucose, while lactose and arabinose had little effect on hilA expression ( 45).
