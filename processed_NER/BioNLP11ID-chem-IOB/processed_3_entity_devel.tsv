The PmrA protein and its cognate sensor kinase PmrB form a two - component regulatory system that is required for virulence in mice ( Gunn et al., 2000), infection of chicken macrophages ( Zhao et al., 2002), growth in soil ( Chamnongpol et al., 2002), resistance to the cationic peptide antibiotic polymyxin B ( Roland et al., 1993) and resistance to Fe3 + - ( Wosten et al., 2000) and Al3 + - mediated killing ( Nishino et al., 2006).

The PmrA - regulated products characterized thus far mediate modifications to the various components of the lipopolysacharide ( LPS) structure including the lipid A ( Gunn et al., 1998; Trent et al., 2001; Zhou et al., 2001; Breazeale et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2004), the core region ( Nishino et al., 2006) and the O - antigen ( Delgado et al., 2006).

Besides mild acid pH, two other stimuli are known to promote expression of PmrA - activated genes: ( i) submillimolar levels of extracellular Fe3 + or Al3 +, which are directly sensed by the PmrB protein ( Wosten et al., 2000), and ( ii) low concentrations of extracellular Mg2 + ( Soncini and Groisman, 1996) ( Fig. 1).

This medium lacked Fe3 + or Al3 +, the only known PmrB ligands ( Wosten et al., 2000), and contained 10 mM MgCl2, which represses expression of PmrA - activated genes ( Soncini and Groisman, 1996; Kox et al., 2000).

Expression of pbgP was still induced when Salmonella was grown in the Chelex - treated medium ( Fig. 2D) or in media containing the specific Fe3 + chelator deferoxamine mesylate ( data not shown) supporting the notion that mild acid pH is responsible for the observed induction.

Interestingly, arabinose also activated hilE, albeit to a lesser degree than either glucose or mannose.

On the other hand, the expression in SR1304 of both hilE and hilD was increased in the presence of glucose, mannose or arabinose.

During the past decades, a series of virulence determinants of SS2 involved in the survival, spread and pathopoiesis of the bacterium within the host have been identified, such as capsule polysaccharide ( CPS), muramidase - related protein ( MRP), suilysin, etc.	"capsule polysaccharide	180	202	Chemical"	"CPS	205	208	Chemical"	"suilysin	248	256	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""capsule polysaccharide"", ""start_span"": 180, ""end_span"": 202, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""CPS"", ""start_span"": 205, ""end_span"": 208, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""suilysin"", ""start_span"": 248, ""end_span"": 256, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
