Here we report that this activation requires both PmrA ' s cognate sensor kinase PmrB, which had been previously shown to respond to Fe3 + and Al3 +, and PmrA ' s post - translational activator PmrD.

The low Mg2 + activation of the PmrA protein requires PhoQ, a protein that senses extracellular Mg2 + levels ( Vescovi et al., 1996), PhoQ ' s cognate regulator PhoP, and the PhoP - activated protein PmrD ( Kox et al., 2000; Kato and Groisman, 2004).

A similar induction of pbgP transcription was found when MES was used as the buffering agent in the media at pH 5. 8 instead of Bis - Tris ( data not shown), indicating that the mild acid effect on gene expression was not due to a particular buffering system.

The PmrB protein is necessary for activation of the PmrA protein in low Mg2 + ( Kox et al., 2000; Kato and Groisman, 2004) and in the presence of Fe3 + ( Wosten et al., 2000), consistent with the notion that PmrB is the major phosphodonor for PmrA.

We considered the possibility of PmrA being phosphorylated from acetyl phosphate because acetyl phosphate has been shown to serve as phosphoryl donor to several response regulators when their cognate sensors are absent ( see Wolfe, 2005 for a review).	"acetyl phosphate	64	80	Chemical"	"acetyl phosphate	89	105	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""acetyl phosphate"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""acetyl phosphate"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
This could be because PmrB is directly involved in sensing extracytoplasmic pH in a way analogous to its sensing of Fe3 + and Al3 + ( Wosten et al., 2000), or because PmrB plays an indirect role in its capacity of main ( if not sole) phosphodonor for PmrA.	"Fe3 +	116	121	Chemical"	"Al3 +	126	131	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Fe3 +"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""Al3 +"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
There was no pbgP expression in cells grown at pH 5. 8 ( Fig. 5B) or in the presence of Fe3 + ( Fig. 5D), which is in contrast to the normal activation in response to low Mg2 + ( Fig. 5C).	"Fe3 +	88	93	Chemical"	"Mg2 +	171	176	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Fe3 +"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""Mg2 +"", ""start_span"": 171, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Together, these results argue in favour of the notion that PmrB senses extracellular pH besides its previously described ligands Fe3 + and Al3 + ( Wosten et al., 2000).	"Fe3 +	129	134	Chemical"	"Al3 +	139	144	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Fe3 +"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""Al3 +"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Second, acid stress can become a severe challenge for bacterial cells when organic acids such as acetate or products of fermentation are present in the medium ( Bearson et al., 1998); and in our experiments we used a non - fermentable sugar ( glycerol) and inorganic acids which are not expected to cause such acid stress.

Although it has been suggested that the Salmonella PhoQ protein senses acid pH ( Aranda et al., 1992) or responds to both pH and Mg2 + ( Bearson et al., 1998), a direct role for PhoQ in responding to acid pH appears unlikely because not all PhoP - regulated genes are activated under these conditions, which is in contrast to low Mg2 + activating the whole PhoP regulon ( see Groisman and Mouslim, 2006 for a review).	"Mg2 +	129	134	Chemical"	"Mg2 +	330	335	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Mg2 +"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""Mg2 +"", ""start_span"": 330, ""end_span"": 335, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
This may be particularly important for Salmonella living in soil due to the fact that the antimicrobial peptide polymyxin B is produced by the soil bacterium Paenibacillus polymyxa ( Paulus and Gray, 1964) and because the solubility of metals such as Fe3 + increases in acid pH.

The specific down - regulation of hilD observed in the presence of Mlc regulon - inducible sugars, such as glucose and mannose, could not be detected in the mlc mutant.

The expression of SPI1 is controlled in response to a specific combination of environmental signals, including pH, oxygen tension, medium osmolarity, bile, Mg2 + concentration, short - chain fatty acids ( SCFAS), and growth stage of the bacteria ( 3, 6).

These genes include those that encode several two - component regulatory systems ( PhoP / Q, PhoBR, OmpR / EnvZ and SirA / BarA), post - transcriptional systems ( CsrAB, RNase E, PNPase and Lon), nucleoid proteins ( HU, FIS, H - NS and Hha), signaling molecules ( ppGpp and NpnN), and other regulatory proteins ( FliZ, FadD and CpxA) ( 6, 7, 19, 21, 22).

The Mlc regulon can be induced by glucose and, to a lesser extent, by mannose ( 39).

In the wild - type strain, glucose and mannose increased hilE expression 2 - fold and hilE activation reduced hilD expression ( Figure 6).

Glucose and mannose induce the Mlc regulon ( 39) by dephosphorylating EIICBGlc, which then sequesters Mlc from its binding sites ( 27, 43).

We observed a 2 - fold activation of hilE and concomitant repression of hilD in the presence of glucose or mannose, which are known inducers of the Mlc regulon, when TB was used ( Figure 6).

In addition, hilE expression was also increased in the presence of arabinose, which suggests an additional regulatory mechanism mediated by arabinose.

The relatively high glucose concentration in the proximal small intestine may repress SPI1 gene expression through Mlc, perhaps together with PhoR - PhoB and / or SirA, whereas upon transit to the distal ileum, the glucose concentration becomes low enough to activate the invasion genes of SPI1.

However, in our study, neither microarray findings nor further analysis of real - time quantitative RT - PCR revealed any differences in level of transcription of the known virulence factors ( CPS, suilysin, MRP and EF) between the wild type and mutant strain.

Prior to this study, SalK / SalR is only known to be associated with the production of a kind of lantibiotic peptide named salivaricin A ( SalA) in S. salivarius [ 11], as yet, this TCSTS has not been linked to the regulation of bacterial virulence.
