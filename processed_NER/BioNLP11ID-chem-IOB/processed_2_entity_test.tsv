Further characterization of these novel genes revealed that they impair motility through diverse mechanisms such as disrupting signaling through phosphorelay cascades, altering concentrations of the recently appreciated cyclic di - GMP ( c - di - GMP) second messenger, and by mechanisms that have yet to be revealed.

Genes involved with the synthesis of LPS and OPG precursors ( hldD, hldE, galU, gmhA, gmhB, and pgm) were also highly abundant after chi - phage selection.	"LPS	37	40	Chemical"	"OPG	45	48	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""LPS"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""OPG"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
These findings suggested that mutations in LPS and OPG biosynthetic genes may compromise motility.

We confirmed this expectation by creating in - frame deletions of nearly all genes involved in LPS and OPG biosynthesis and assaying the mutants for motility.

OPG mutants were defective in both swimming and swarming; surprisingly, however, only mutants with large LPS truncations showed significant defects in these behaviors ( Figures 3E and 4).

In addition, we noticed that LPS mutants varied widely in flhDC expression and that the repression of this operon, and the corresponding motility defect, were related to the degree of LPS truncation ( Figure 4).

The widespread influence of LPS and OPG mutations on swimming, swarming, and chi - phage infection prompted us to explore the genetic mechanism of these mutations in more detail.	"LPS	28	31	Chemical"	"OPG	36	39	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""LPS"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""OPG"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Previous evidence links LPS and OPG mutations to the activation of the Rcs phosphorelay system [ 34, 35], and the Rcs system is known to negatively regulate the flhDC operon [ 36].	"LPS	24	27	Chemical"	"OPG	32	35	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""LPS"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""OPG"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
We found that deletion of rcsB, rcsD, or rcsF was sufficient to rescue motility in both LPS and OPG mutants ( Figure S6), providing strong evidence that perturbations in these structures repress motility by signaling through the Rcs pathway.	"LPS	88	91	Chemical"	"OPG	96	99	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""LPS"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""OPG"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
The chi - phage selection results suggest that LPS and OPG are necessary for infection.

However, since functional flagella are a prerequisite for chi - phage infection, we sought to determine whether defects in LPS and OPG affect chi - phage infection directly or whether the observed selection results are primarily due to reduced flagellar expression.	"LPS	123	126	Chemical"	"OPG	131	134	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""LPS"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""OPG"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
To evaluate the necessity of LPS and OPG for phage infection, we needed mutants that were defective in these structures but still synthesized functional flagella and were motile.	"LPS	29	32	Chemical"	"OPG	37	40	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""LPS"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""OPG"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Therefore, we created double mutants combining an LPS or OPG mutation and a secondary mutation in one of the components of the Rcs signaling pathway.

To test whether such a direct role exists, we interrogated our collection of LPS and OPG mutants for swarming proficiency.

We found that mutants with OPG defects and severe LPS truncations were incapable of swarming and that introducing DeltarcsF deletions into these mutants was sufficient to rescue the phenotype ( Figures 3F and S6).

These data indicate that LPS and OPG are not directly necessary for swarming, and that the behavior exhibited by such mutants results from Rcs - mediated repression of the flhDC operon.

Based on this observation and because EAL domain proteins function in the degradation of c - di - GMP, we hypothesized that the motility defect of DeltayhjH ( Figure 1C) is a result of increased intracellular levels of c - di - GMP.

It is hypothesized that YcgR undergoes a conformational change upon binding to c - di - GMP, and that the YcgR - c - di - GMP complex impairs motility through a protein - protein interaction with the flagellar motor [ 57].

In addition to its virulence, the main reasons for the extensive use of OG1RF as a laboratory strain are that it does not carry plasmids, is readily transformable by electroporation, and is not resistant to commonly used antibiotics, other than rifampicin and fusidic acid.

Also, the OG1RF operon carries two copies of an iolG - like gene, which encodes inositol 2 - dehydrogenase, the first enzyme of the myo - inositol degradation pathway ( Figure 5).

Both mutants failed to ferment myo - inositol ( data not shown), demonstrating that these genes are essential for myo - inositol fermentation.

Mutations in this region have been associated with fusidic acid resistance in Staphylococcus aureus [ 55, 56], and thus the C1368A mutation is likely the cause of the fusidic acid resistance phenotype in OG1RF.
