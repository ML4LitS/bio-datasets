In bacteria, Fur down - regulates the transcription of genes involved in iron - acquisition and iron homeostasis in bacterial cells, and its action is directly linked to the amount of available iron, as it requires Fe2 + as a cofactor [ 41].	iron,73,77,Chemical	iron,96,100,Chemical	iron,194,198,Chemical	Fe2 +,215,220,Chemical	"[{""token"": ""iron"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""iron"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""iron"", ""start_span"": 194, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""Fe2 +"", ""start_span"": 215, ""end_span"": 220, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"	test
