On the other hand, although mild acid ( pH 6. 0) per se, i. e. even in the presence of high Mg2 +, promotes LPS modifications ( Gibbons et al., 2005), the low pH signal may also act synergistically with the low Mg2 + signal in vivo because Mg2 + deprivation alone is not sufficient to provide all the LPS modifications seen in Salmonella when present inside macrophages ( Gibbons et al., 2005).
