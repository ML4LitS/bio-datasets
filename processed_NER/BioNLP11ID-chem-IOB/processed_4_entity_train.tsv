Bacteria use two different strategies to acquire sufficient amounts of iron, namely the expression and secretion of high - affinity iron - binding compounds called siderophores, and the production of receptors for iron carriers such as heme.

In addition, Y. enterocolitica produces two heme - protein acquisition sytems ( YE0123 - 126, YE2180 - 2182), a second SfuABC system, the ferrichrome binding and transport proteins ( YE0730 - 0732), a putative siderophore ( YE0704), and a hemin storage system ( YE2481 - 2484).

Interestingly, three gene loci involved in iron acquisition, namely the genes encoding the hemin storage system, the yersiniabactin and the enterobactin transporter FepG, have been demonstrated to be up - regulated upon temperature decrease in Y. pestis or Y. ruckeri, respectively ( Table 1).

The Na + dependent citrate symporter CitS of S. enterica, which the Y. enterocolitica protein YE2507 is homologous to, is induced by the CitA / CitB system for fermentation of citrate under anoxic conditions [ 110], indicating a general difference of citrate utilization in P. luminescens and Y. enterocolitica.

The use of streptonigrin, an antibiotic whose toxicity correlates with levels of free iron, was based on the observation that the intracellular environment of macrophages can induce a iron - scavenging response in mycobacteria [ 25], perhaps as a means of maintaining adequate levels of this important growth factor, and that an E. coli USP was shown to regulate iron uptake [ 9].
