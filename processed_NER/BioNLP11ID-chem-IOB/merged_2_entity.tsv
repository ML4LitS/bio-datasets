HPLC analysis of nucleotides extracted from Rv2623D15E and Rv2623G117A revealed that the mutant proteins are indeed deficient in ATP - binding, exhibiting approximately34% ( p < 0. 001) and approximately29% ( p = 0. 0018) of the amount of ATP bound by wild - type Rv2623, respectively ( Figure 7B).

The HlyX regulon was characterized recently, and iron - regulated protein B ( FrpB) was identified as a potentially important virulence factor up - regulated when A. pleuropneumoniae is grown in oxygen - deprived environments [ 20].	iron,49,53,Chemical	oxygen,195,201,Chemical	"[{""token"": ""iron"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""oxygen"", ""start_span"": 195, ""end_span"": 201, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"	test
A beadbeating step was performed prior to a standard hot acid - phenol - chloroform RNA extraction protocol to extract bacterial RNA from infected lung tissues.	phenol,64,70,Chemical	chloroform,73,83,Chemical	"[{""token"": ""phenol"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""chloroform"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"	test

These include 3 genes already identified by Baltes et al. using SCOTS at the end of the acute stage of the disease [ 18]: fucI, encoding the L - fucose isomerase, nrdD, encoding an anaerobic ribonucleoside triphosphate reductase, and apxIVA, encoding the ApxIVA toxin structural protein.

In E. coli, the mal genes are essential for the transport and utilization of maltose and maltodextrin [ 56].	maltose,77,84,Chemical	maltodextrin,89,101,Chemical	"[{""token"": ""maltose"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""maltodextrin"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"	test
The phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and fumarate reductase subunit C, respectively encoded by genes pepC and frdC, are also required during anaerobic growth.	phosphoenolpyruvate,4,23,Chemical	fumarate,40,48,Chemical	"[{""token"": ""phosphoenolpyruvate"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""fumarate"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"	test
Besides metabolic gene sets involved in trehalose and ascorbate utilization, several known virulence factors were downregulated in AP bacteria, and these included the SpeB operon, GRAB, EndoS, and CAMP factor.	trehalose,40,49,Chemical	ascorbate,54,63,Chemical	"[{""token"": ""trehalose"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""ascorbate"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"	test
For example, among the downregulated gene sets are those involved in citrate metabolism, arginine degradation, and de novo pyrimidine synthesis; many of those gene sets were previously reported to be perturbed upon blood inoculation and to be controlled by CovR [ 61] and RopB / Rgg [ 38].	citrate,69,76,Chemical	pyrimidine,123,133,Chemical	"[{""token"": ""citrate"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""pyrimidine"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"	test
For the purpose of insertional inactivation, the vector pVA891 - 2 that provides erythromycin ( Em) resistance was used.	erythromycin,81,93,Chemical	Em,96,98,Chemical	"[{""token"": ""erythromycin"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""Em"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"	test
As result, most of human bac gene positive strains showed resistance or intermediate resistance to Em in the standard diffusion disk test, that is in agreement with previous observations demonstrating an increase in Em resistance in S. agalactiae population [ 30], [ 31].

Similarly, ATP - binding and Mg2 + - binding sites located at C - terminal end of Sak188, which are essential for phosphorylation, were lost in Sak188 protein due to the mutagenesis.
