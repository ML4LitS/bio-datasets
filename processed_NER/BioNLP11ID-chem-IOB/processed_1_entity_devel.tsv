Wild - type Salmonella grown at pH 5. 8 were > 100 000 - fold more resistant to polymyxin B than organisms grown at pH 7. 7.	"polymyxin B	80	91	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""polymyxin B"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Our results suggest that protonation of the PmrB periplasmic histidine and / or of the glutamic acid residues activate the PmrA protein, and that mild acid promotes cellular changes resulting in polymyxin B resistance.

The transcriptional activation of PmrA - regulated genes taking place at pH 5. 8 could be due to trace amounts of metals such as Fe3 +, which is more soluble at acidic pH.	"Fe3 +	129	134	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Fe3 +"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
To rule out this possibility, we treated the culture medium with Chelex 100 resin, an agent known to chelate polyvalent metal ions that does not affect Salmonella growth.	"Chelex 100	65	75	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Chelex 100"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Consistent with this notion, pbgP transcription was abrogated in the pmrB mutant upon deletion of the pta and ackA genes ( Fig. 3), which encode the two enzymes that are required for the production of acetyl phosphate ( Wolfe, 2005) ( Fig. 1).	"acetyl phosphate	201	217	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""acetyl phosphate"", ""start_span"": 201, ""end_span"": 217, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
In contrast, a strain lacking the ability to synthesize acetyl phosphate but with a functional pmrB gene exhibited wild - type pbgP expression levels ( Fig. 3), implying that under normal conditions ( i. e. when a functional pmrB gene is present) acetyl phosphate does not contribute to PmrA phosphorylation.

These results imply that the pmrD gene was being expressed even though the media contained 10 mM MgCl2, a concentration known to repress transcription of PhoP - activated genes ( Soncini et al., 1996).	"MgCl2	97	102	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""MgCl2"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
In agreement with the gene transcription data, Western blot analysis of crude extracts using anti - PmrD antibodies showed that the PmrD protein was produced in cells grown in N - minimal medium pH 5. 8 and 10 mM MgCl2 but not in cells grown in the same medium buffered at pH 7. 7 ( Fig. 4B).	"MgCl2	213	218	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""MgCl2"", ""start_span"": 213, ""end_span"": 218, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
In fact, PmrB is required for the activation of PmrA - regulated genes in response to the low Mg2 + signal, which is sensed by the PhoQ protein ( Kato and Groisman, 2004) ( Fig. 1).	"Mg2 +	94	99	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Mg2 +"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Strains expressing the mutant PmrB proteins could express pbgP normally in response to the low Mg2 + signal ( Fig. 6C) ( Wosten et al., 2000), indicating that mutations in residues of the periplasmic domain of PmrB do not impair the enzymatic activity of the cytoplasmic domain of the PmrB protein.

Mild acid pH induces resistance to the antimicrobial peptide polymyxin B	"polymyxin B	61	72	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""polymyxin B"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Because the PmrA / PmrB system is required for resistance to the antimicrobial peptide polymyxin B ( Roland et al., 1993), we hypothesized that mild acid pH could induce this resistance.	"polymyxin B	87	98	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""polymyxin B"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
In fact, the survival of wild - type cells to a challenge with polymyxin B was 100 000 - fold higher when they were grown at pH 5. 8 than when grown at pH 7. 7 ( Fig. 7).	"polymyxin B	63	74	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""polymyxin B"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
This resistance was PmrA - dependent because a strain deficient in the pmrA gene was approximately 100 000 - fold more sensitive to polymyxin B than the wild - type strain when grown pH 5. 8 ( Fig. 7).

Likewise, the human receptor OGR1 responds to both pH and sphingosylphosphorylcholine ( Ludwig et al., 2003).	"sphingosylphosphorylcholine	58	85	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""sphingosylphosphorylcholine"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
The fact that the PmrB H35A and the E64A mutant proteins displayed partial activity in response to ferric iron but were severely impaired in their ability to respond to acid pH ( compare Fig. 6B and D) supports the notion that these signals are sensed independently.

Because several PmrA - activated gene products are responsible for remodelling the LPS structure and these modifications are required for resistance to certain antimicrobial peptides and toxic metals, one possibility is that acidic environments provide a means to induce the cell envelope changes resulting in resistance.

Indeed, when grown at pH 5. 8 wild - type Salmonella were 100 000 - fold more resistant to polymyxin B than when grown at pH 7. 7 ( Fig. 7).	"polymyxin B	91	102	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""polymyxin B"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Finally, while a role for the PmrA - dependent LPS modifications in the previously described acid tolerance response is unlikely because survival to acid stress ( pH approximately3) was not reduced in cells deficient in pmrA ( data not shown and Bearson et al., 1998), some of the PmrA - regulated genes to which no function has been ascribed yet could mediate other cellular responses to acid pH.

SL1344 and SR1304 carrying either pMAB69 ( hilE - lacZY) or pJB5 ( hilD - lacZY) were cultivated in TB that was buffered to pH 7. 0 with 0. 1M MOPS, to minimize pH effects arising from growth in the presence of the various carbon sources.
