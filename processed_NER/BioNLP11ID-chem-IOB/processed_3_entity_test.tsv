In X. koppenhoeferi, gene trxB is influenced by arabinose and selenium, and gene znuA is influenced by etoposide ( see Additional file 2).

Further, as a cofactor in the metabolism of fatty acids and leucine, biotin plays a role in TCA cycle by assisting in metabolic reactions and helping to transfer carbon dioxide [ 58].

Finally, the kpsF gene, coding for an arabinose - 5 - phosphate isomerase, should also be mentioned since it is involved in the pathway responsible for the synthesis of 2 - keto - 3deozyoctulosonic acid ( Kdo), which is present in the A. pleuropneumoniae LPS core oligosaccharide [ 52] and capsule of serotype 5 [ 53].

Although it is not known whether maltose or maltodextrin are readily available as carbohydrate sources in mammalian lungs, it was previously shown that maltodextrin utilization is important for the colonization of the oro - pharynx in Group A Streptococcus [ 57, 58].

Phenotype Microarrays show no major nutritional or metabolic differences between wild type and animal - passaged, hypervirulent M1T1 GAS We used Biolog ( R) Phenotype Microarrays ( PM) to screen 1900 different growth conditions, including a large set of different carbon and nitrogen sources, pH values and salt concentrations, as well as different concentrations of various antimicrobial agents ( Fig. S1), and found that both WT and AP GAS have similar growth requirements in vitro with minor differences.
