For example, genes encoding proteins involved in folate biosynthesis [ 40] were upregulated, suggesting that certain cofactors that may be necessary during adherence were unavailable.	"folate	49	55	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""folate"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Also upregulated were genes encoding subunits of the F0F1 ATPase [ 41] ( discussed in more detail later), which may indicate an acid stress response to maintain cytoplasmic pH or a need to generate ATP in response to increased energy requirements.

However, despite a rigorous statistical approach, this analysis, like many previous microarray studies, identified the differential expression of a large number of unknown genes ( n = 21) and a number of incomplete biological pathways ( e. g., F0F1 ATPase [ 41] and folate biosynthesis [ 40]) by failing to detect the differential expression of a number of known gene pathway members ( Table 1).

For example, we initially identified ( Table 1) the significant upregulation of three of the five known gene members of the folate biosynthetic pathway [ 40] ( spy1096 - 1100), but GenomeCrawler identified a significant cluster containing all five genes ( Table 3 and Figure 2B).

Among the genes expressed at low level in the phoP - ko strain and in H37Ra were several that are involved in lipid metabolism; for example, the polyketide synthases pks2 ( rv3825c) or the Pks - associated protein papA1 ( rv3824c).

In addition, NirA ( Rv2391), a putative nitrite reductase and MmpL10 - FadD21 ( Rv1183 - 85c), which were all identified by TraSH analysis as potentially implicated in virulence [ 16], seem to be regulated by PhoP [ 12, 21].

In P. luminescens, this TCS controls the expression of the pbgPE operon which is involved in lipid A modification and thus plays a role in colonization and infection of the invertebrate hosts [ 18, 31].

Regulation by AHL - LuxR - like receptors Virulence, bioluminescence, mutualism, antibiotic production and biofilm formation are often regulated by LuxI / LuxR quorum sensing systems in Gram - negative bacteria.	"AHL	14	17	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""AHL"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
These AHLs are produced by an autoinductor synthase named LuxI.	"AHLs	6	10	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""AHLs"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"

In the genome of P. luminescens, two genes encoding putative AHL - LuxR - like receptors, plu0320 and plu4562, but no luxI genes are present ( Fig. 3).	"AHL	61	64	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""AHL"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
This suggests that P. luminescens does not produce its own AHL signalling molecule, but might be able to sense those produced by other bacteria and therefore to detect mixed microbial communities as demonstrated for Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli [ 35 - 37].

It is interesting to note that Sodalis glossinidius strain morsitans, an endosymbiont of the tse tse fly Glossina morsitans morsitans [ 38], also has two pontential AHL - LuxR receptors, SG1740 and SG0285, but no luxI homologue ( Fig. 3).

35 of these potential LuxR - like receptors exhibit PAS _ 4 signal binding domains instead of an AHL - binding domain, and two have a signalling domain with a yet unidentified motif ( Fig. 3).

In addition to phenotypes that affect virulence properties indirectly, c - di - GMP can also directly regulate virulence factors [ 56, 57].	"c - di - GMP	71	83	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""c - di - GMP"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Proteins containing a so - called GGDEF domain are responsible for the synthesis of c - di - GMP, and those with a so - called EAL domain for its degradation.	"c - di - GMP	84	96	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""c - di - GMP"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
The expression and activity of those GGDEF and EAL domain containing proteins is regulated by factors with a PilZ domain that binds c - di - GMP.	"c - di - GMP	132	144	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""c - di - GMP"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
The protein AdrA ( YE3010, GGDEF domain) is annotated as a putative diguanylate cyclase, YE2278 ( GGDEF + EAL) as a putative phosphodiesterase, YE3818 ( GGDEF) as a putative regulator, and YE3806 ( GGDEF + EAL) as a putative exported protein.

The presence of c - di - GMP mediated regulation in Y. enterocolitica is therefore suggested to play a central role in switching from biofilm formation to the human as well as to the insect environment.	"c - di - GMP	16	28	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""c - di - GMP"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
This phenomenon is quite surprising, because with few exceptions such as Helicobacter pylori, nearly all pathogenic bacteria use c - di - GMP as a second messenger.	"c - di - GMP	129	141	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""c - di - GMP"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
The lack of these protein domains in P. luminescens reveals that c - di - GMP signalling plays a major role in pathogenic bacteria when colonizing a mammalian host, and a minor for invertebrate colonization of entomopathogenic or entomoinfecting bacteria.

Remarkably, their expression is induced by low iron concentration as encountered in the insect host, and phlA / phlB are up - regulated at 18degreesC compared to 28degreesC in Y. ruckeri [ 66].

In contrast, P. luminescens produces several factors involved in host cell interaction without homologues in Y. enterocolitica, namely Plu2096 which is similar to lectin PA - I, Plu1561 with strong homology to a Ca2 + dependent adhesion molecule, the adhesin Plu2433 similar to a virulence factor of the Gram - negative plant pathogen Erwinia carotovora, EvF, which is involved in colonisation of the D. melanogaster gut epithelium [ 80], and the putative invasin Plu2064.

Furthermore, we found homologues of the Y. enterocolitica low - calcium - response genes ( lcrH, lcrV, and lrcD) in P. luminescens ( plu3757, plu3758, sctV) which further supports this hypothesis.

Ymt is essential for flea colonization by Y. pestis and is regulated by AHL both in Y. pestis [ 95] and P. luminescens ( R.

Furthermore, P. luminescens encodes two putative heme - binding hemopexin - like proteins, the photopexins PpxA ( Plu4242) and PpxB ( Plu4243), which are the first hemopexins found in bacteria.

It also indicates that iron acquisition is a prerequisite for the infection process of pathogenic bacteria not only in mammalian, but also in invertebrate hosts, and underlines the suggestion that genetic determinants of invertebrate pathogens such as P. luminescens include the progenitors of virulence factors against vertebrates [ 79, 106].

Another example that might enlighten the evolution of bacterial pathogenicity is the plasticity zone ( PZ) of Y. enterocolitica, a 199 kb key locus for high pathogenicity that includes YAPIYe, secretion systems, hydrogenase loci essential for gut colonization of S. typhimurium and H. pylori [ 122], and iron acquisition systems.

Only few other genes or operons of the PZ are also present in P. luminescens, namely a chitinase, two iron acquisition systems, and three ysa genes, thus confirming the idea of a patchwork of horizontally acquired genes within the PZ [ 23].

Dissecting the genomes of Y. enterocolitica and P. luminescens for putative key regulators, we identified factor groups ( AI - 2, PAS - 4 / LuxR like receptors) possibly involved in pathogen - insect association only, those with members contributing to either insect or mammalian pathogenicity ( QS, TKS, Usp), and c - di - GMP signalling probably not involved in regulation of activities against insects.

One such mechanism is based upon modification of phospholipids in the cytoplasmic membrane by introducing a positively charged lysyl group into anionic phosphatidylglycerol by the MprF protein, thereby neutralizing the net charge of the membrane surface [ 11, 12].

The graRS mutant bound significantly more cytochrome c than the WT or the complemented mutant ( Fig. 1A), which is in accordance with the recently described reduced content of D - alanine residues in the teichoic acids of the mutant [ 10].

This finding indicates that the increased binding of cytochrome c by the graRS mutant is due to decreased alanylation of teichoic acids and that the resulting surface charge alteration does not result from other regulatory effects mediated by GraRS.

Flow cytometry analysis suggested that although PMN was detected in the lower well consisted of IL - 8 and severe invasive GAS, but most of them were dead as defined by propidium iodine staining ( p = 0. 016) ( Figure 2A and 2C) demonstrating that severe invasive GAS affected survival of PMN and its migration activity in a transwell system.

Results of these studies demonstrated that while overexpression of wildtype Rv2623 retards the growth of the recipient strain relative to cells transformed with vector alone, growth of the strains overexpressing ATP - binding - deficient mutant Rv2623 are only minimally affected by overexpression as assessed by spotting serial dilutions of the cultures of the appropriate strains onto solid Middlebrook 7H10 agar ( data not shown) as well as by monitoring the time to detection using the BD BACTEC 9000MB system ( Figure 8A).

Recent transcriptional analysis of Rv2623, while confirming the essentiality of the two 18 bp palindromic DosR - binding motifs that are present in the promoter region of this gene [ 38] for induction of Rv2623 under low oxygen conditions, also demonstrated the presence of additional regulatory elements within the rv2623 5 ' - untranslated region [ 18].

Putative functional differences between USPs are implied by their assignment to two subclasses: one whose members do not bind ATP and another whose constituents bind and hydrolyze adenine nucleotide substrates [ 8], [ 26], [ 27], [ 45], [ 46].

Furthermore, given that the attenuated growth phenotype caused by overexpression of Rv2623 could be abrogated by mutations that interfere with the binding of this protein to its nucleotide substrate, it is likely that the mycobacterial growth - regulatory faculty of Rv2623 is mediated by an ATP - dependent function.
