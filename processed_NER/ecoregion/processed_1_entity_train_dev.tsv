High Prevalence of Quorum - Sensing and Quorum - Quenching Activity among Cultivable Bacteria and Metagenomic Sequences in the Mediterranean Sea There is increasing evidence being accumulated regarding the importance of N - acyl homoserine lactones ( AHL) - mediated quorum - sensing ( QS) and quorum - quenching ( QQ) processes in the marine environment, but in most cases, data has been obtained from specific microhabitats, and subsequently little is known regarding these activities in free - living marine bacteria.
