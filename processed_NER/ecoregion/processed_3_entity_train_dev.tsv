Briefly, in 2006, Lake Fuschlsee ( FU) and Lake Wallersee ( WA) were sampled every 2 weeks from week 16 ( mid of April) until week 50 ( mid of December); Lake Augstsee ( AU) was sampled from weeks 28 to 44.

They have the highest nutrient load within the Osterseen Lake District, ranging from eutrophic ( Lake Waschsee and Schiffhttensee) to mesotrophic ( Lake Fohnsee).

Here, we studied the nearsurface ( 030cm) soil microbial communities of 35 soil samples collected from most of the areas of the Qaidam Basin, which is the largest basin on the QinghaiTibet Plateau.

In contrast to the other four northern lakes, its water is blue and very clear, with summer Secchi depths often exceeding 10 m. Group IV These five lakes form a side chain, which feeds into the main chain at Lake Fohnsee.

Water flows from Lake Herrensee, which is the only one in this group with a groundwater source, through lakes Fischkaltersee, Bruhaussee, Eishaussee and then into Lake Fohnsee.

Finally, water from the turbid lake FAS 3 and from the clear lake FAS 4 mixes in the lowest lake FAS 6.

The two deep sea samples from the Mediterranean were collected in the Aegean Sea ( 600m, bottom depth 699m) and Ionian Sea ( 3500m, bottom depth 3633m) in October 2010.

The lakes are kettle lakes of glacial origin and are classed as hard - water lakes, characterized by high calcium carbonate concentrations and slightly alkaline pH ( ranging from 7. 5 to 8. 8).

Particularly Lake Grosser Ostersee, and to a lesser extent Lake Ameisensee and the Western and Eastern Lake Breitenauersee are characterized by very high CaCO3 concentrations, which results in biogenic CaCO3 precipitation in summer ( Gruenert and Raeder, 2014), leading to a distinct turquoise water color and low Secchi depths.
