Higher plasma ammonium levels and more rapid onset of hyperammonemia were seen in 18 patients with bacterial infections ( p = 0. 003 and 0. 0006, respectively) and in nine patients receiving high daily doses ( 2600 or 1800 mg / m2) of 5 - FU ( p = 0. 0001 and < 0. 0001, respectively).

In 25 out of 32 episodes ( 78%), plasma ammonium levels and mental status returned to normal within 2 days after adequate management.	[]
In conclusion, hyperammonemic encephalopathy can occur in patients receiving continuous infusion of 5 - FU.	"hyperammonemic encephalopathy	15	44	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hyperammonemic encephalopathy"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

The effects of quinine and 4 - aminopyridine on conditioned place preference and changes in motor activity induced by morphine in rats.	[]
1.	[]
The effects of two unselective potassium ( K ( +) -) channel blockers, quinine ( 12. 5, 25 and 50 mg / kg) and 4 - aminopyridine ( 1 and 2 mg / kg), on conditioned place preference and biphasic changes in motor activity induced by morphine ( 10 mg / kg) were tested in Wistar rats.	[]
Quinine is known to block voltage -, calcium - and ATP - sensitive K ( +) - channels while 4 - aminopyridine is known to block voltage - sensitive K ( +) - channels.	[]
2.	[]
In the counterbalanced method, quinine attenuated morphine - induced place preference, whereas 4 - aminopyridine was ineffective.	[]
In the motor activity test measured with an Animex - activity meter neither of the K ( +) - channel blockers affected morphine - induced hypoactivity, but both K ( +) - channel blockers prevented morphine - induced secondary hyperactivity.

These results suggest the involvement of quinine - sensitive but not 4 - aminopyridine - sensitive K ( +) - channels in morphine reward.	[]
It is also suggested that the blockade of K ( +) - channels sensitive to these blockers is not sufficient to prevent morphine - induced hypoactivity whereas morphine - induced hyperactivity seems to be connected to both quinine - and 4 - aminopyridine - sensitive K ( +) - channels.

Nociceptin / orphanin FQ and nocistatin on learning and memory impairment induced by scopolamine in mice.	"learning and memory impairment	43	73	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""learning and memory impairment"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
1.	[]
Nociceptin, also known as orphanin FQ, is an endogenous ligand for the orphan opioid receptor - like receptor 1 ( ORL1) and involves in various functions in the central nervous system ( CNS).	[]
On the other hand, nocistatin is recently isolated from the same precursor as nociceptin and blocks nociceptin - induced allodynia and hyperalgesia.

2.	[]
Although ORL1 receptors which display a high degree of sequence homology with classical opioid receptors are abundant in the hippocampus, little is known regarding their role in learning and memory.	[]
3.	[]
The present study was designed to investigate whether nociceptin / orphanin FQ and nocistatin could modulate impairment of learning and memory induced by scopolamine, a muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist, using spontaneous alternation of Y - maze and step - down type passive avoidance tasks in mice.	"impairment of learning and memory	109	142	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""impairment of learning and memory"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
4.	[]
While nocistatin ( 0. 5 - 5. 0 nmol mouse - 1, i. c. v.) administered 30 min before spontaneous alternation performance or the training session of the passive avoidance task, had no effect on spontaneous alternation or passive avoidance behaviours, a lower per cent alternation and shorter median step - down latency in the retention test were obtained in nociceptin ( 1. 5 and / or 5. 0 nmol mouse - 1, i. c. v.) - treated normal mice.	[]
5.	[]
Administration of nocistatin ( 1. 5 and / or 5. 0 nmol mouse - 1, i. c. v.) 30 min before spontaneous alternation performance or the training session of the passive avoidance task, attenuated the scopolamine - induced impairment of spontaneous alternation and passive avoidance behaviours.	[]
6.	[]
These results indicated that nocistatin, a new biologically active peptide, ameliorates impairments of spontaneous alternation and passive avoidance induced by scopolamine, and suggested that these peptides play opposite roles in learning and memory.	[]

The antipsychotic agent, remoxipride [ ( S) - ( -) - 3 - bromo - N - [ ( 1 - ethyl - 2 - pyrrolidinyl) methyl] - 2, 6 - dimethoxybenz amide] has been associated with acquired aplastic anemia.	"aplastic anemia	175	190	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""aplastic anemia"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 190, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
We have examined the ability of remoxipride, three pyrrolidine ring metabolites and five aromatic ring metabolites of the parent compound to induce apoptosis in HL60 cells and human bone marrow progenitor ( HBMP) cells.	[]
Cells were treated for 0 - 24 h with each compound ( 0 - 200 microM).	[]
Apoptosis was assessed by fluorescence microscopy in Hoechst 33342 - and propidium iodide stained cell samples.	[]
Results were confirmed by determination of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation using gel electrophoresis for HL60 cell samples and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase assay in HBMP cells.	[]
The catechol and hydroquinone metabolites, NCQ436 and NCQ344, induced apoptosis in HL60 and HBMP cells in a time - and concentration dependent manner, while the phenols, NCR181, FLA873, and FLA797, and the derivatives formed by oxidation of the pyrrolidine ring, FLA838, NCM001, and NCL118, had no effect.	[]
No necrosis was observed in cells treated with NCQ436 but NCQ344 had a biphasic effect in both cell types, inducing apoptosis at lower concentrations and necrosis at higher concentrations.

These data show that the catechol and hydroquinone metabolites of remoxipride have direct toxic effects in HL60 and HBMP cells, leading to apoptosis, while the phenol metabolites were inactive.	[]
Similarly, benzene - derived catechol and hydroquinone, but not phenol, induce apoptosis in HBMP cells [ Moran et al., Mol. Pharmacol., 50 ( 1996) 610 - 615].	[]
We propose that remoxipride and benzene may induce aplastic anemia via production of similar reactive metabolites and that the ability of NCQ436 and NCQ344 to induce apoptosis in HBMP cells may contribute to the mechanism underlying acquired aplastic anemia that has been associated with remoxipride.

It also induced an increase in the number of NADPH - d - positive cells in the dorsal part of the caudate and accumbens nuclei compared with haloperidol and in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus compared with saline.	[]
In contrast, there was a decrease in NADPH - d neuron number in the substantia nigra, pars compacta in both haloperidol - treated and L - NOARG - treated animals.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: The results give further support to the hypothesis that NO plays a role in motor behavior control and suggest that it may take part in the synaptic changes produced by antipsychotic treatment.	[]

INTERVENTIONS: Treadmill exercise and dobutamine stress were performed on different days.	[]
Quantitative assessment of systolic and diastolic left ventricular function was performed using transthoracic echocardiography at baseline and at regular intervals after each test.	[]
RESULTS: Both forms of stress led to prolonged but reversible systolic and diastolic dysfunction.	[]
There was no difference in the maximum double product ( p = 0. 53) or ST depression ( p = 0. 63) with either form of stress.	"depression	73	83	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""depression"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

BACKGROUND: The use of appetite suppressants in Europe has been associated with the development of primary pulmonary hypertension ( PPH).	"primary pulmonary hypertension	99	129	Disease/Disorder"	"PPH	132	135	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""primary pulmonary hypertension"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PPH"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Recently, fenfluramine appetite suppressants became widely used in the United States but were withdrawn in September 1997 because of concerns over adverse effects.	[]
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective surveillance study on patients diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension at 12 large referral centers in North America.	"pulmonary hypertension	96	118	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""pulmonary hypertension"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Data collected on patients seen from September 1, 1996, to December 31, 1997, included the cause of the pulmonary hypertension and its severity.	"pulmonary hypertension	104	126	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""pulmonary hypertension"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Patients with no identifiable cause of pulmonary hypertension were classed as PPH.

A history of drug exposure also was taken with special attention on the use of antidepressants, anorexigens, and amphetamines.	[]
RESULTS: Five hundred seventy - nine patients were studied, 205 with PPH and 374 with pulmonary hypertension from other causes ( secondary pulmonary hypertension [ SPH]).	"PPH	69	72	Disease/Disorder"	"pulmonary hypertension	86	108	Disease/Disorder"	"pulmonary hypertension	86	108	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""PPH"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""pulmonary hypertension"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""pulmonary hypertension"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The use of anorexigens was common in both groups.	[]
However, of the medications surveyed, only the fenfluramines had a significant preferential association with PPH as compared with SPH ( adjusted odds ratio for use > 6 months, 7. 5; 95% confidence interval, 1. 7 to 32. 4).	"PPH	109	112	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""PPH"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The association was stronger with longer duration of use when compared to shorter duration of use and was more pronounced in recent users than in remote users.	[]
An unexpectedly high ( 11. 4%) number of patients with SPH had used anorexigens.	[]
CONCLUSION: The magnitude of the association with PPH, the increase of association with increasing duration of use, and the specificity for fenfluramines are consistent with previous studies indicating that fenfluramines are causally related to PPH.

The high prevalence of anorexigen use in patients with SPH also raises the possibility that these drugs precipitate pulmonary hypertension in patients with underlying conditions associated with SPH.

However, additional important untoward effects of heparin therapy include heparin - induced thrombocytopenia, heparin - associated osteoporosis, eosinophilia, skin reactions, allergic reactions other than thrombocytopenia, alopecia, transaminasemia, hyperkalemia, hypoaldosteronism, and priapism.

These side effects are relatively rare in a given individual, but given the extremely widespread use of heparin, some are quite common, particularly HITT and osteoporosis.	"HITT	149	153	Disease/Disorder"	"osteoporosis	158	170	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HITT"", ""start_span"": 149, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""osteoporosis"", ""start_span"": 158, ""end_span"": 170, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
"Although reasonable incidences of many of these side effects can be "" softly "" deduced from current reports dealing with unfractionated heparin, at present the incidences of these side effects with newer low molecular weight heparins appear to be much less common."	[]
However, only longer experience will more clearly define the incidence of each side effect with low molecular weight preparations.	[]

Recent findings in a bipolar patient receiving maintenance lithium therapy who developed hypercalcemia and severe bradyarrhythmia prompted the authors to conduct a retrospective study of bipolar patients with lithium - associated hypercalcemia.

After eliminating spurious hypercalcemias or those associated with intravenous fluids, the authors identified 18 non - lithium - treated patients with hypercalcemias related to malignancies and other medical conditions ( group A) and 12 patients with lithium - associated hypercalcemia ( group B).	"hypercalcemias	27	41	Disease/Disorder"	"hypercalcemias	27	41	Disease/Disorder"	"malignancies	177	189	Disease/Disorder"	"hypercalcemia	27	40	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hypercalcemias"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""hypercalcemias"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""malignancies"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 189, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""hypercalcemia"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Patients in group B were not comparable to those in group A, as the latter were medically compromised and were receiving multiple pharmacotherapies.	[]
Thus, two control groups were generated: group C1, which included age - and sex - comparable lithium - treated bipolar normocalcemic patients, and group C2, which included bipolar normocalcemic patients treated with anticonvulsant mood stabilizers.

The electrocardiographic ( ECG) findings for patients in group B were compared with those of patients in groups C1 and C2.	[]
It was found that these groups did not differ in their overall frequency of ECG abnormalities; however, there were significant differences in the frequency of conduction defects.	[]
Patients with hypercalcemia resulting from medical diseases and bipolar patients with lithium - associated hypercalcemia had significantly higher frequencies of conduction defects.

Patients in group A had significant mortality at 2 - year follow - up ( 28%), in contrast to zero mortality in the other three groups.	[]
The clinical implications of these findings are discussed.	[]

We compared the toxicity of NS - 718 with that of Fungizone ( amphotericin B - sodium deoxycholate; D - AmB) in vitro using renal cell cultures and in vivo by biochemical analysis, histopathological study of the kidney and pharmacokinetic study of amphotericin B following intravenous infusion of the formulation in rats.	"toxicity	16	24	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""toxicity"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Incubation with NS - 718 resulted in significantly less damage of cultured human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells compared with D - AmB.	[]
Serum blood urea and creatinine concentrations increased significantly in rats given an iv infusion of D - AmB 3 mg / kg but not in those given the same dose of NS - 718.	[]
Histopathological examination of the kidney showed tubular necrosis in D - AmB - treated rats but no change in NS - 718 - treated rats.	"tubular necrosis	51	67	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tubular necrosis"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Amphotericin B concentrations in the kidney in NS - 718 - treated rats were higher than those in D - AmB - treated rats.	[]
Our in vitro and in vivo results suggest that incorporation of amphotericin B into lipid nanospheres of NS - 718 attenuates the nephrotoxicity of amphotericin B.

The hemodynamic and antiadrenergic effects of dronedarone, a noniodinated compound structurally related to amiodarone, were compared with those of amiodarone after prolonged oral administration, both at rest and during sympathetic stimulation in conscious dogs with a healed myocardial infarction.	"myocardial infarction	275	296	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""myocardial infarction"", ""start_span"": 275, ""end_span"": 296, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
All dogs ( n = 6) randomly received orally dronedarone ( 10 and 30 mg / kg), amiodarone ( 10 and 30 mg / kg), and placebo twice daily for 7 days, with a 3 - week washout between consecutive treatments.	[]
Heart rate ( HR), mean arterial pressure ( MBP), positive rate of increase of left ventricular pressure ( + LVdP / dt), echocardiographically assessed left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF), and fractional shortening ( FS), as well as chronotropic response to isoproterenol and exercise - induced sympathetic stimulation were evaluated under baseline and posttreatment conditions.	[]
Resting values of LVEF, FS, + LVdP / dt, and MBP remained unchanged whatever the drug and the dosing regimen, whereas resting HR was significantly and dose - dependently lowered after dronedarone and to a lesser extent after amiodarone.	[]
Both dronedarone and amiodarone significantly reduced the exercise - induced tachycardia and, at the highest dose, decreased the isoproterenol - induced tachycardia.

The primary efficacy measure was the Young - Mania Rating Scale ( Y - MRS) total score.	"Mania	45	50	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Mania"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Response and euthymia were defined, a priori, as at least a 50% improvement from baseline to end point and as a score of no less than 12 at end point in the Y - MRS total score, respectively.	[]
Safety was assessed using adverse events, Extrapyramidal Symptom ( EPS) rating scales, laboratory values, electrocardiograms, vital signs, and weight change.

A driving simulator ( Transport Research Laboratory) was used to measure reaction time ( RT), speed maintenance and steering accuracy.	[]
Tests of basic visual function included high - and low - contrast visual acuity ( HCVA and LCVA), Pelli - Robson contrast threshold ( CT) and Goldmann perimetry ( FIELDS).	[]
Useful Field of View ( UFOV - - a test of visual attention) was also undertaken.	[]
The mean differences in the pre - and post - dilatation measurements were tested for statistical significance at the 95% level using one - tail paired t - tests.	[]
RESULTS: Pupillary dilation resulted in a statistically significant deterioration in CT and HCVA only.	"Pupillary dilation	9	27	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Pupillary dilation"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Five of 12 drivers also exhibited deterioration in LCVA, CT and RT.	[]

The Assessment of Treatment with Lisinopril and Survival.	[]
BACKGROUND: Treatment with angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE) inhibitors reduces mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic heart failure ( CHF), but most affected patients are not receiving these agents or are being treated with doses lower than those found to be efficacious in trials, primarily because of concerns about the safety and tolerability of these agents, especially at the recommended doses.

The present study examines the safety and tolerability of high - compared with low - dose lisinopril in CHF.	"CHF	104	107	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""CHF"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
METHODS: The Assessment of Lisinopril and Survival study was a multicenter, randomized, double - blind trial in which patients with or without previous ACE inhibitor treatment were stabilized receiving medium - dose lisinopril ( 12. 5 or 15. 0 mg once daily [ OD]) for 2 to 4 weeks and then randomized to high - ( 35. 0 or 32. 5 mg OD) or low - dose ( 5. 0 or 2. 5 mg OD) groups.

RESULTS: Of 405 patients not previously receiving an ACE inhibitor, doses in only 4. 2% could not be titrated to the medium doses required for randomization because of symptoms possibly related to hypotension ( 2. 0%) or because of renal dysfunction or hyperkalemia ( 2. 3%).

Doses in more than 90% of randomized patients in the high - and low - dose groups were titrated to their assigned target, and the mean doses of blinded medication in both groups remained similar throughout the study.	[]
Withdrawals occurred in 27. 1% of the high - and 30. 7% of the low - dose groups.	[]
Subgroups presumed to be at higher risk for ACE inhibitor intolerance ( blood pressure, < 120 mm Hg; creatinine, > or = 132. 6 micromol / L [ > or = 1. 5 mg / dL]; age, > or = 70 years; and patients with diabetes) generally tolerated the high - dose strategy.

The appearance of MPO - ANCA in these cases was suspected of being related to PTU because the titres of MPO - ANCA decreased when PTU was stopped.	[]
Nevertheless, there have been no studies on the temporal relationship between the appearance of MPO - ANCA and vasculitis during PTU therapy, or on the incidence of MPO - ANCA in untreated Graves ' disease patients.

Phase 2 early afterdepolarization as a trigger of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in acquired long - QT syndrome: direct evidence from intracellular recordings in the intact left ventricular wall.

BACKGROUND: This study examined the role of phase 2 early afterdepolarization ( EAD) in producing a trigger to initiate torsade de pointes ( TdP) with QT prolongation induced by dl - sotalol and azimilide.	"torsade de pointes	120	138	Disease/Disorder"	"TdP	141	144	Disease/Disorder"	"QT prolongation	151	166	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""torsade de pointes"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""TdP"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""QT prolongation"", ""start_span"": 151, ""end_span"": 166, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The contribution of transmural dispersion of repolarization ( TDR) to transmural propagation of EAD and the maintenance of TdP was also evaluated.	"TdP	123	126	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""TdP"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
METHODS AND RESULTS: Transmembrane action potentials from epicardium, midmyocardium, and endocardium were recorded simultaneously, together with a transmural ECG, in arterially perfused canine and rabbit left ventricular preparations.	[]
dl - Sotalol preferentially prolonged action potential duration ( APD) in M cells dose - dependently ( 1 to 100 micromol / L), leading to QT prolongation and an increase in TDR.	"QT prolongation	138	153	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""QT prolongation"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Azimilide, however, significantly prolonged APD and QT interval at concentrations from 0. 1 to 10 micromol / L but shortened them at 30 micromol / L.	[]
Unlike dl - sotalol, azimilide ( > 3 micromol / L) increased epicardial APD markedly, causing a diminished TDR.	[]
Although both dl - sotalol and azimilide rarely induced EADs in canine left ventricles, they produced frequent EADs in rabbits, in which more pronounced QT prolongation was seen.	"QT prolongation	153	168	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""QT prolongation"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 168, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
An increase in TDR by dl - sotalol facilitated transmural propagation of EADs that initiated multiple episodes of spontaneous TdP in 3 of 6 rabbit left ventricles.	"TdP	126	129	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""TdP"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Of note, although azimilide ( 3 to 10 micromol / L) increased APD more than dl - sotalol, its EADs often failed to propagate transmurally, probably because of a diminished TDR.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first direct evidence from intracellular action potential recordings that phase 2 EAD can be generated from intact ventricular wall and produce a trigger to initiate the onset of TdP under QT prolongation.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: Chest pain in the setting of cocaine use poses a diagnostic dilemma.	"Chest pain	17	27	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Chest pain"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Dobutamine stress echocardiography ( DSE) is a widely available and sensitive test for evaluating cardiac ischemia.	"ischemia	106	114	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ischemia"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Because of the theoretical concern regarding administration of dobutamine in the setting of cocaine use, we conducted a pilot study to assess the safety of DSE in emergency department patients with cocaine - associated chest pain.	"chest pain	219	229	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""chest pain"", ""start_span"": 219, ""end_span"": 229, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
METHODS: A prospective case series was conducted in the intensive diagnostic and treatment unit in the ED of an urban tertiary - care teaching hospital.	[]
Patients were eligible for DSE if they had used cocaine within 24 hours preceding the onset of chest pain and had a normal ECG and tropinin I level.	"chest pain	95	105	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""chest pain"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

All patients were admitted to the hospital for serial testing after the DSE testing in the intensive diagnostic and treatment unit.	[]
RESULTS: Twenty - four patients were enrolled.	[]
Two patients had inadequate resting images, one DSE was terminated because of inferior hypokinesis, another DSE was terminated because of a rate - related atrial conduction deficit, and 1 patient did not reach the target heart rate.	"hypokinesis	87	98	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hypokinesis"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Thus, 19 patients completed a DSE and reached their target heart rates.	[]
None of the patients experienced signs of exaggerated adrenergic response, which was defined as a systolic blood pressure of greater than 200 mm Hg or the occurrence of tachydysrhythmias ( excluding sinus tachycardia).	"tachydysrhythmias	169	186	Disease/Disorder"	"sinus tachycardia	199	216	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tachydysrhythmias"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 186, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""sinus tachycardia"", ""start_span"": 199, ""end_span"": 216, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Further suggesting lack of exaggerated adrenergic response, 13 ( 65%) of 20 patients required supplemental atropine to reach their target heart rates.	[]
CONCLUSION: No exaggerated adrenergic response was detected when dobutamine was administered to patients with cocaine - related chest pain.	"chest pain	128	138	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""chest pain"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and cranial sonograms obtained during a 1 - year period on 122 premature ( < 36 weeks of gestation) infants.	[]
Infants were categorized into 1 of 2 groups: those exposed to cocaine and those not exposed to cocaine.	[]
Infants were assigned to the cocaine - exposed group if there was a maternal history of cocaine abuse during pregnancy or if maternal or neonatal urine toxicology results were positive at the time of delivery.	"cocaine abuse	88	101	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cocaine abuse"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
RESULTS: Five of the 122 infants were excluded from the study because of insufficient medical and drug histories.	[]
The incidence of subependymal cysts in the 117 remaining infants was 14% ( 16 of 117).	"subependymal cysts	17	35	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""subependymal cysts"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The incidence of subependymal cysts in infants exposed to cocaine prenatally was 44% ( 8 of 18) compared with 8% ( 8 of 99) in the unexposed group ( p < 0. 01).	"subependymal cysts	17	35	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""subependymal cysts"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
CONCLUSIONS: We found an increased incidence of subependymal cyst formation in preterm infants who were exposed to cocaine prenatally.

We prospectively evaluated thalidomide - induced neuropathy using electrodiagnostic studies.	"neuropathy	49	59	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""neuropathy"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Sixty - seven men with metastatic androgen - independent prostate cancer in an open - label trial of oral thalidomide underwent neurologic examinations and nerve conduction studies ( NCS) prior to and at 3 - month intervals during treatment.	"prostate cancer	57	72	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""prostate cancer"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
NCS included recording of sensory nerve action potentials ( SNAPs) from median, radial, ulnar, and sural nerves.	[]
SNAP amplitudes for each nerve were expressed as the percentage of its baseline, and the mean of the four was termed the SNAP index.	[]
A 40% decline in the SNAP index was considered clinically significant.	[]
Thalidomide was discontinued in 55 patients for lack of therapeutic response.	[]
Of 67 patients initially enrolled, 24 remained on thalidomide for 3 months, 8 remained at 6 months, and 3 remained at 9 months.	[]
Six patients developed neuropathy.	"neuropathy	23	33	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""neuropathy"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Clinical symptoms and a decline in the SNAP index occurred concurrently.	[]
Older age and cumulative dose were possible contributing factors.	[]
Neuropathy may thus be a common complication of thalidomide in older patients.	"Neuropathy	0	10	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Neuropathy"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

The participation of reactive oxygen species in aminoglycoside - induced ototoxicity has been deduced from observations that aminoglycoside - iron complexes catalyze the formation of superoxide radicals in vitro and that antioxidants attenuate ototoxicity in vivo.	"ototoxicity	73	84	Disease/Disorder"	"ototoxicity	73	84	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ototoxicity"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""ototoxicity"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
We therefore hypothesized that overexpression of Cu / Zn - superoxide dismutase ( h - SOD1) should protect transgenic mice from ototoxicity.	"ototoxicity	128	139	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ototoxicity"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Immunocytochemistry confirmed expression of h - SOD1 in inner ear tissues of transgenic C57BL / 6 - TgN [ SOD1] 3Cje mice.	[]
Transgenic and nontransgenic littermates received kanamycin ( 400 mg / kg body weight / day) for 10 days beginning on day 10 after birth.	[]
Auditory thresholds were tested by evoked auditory brain stem responses at 1 month after birth.	[]
In nontransgenic animals, the threshold in the kanamycin - treated group was 45 - 50 dB higher than in saline - injected controls.	[]
In the transgenic group, kanamycin increased the threshold by only 15 dB over the respective controls.	[]
The effects were similar at 12 and 24 kHz.	[]
The protection by overexpression of superoxide dismutase supports the hypothesis that oxidant stress plays a significant role in aminoglycoside - induced ototoxicity.

Dose - response relationships and effect of sex.	[]
Dose - response relationships, biochemical mechanisms, and sex differences in the experimental fatty liver induced by tetracycline were studied in the intact rat and with the isolated perfused rat liver in vitro.	"fatty liver	95	106	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""fatty liver"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In the intact male and female rat, no direct relationship was observed between dose of tetracycline and hepatic accumulation of triglyceride.	[]
With provision of adequate oleic acid as a substrate for the isolated perfused liver, a direct relationship was observed between dose of tetracycline and both accumulation of triglyceride in the liver and depression of output of triglyceride by livers from male and female rats.	"depression	205	215	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""depression"", ""start_span"": 205, ""end_span"": 215, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Marked differences were observed between female and male rats with regard to base line ( control) hepatic concentration of triglyceride and output of triglyceride.	[]
Accumulation of hepatic triglyceride, as a per cent of control values, in response to graded doses of tetracycline, did not differ significantly between male, female and pregnant rat livers.	[]
However, livers from female, and especially pregnant female rats, were strikingly resistant to the effects of tetracycline on depression of output of triglyceride under these experimental conditions.	"depression	126	136	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""depression"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
These differences between the sexes could not be related to altered disposition of tetracycline or altered uptake of oleic acid.	[]
Depressed hepatic secretion of triglyceride accounted only for 30 to 50% of accumulated hepatic triglyceride, indicating that additional mechanisms must be involved in the production of the triglyceride - rich fatty liver in response to tetracycline.

Four groups were used, i) the PAN group ( 14), ii) PAN / temocapril ( 13), iii) temocapril ( 14) and iv) untreated controls ( 15).	[]
Temocapril ( 8 mg / kg / day) was administered to the rats which were killed at weeks 4, 14 or 20.	[]
At each time point, systolic blood pressure ( BP), urinary protein excretion and renal histopathological findings were evaluated, and morphometric image analysis was done.	[]
Systolic BP in the PAN group was significantly high at 4, 14 and 20 weeks, but was normal in the PAN / temocapril group.	[]
Urinary protein excretion in the PAN group increased significantly, peaking at 8 days, then decreased at 4 weeks, but rose again significantly at 14 and 20 weeks.	[]
Temocapril did not attenuate proteinuria at 8 days, but it did markedly lower it from weeks 4 to 20.	"proteinuria	29	40	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""proteinuria"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Inbred DBA / 2 and C57BL / 6 female mice were injected with CY, and the effect of the drug on the bladder was assessed during 100 days by light microscopy using different staining procedures, and after 30 days by conventional electron microscopy.	[]
Early CY toxicity caused a typical haemorrhagic cystitis in both strains that was completely repaired in about 7 - 10 days.

Mast cells appeared in the connective and muscular layers of the bladder at a much higher number in DBA / 2 mice than in C57BL / 6 mice or untreated controls.	[]
Electron microscopy disclosed the absence of the typical discoidal vesicles normally present in the cytoplasm of surface cells.	[]
Instead, numerous abnormal vesicles containing one or several dark granules were observed in the cytoplasm of cells from all the epithelial layers.	[]

Heart and liver mitochondria were isolated from rats treated for 7 weeks with doxorubicin ( 2 mg / kg sc / week), carvedilol ( 1 mg / kg ip / week), or the combination of the two drugs.	[]
Heart mitochondria isolated from doxorubicin - treated rats exhibited depressed rates for state 3 respiration ( 336 + / - 26 versus 425 + / - 53 natom O / min / mg protein) and a lower respiratory control ratio ( RCR) ( 4. 3 + / - 0. 6 versus 5. 8 + / - 0. 4) compared with cardiac mitochondria isolated from saline - treated rats.	[]
Mitochondrial calcium - loading capacity and the activity of NADH - dehydrogenase were also suppressed in cardiac mitochondria from doxorubicin - treated rats.	[]
Doxorubicin treatment also caused a decrease in RCR for liver mitochondria ( 3. 9 + / - 0. 9 versus 5. 6 + / - 0. 7 for control rats) and inhibition of hepatic cytochrome oxidase activity.	[]
Coadministration of carvedilol decreased the extent of cellular vacuolization in cardiac myocytes and prevented the inhibitory effect of doxorubicin on mitochondrial respiration in both heart and liver.	[]
Carvedilol also prevented the decrease in mitochondrial Ca ( 2 +) loading capacity and the inhibition of the respiratory complexes of heart mitochondria caused by doxorubicin.	[]
Carvedilol by itself did not affect any of the parameters measured for heart or liver mitochondria.	[]
It is concluded that this protection by carvedilol against both the structural and functional cardiac tissue damage may afford significant clinical advantage in minimizing the dose - limiting mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiomyopathy that accompanies long - term doxorubicin therapy in cancer patients.

All adenosine receptor agonists significantly decreased the locomotor activity in mice, and the effects were dose - dependent.	"decreased the locomotor activity	46	78	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""decreased the locomotor activity"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
It seems that adenosine A1 and A2 receptors might be involved in this reaction.	[]
Moreover, all adenosine receptor agonists: 2 - p - ( 2 - carboxyethyl) phenethylamino - 5 ' - N - ethylcarboxamidoadenosine ( CGS 21680), A2A receptor agonist, N6 - cyclopentyladenosine ( CPA), A1 receptor agonist, and 5 ' - N - ethylcarboxamidoadenosine ( NECA), A2 / A1 receptor agonist significantly and dose - dependently decreased cocaine - induced locomotor activity.	[]
CPA reduced cocaine action at the doses which, given alone, did not influence motility, while CGS 21680 and NECA decreased the action of cocaine at the doses which, given alone, decreased locomotor activity in animals.	[]
These results suggest the involvement of both adenosine receptors in the action of cocaine although agonists of A1 receptors seem to have stronger influence on it.	[]
The selective blockade of A2 adenosine receptor by DMPX ( 3, 7 - dimethyl - 1 - propargylxanthine) significantly enhanced cocaine - induced locomotor activity of animals.	[]
Caffeine had similar action but the effect was not significant.	[]
CPT ( 8 - cyclopentyltheophylline) - - A1 receptor antagonist, did not show any influence in this test.	[]
Similarly, all adenosine receptor agonists decreased amphetamine - induced hyperactivity, but at the higher doses than those which were active in cocaine - induced hyperactivity.

Digoxin was the only other medication associated with an increased risk of pacemaker insertion ( OR: 1. 78, 95% CI: 1. 37 to 2. 31).	[]
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the use of amiodarone in elderly patients with AF and a previous MI increases the risk of bradyarrhythmia requiring a permanent pacemaker.

Nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drug - induced cystitis is a poorly recognized and under - reported condition.	"cystitis	48	56	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cystitis"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In addition to tiaprofenic acid, indomethacin has been reported to be associated with this condition.	[]
METHODS: Three groups were established: a control group ( n = 10), a high - dose group ( n = 10), treated with one intraperitoneal injection of indomethacin 20 mg / kg, and a therapeutic dose group ( n = 10) in which oral indomethacin was administered 3. 25 mg / kg body weight daily for 3 weeks.	[]
The animals were then killed and the bladders removed for light and electron microscopic studies.	[]
RESULTS: The light microscopic findings showed some focal epithelial degeneration that was more prominent in the high - dose group.	[]
When compared with the control group, both indomethacin groups revealed statistically increased numbers of mast cells in the mucosa ( P < 0. 0001) and penetration of lanthanum nitrate through intercellular areas of the epithelium.	[]
Furthermore, the difference in mast cell counts between the high and therapeutic dose groups was also statistically significant ( P < 0. 0001).	[]
CONCLUSIONS: Indomethacin resulted in histopathologic findings typical of interstitial cystitis, such as leaky bladder epithelium and mucosal mastocytosis.

METHODS: Twelve rats ( six chronically epileptic animals and six controls) were anesthetized, given tracheotomies, and subjected to hyperventilation or hypoventilation conditions.

Breathing movements caused changes in thoracic volume and forced air to flow tidally through a pneumotachograph.	[]
This flow was measured by using a differential pressure transducer, passed through a polygraph, and from this to a computer with custom software that derived ventilation ( VE), tidal volume ( VT), inspiratory time ( TI), expiratory time ( TE), breathing frequency ( f), and mean inspiratory flow ( VT / TI) on a breath - by - breath basis.	[]
RESULTS: The hyperventilation maneuver caused a decrease in spontaneous ventilation in pilocarpine - treated and control rats.	"hyperventilation	13	29	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hyperventilation"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Although VE had a similar decrease in both groups, in the epileptic group, the decrease in VE was due to a significant ( p < 0. 05) increase in TE peak in relation to that of the control animals.	"epileptic	58	67	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""epileptic"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The hypoventilation maneuver led to an increase in the arterial Paco2, followed by an increase in VE.	[]
In the epileptic group, the increase in VE was mediated by a significant ( p < 0. 05) decrease in TE peak compared with the control group.	"epileptic	7	16	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""epileptic"", ""start_span"": 7, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Systemic application of KCN, to evaluate the effects of peripheral chemoreception activation on ventilation, led to a similar increase in VE for both groups.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that pilocarpine - treated animals have an altered ability to react to ( or compensate for) blood gas changes with changes in ventilation and suggest that it is centrally determined.	[]
We speculate on the possible relation of the current findings on treating different epilepsy - associated conditions.	"epilepsy	84	92	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""epilepsy"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Progesterone potentiation of bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity in pentobarbital - anesthetized rats and beating rat heart cell cultures.	[]
The effects of progesterone treatment on bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity in beating rat heart myocyte cultures and on anesthetized rats were determined.	[]
After determining the bupivacaine AD50 ( the concentration of bupivacaine that caused 50% of all beating rat heart myocyte cultures to become arrhythmic), we determined the effect of 1 - hour progesterone HCl exposure on myocyte contractile rhythm.	"arrhythmic	142	152	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""arrhythmic"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Each concentration of progesterone ( 6. 25, 12. 5, 25, and 50 micrograms / ml) caused a significant and concentration - dependent reduction in the AD50 for bupivacaine.	[]
Estradiol treatment also increased the arrhythmogenicity of bupivacaine in myocyte cultures, but was only one fourth as potent as progesterone.	[]
Neither progesterone nor estradiol effects on bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity were potentiated by epinephrine.	[]
Chronic progesterone pretreatment ( 5 mg / kg / day for 21 days) caused a significant increase in bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity in intact pentobarbital - anesthetized rats.	[]
There was a significant decrease in the time to onset of arrhythmia as compared with control nonprogesterone - treated rats ( 6. 2 + / - 1. 3 vs. 30. 8 + / - 2. 5 min, mean + / - SE).

There was no relationship of sFas to eventual outcome in the patients.	[]
A significant correlation was observed between serum sFas levels and aspartate aminotransferase ( r = 0. 613, P < 0. 01).	[]
CONCLUSIONS: The increased concentration of sFas in serum of patients with acute liver failure may reflect activation of Fas - mediated apoptosis in the liver and this together with increased tumor necrosis factor - alpha may be an important factor in liver cell loss.

Current options of treatment include oral anticholinergic drugs, the topical application of anticholinergics or aluminum chloride, and the injection of botulinum toxin.	[]
Thirteen patients have been treated to date with 1. 5% or 2% topical glycopyrrolate.	[]
All patients had gustatory hyperhidrosis, which interfered with their social activities, after transthroacic endoscopic sympathectomy, and which was associated with compensatory focal hyperhidrosis.

All had reported incidents of being very embarrassed whilst eating hot spicy foods.	[]
Adverse effects included a mildly dry mouth and a sore throat in 2 patients ( 2% glycopyrrolate), a light headache in 1 patient ( 1. 5% glycopyrrolate).

Can it be treated with bromocriptine?	[]
Six stable psychiatric outpatients with hyperprolactinemia and amenorrhea / oligomenorrhea associated with their neuroleptic medications were treated with bromocriptine.

Daily dosages of 5 - 10 mg corrected the hyperprolactinemia and restored menstruation in four of the six patients.	"hyperprolactinemia	41	59	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hyperprolactinemia"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Thus, three of six patients had their menstrual irregularity successfully corrected with bromocriptine.	[]
This suggests that bromocriptine should be further evaluated as potential therapy for neuroleptic - associated hyperprolactinemia and amenorrhea / galactorrhea.

Intracerebroventricular injection of ethacrynic acid ( 50% convulsive dose; 50 micrograms / mouse) accelerated the synthesis / turnover of 5 - hydroxytryptamine ( 5 - HT) but suppressed the synthesis of gamma - aminobutyric acid and acetylcholine in mouse brain.

These effects were completely antagonized by pretreatment with a glutamate / N - methyl - D - aspartate antagonist, aminophosphonovaleric acid.	[]
In ethacrynic acid - induced convulsions, these neurotransmitter systems may be differentially modulated, probably through activation of glutaminergic neurons in the brain.

Pharmacology of gamma - aminobutyric acidA receptor complex after the in vivo administration of the anxioselective and anticonvulsant beta - carboline derivative abecarnil.	[]
In rodents, the effect of the beta - carboline derivative isopropyl - 6 - benzyloxy - 4 - methoxymethyl - beta - carboline - 3 - carboxylate ( abecarrnil), a new ligand for benzodiazepine receptors possessing anxiolytic and anticonvulsant properties, was evaluated on the function of central gamma - aminobutyric acid ( GABA) A receptor complex, both in vitro and in vivo.	[]
Added in vitro to rat cortical membrane preparation, abecarnil increased [ 3H] GABA binding, enhanced muscimol - stimulated 36Cl - uptake and reduced the binding of t - [ 35S] butylbicyclophosphorothionate ( [ 35S] TBPS).	[]
These effects were similar to those induced by diazepam, whereas the partial agonist Ro 16 - 6028 ( tert - butyl - ( S) - 8 - bromo - 11, 12, 13, 13a - tetrahydro - 9 - oxo - 9H - imidazo [ 1, 5 - a] - pyrrolo - [ 2, 1 - c] [ 1, 4] benzodiazepine - 1 - carboxylate) showed very weak efficacy in these biochemical tests.	[]
After i. p. injection to rats, abecarnil and diazepam decreased in a time - dependent and dose - related ( 0. 25 - 20 mg / kg i. p.) manner [ 35S] TBPS binding measured ex vivo in the cerebral cortex.	[]
Moreover, both drugs at the dose of 0. 5 mg / kg antagonized completely the convulsant activity and the increase of [ 35S] TBPS binding induced by isoniazide ( 350 mg / kg s. c.) as well as the increase of [ 35S] TBPS binding induced by foot - shock stress.	[]
To better correlate the biochemical and the pharmacological effects, we studied the action of abecarnil on [ 35S] TBPS binding, exploratory motility and on isoniazid - induced biochemical and pharmacological effects in mice.	[]
In these animals, abecarnil produced a paralleled dose - dependent ( 0. 05 - 1 mg / kg i. p.) reduction of both motor behavior and cortical [ 35S] TBPS binding.	[]
Moreover, 0. 05 mg / kg of this beta - carboline reduced markedly the increase of [ 35S] TBPS binding and the convulsions induced by isoniazid ( 200 mg / kg s. c.).

The trials that are available are generally small with limitations in design and these show variation in patient benefit.	[]
More convincing evidence is required showing that digoxin improves symptoms or exercise capacity.	[]
Furthermore, no trial has had sufficient power to evaluate mortality.	[]
Pooled analysis of the effects of other inotropic drugs shows an excess mortality and there is a possibility that digoxin may increase mortality after myocardial infarction ( MI).

We used high - resolution MRI and surface - based computational image analyses to map regional abnormalities in the cortex, hippocampus, white matter, and ventricles in 22 human subjects who used MA and 21 age - matched, healthy controls.	[]
Cortical maps revealed severe gray - matter deficits in the cingulate, limbic, and paralimbic cortices of MA abusers ( averaging 11. 3% below control; p < 0. 05).	[]
On average, MA abusers had 7. 8% smaller hippocampal volumes than control subjects ( p < 0. 01; left, p = 0. 01; right, p < 0. 05) and significant white - matter hypertrophy ( 7. 0%; p < 0. 01).

MA may selectively damage the medial temporal lobe and, consistent with metabolic studies, the cingulate - limbic cortex, inducing neuroadaptation, neuropil reduction, or cell death.	[]
Prominent white - matter hypertrophy may result from altered myelination and adaptive glial changes, including gliosis secondary to neuronal damage.

Disruption of hepatic lipid homeostasis in mice after amiodarone treatment is associated with peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - alpha target gene activation.	[]
Amiodarone, an efficacious and widely used antiarrhythmic agent, has been reported to cause hepatotoxicity in some patients.	"hepatotoxicity	92	106	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hepatotoxicity"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
To gain insight into the mechanism of this unwanted effect, mice were administered various doses of amiodarone and examined for changes in hepatic histology and gene regulation.	[]
Amiodarone induced hepatomegaly, hepatocyte microvesicular lipid accumulation, and a significant decrease in serum triglycerides and glucose.	"hepatomegaly	19	31	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hepatomegaly"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Northern blot analysis of hepatic RNA revealed a dose - dependent increase in the expression of a number of genes critical for fatty acid oxidation, lipoprotein assembly, and lipid transport.	[]
Many of these genes are regulated by the peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - alpha ( PPARalpha), a ligand - activated nuclear hormone receptor transcription factor.	[]
The absence of induction of these genes as well as hepatomegaly in PPARalpha knockout [ PPARalpha - / -] mice indicated that the effects of amiodarone were dependent upon the presence of a functional PPARalpha gene.	"hepatomegaly	51	63	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hepatomegaly"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Compared to wild - type mice, treatment of PPARalpha - / - mice with amiodarone resulted in an increased rate and extent of total body weight loss.	"weight loss	135	146	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""weight loss"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The inability of amiodarone to directly activate either human or mouse PPARalpha transiently expressed in human HepG2 hepatoma cells indicates that the effects of amiodarone on the function of this receptor were indirect.	"hepatoma	118	126	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hepatoma"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Effects of the antidepressant trazodone, a 5 - HT 2A / 2C receptor antagonist, on dopamine - dependent behaviors in rats.	[]
RATIONALE: 5 - Hydroxytryptamine, via stimulation of 5 - HT 2C receptors, exerts a tonic inhibitory influence on dopaminergic neurotransmission, whereas activation of 5 - HT 2A receptors enhances stimulated DAergic neurotransmission.	[]
The antidepressant trazodone is a 5 - HT 2A / 2C receptor antagonist.	[]
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of trazodone treatment on behaviors dependent on the functional status of the nigrostriatal DAergic system.	[]

CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that trazodone at 2. 5 - 20 mg / kg does not block pre - and postsynaptic striatal D2 DA receptors, while at 30, 40 and 50 mg / kg it blocks postsynaptic striatal D2 DA receptors.	[]
Furthermore, at 5, 10 and 20 mg / kg, trazodone blocks 5 - HT 2A and 5 - HT 2C receptors.	[]
We suggest that trazodone ( 5, 10 and 20 mg / kg), by blocking the 5 - HT 2C receptors, releases the nigrostriatal DAergic neurons from tonic inhibition caused by 5 - HT, and thereby potentiates dexamphetamine stereotypy and antagonizes haloperidol catalepsy.

The challenge was considered positive if one or more of the following appeared: erythema, rush or urticaria - angioedema.	"erythema	80	88	Disease/Disorder"	"urticaria	98	107	Disease/Disorder"	"angioedema	110	120	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""erythema"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""urticaria"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""angioedema"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
RESULTS: No reaction was observed with placebo and eight patients ( 88. 8%) tolerated CE.	[]
Only one patient developed a moderate angioedema of the lips.	"angioedema	38	48	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""angioedema"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
CONCLUSION: Only one hypersensitivity reaction to CE was documented among 9 P and N - highly NSAIDs intolerant patients.	"hypersensitivity	21	37	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hypersensitivity"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

BACKGROUND: Studies on the association between the long - term use of aspirin and other analgesic and nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) and end - stage renal disease ( ESRD) have given conflicting results.	"end - stage renal disease	155	180	Disease/Disorder"	"ESRD	183	187	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""end - stage renal disease"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 180, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""ESRD"", ""start_span"": 183, ""end_span"": 187, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In order to examine this association, a case - control study with incident cases of ESRD was carried out.	"ESRD	84	88	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ESRD"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
METHODS: The cases were all patients entering the local dialysis program because of ESRD in the study area between June 1, 1995 and November 30, 1997.	"ESRD	84	88	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ESRD"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
They were classified according to the underlying disease, which had presumably led them to ESRD.	"ESRD	91	95	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ESRD"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Controls were patients admitted to the same hospitals from where the cases arose, also matched by age and sex.	[]
Odds ratios were calculated using a conditional logistic model, including potential confounding factors, both for the whole study population and for the various underlying diseases.	[]
RESULTS: Five hundred and eighty - three cases and 1190 controls were included in the analysis.	[]
Long - term use of any analgesic was associated with an overall odds ratio of 1. 22 ( 95% CI, 0. 89 - 1. 66).	[]
For specific groups of drugs, the risks were 1. 56 ( 1. 05 - 2. 30) for aspirin, 1. 03 ( 0. 60 - 1. 76) for pyrazolones, 0. 80 ( 0. 39 - 1. 63) for paracetamol, and 0. 94 ( 0. 57 - 1. 56) for nonaspirin NSAIDs.	[]
The risk of ESRD associated with aspirin was related to the cumulated dose and duration of use, and it was particularly high among the subset of patients with vascular nephropathy as underlying disease [ 2. 35 ( 1. 17 - 4. 72)].

CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that long - term use of nonaspirin analgesic drugs and NSAIDs is not associated with an increased risk of ESRD.	"ESRD	136	140	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ESRD"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Growth - associated protein 43 expression in hippocampal molecular layer of chronic epileptic rats treated with cycloheximide.	"epileptic	84	93	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""epileptic"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
PURPOSE: GAP43 has been thought to be linked with mossy fiber sprouting ( MFS) in various experimental models of epilepsy.	"epilepsy	113	121	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""epilepsy"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
To investigate how GAP43 expression ( GAP43 - ir) correlates with MFS, we assessed the intensity ( densitometry) and extension ( width) of GAP43 - ir in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus ( IML) of rats subject to status epilepticus induced by pilocarpine ( Pilo), previously injected or not with cycloheximide ( CHX), which has been shown to inhibit MFS.	"status epilepticus	226	244	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""status epilepticus"", ""start_span"": 226, ""end_span"": 244, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
METHODS: CHX was injected before the Pilo injection in adult Wistar rats.	[]
The Pilo group was injected with the same drugs, except for CHX.	[]
Animals were killed between 30 and 60 days later, and brain sections were processed for GAP43 immunohistochemistry.	[]
RESULTS: Densitometry showed no significant difference regarding GAP43 - ir in the IML between Pilo, CHX + Pilo, and control groups.	[]
However, the results of the width of the GAP43 - ir band in the IML showed that CHX + Pilo and control animals had a significantly larger band ( p = 0. 03) as compared with that in the Pilo group.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: Our current finding that animals in the CHX + Pilo group have a GAP43 - ir band in the IML, similar to that of controls, reinforces prior data on the blockade of MFS in these animals.	[]
The change in GAP43 - ir present in Pilo - treated animals was a thinning of the band to a very narrow layer just above the granule cell layer that is likely to be associated with the loss of hilar cell projections that express GAP - 43.	[]
Nicotine antagonizes caffeine - but not pentylenetetrazole - induced anxiogenic effect in mice.	[]
RATIONALE: Nicotine and caffeine are widely consumed licit psychoactive drugs worldwide.	[]
Epidemiological studies showed that they were generally used concurrently.	[]
Although some studies in experimental animals indicate clear pharmacological interactions between them, no studies have shown a specific interaction on anxiety responses.	"anxiety	152	159	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""anxiety"", ""start_span"": 152, ""end_span"": 159, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
OBJECTIVES: The present study investigates the effects of nicotine on anxiety induced by caffeine and another anxiogenic drug, pentylenetetrazole, in mice.	"anxiety	70	77	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""anxiety"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The elevated plus - maze ( EPM) test was used to evaluate the effects of drugs on anxiety.	"anxiety	82	89	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""anxiety"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
METHODS: Adult male Swiss Webster mice ( 25 - 32 g) were given nicotine ( 0. 05 - 0. 25 mg / kg s. c.) or saline 10 min before caffeine ( 70 mg / kg i. p.) or pentylenetetrazole ( 15 and 30 mg / kg i. p.) injections.	[]
After 15 min, mice were evaluated for their open - and closed - arm time and entries on the EPM for a 10 - min session.	[]
Locomotor activity was recorded for individual groups by using the same treatment protocol with the EPM test.	[]
RESULTS: Nicotine ( 0. 05 - 0. 25 mg / kg) itself did not produce any significant effect in the EPM test, whereas caffeine ( 70 mg / kg) and pentylenetetrazole ( 30 mg / kg) produced an anxiogenic effect, apparent with decreases in open - arm time and entry.	[]
Nicotine ( 0. 25 mg / kg) pretreatment blocked the caffeine - but not pentylenetetrazole - induced anxiety.	"anxiety	99	106	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""anxiety"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Administration of each drug and their combinations did not produce any effect on locomotor activity.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the antagonistic effect of nicotine on caffeine - induced anxiety is specific to caffeine, instead of a non - specific anxiolytic effect.	"anxiety	96	103	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""anxiety"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Thus, it may extend the current findings on the interaction between nicotine and caffeine.	[]

SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the following databases up to November 2004: the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biological Abstracts.	[]
Relevant non - indexed journals and conference abstracts were also searched.	[]
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised double - blind trials of HT ( oestrogens with or without progestogens) versus placebo, taken for at least one year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women.	[]
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Fifteen RCTs were included.	[]
Trials were assessed for quality and two review authors extracted data independently.	[]
They calculated risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes.	[]
Clinical heterogeneity precluded meta - analysis for most outcomes.	[]
MAIN RESULTS: All the statistically significant results were derived from the two biggest trials.	[]
In relatively healthy women, combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thromboembolism or coronary event ( after one year ' s use), stroke ( after 3 years), breast cancer ( after 5 years) and gallbladder disease.

Among relatively healthy women over 65 years taking continuous combined HT, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of dementia.	"dementia	143	151	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""dementia"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Among women with cardiovascular disease, long - term use of combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thromboembolism.	"cardiovascular disease	17	39	Disease/Disorder"	"venous thromboembolism	119	141	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cardiovascular disease"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""venous thromboembolism"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
No trials focussed specifically on younger women.	[]
However, one trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy 50 to 59 year - old women taking combined continuous HT and 1637 taking oestrogen - only HT, versus similar - sized placebo groups.	[]
The only significantly increased risk reported was for venous thromboembolism in women taking combined continuous HT; their absolute risk remained very low.	"venous thromboembolism	55	77	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""venous thromboembolism"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
AUTHORS ' CONCLUSIONS: HT is not indicated for the routine management of chronic disease.	"chronic disease	73	88	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""chronic disease"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
We need more evidence on the safety of HT for menopausal symptom control, though short - term use appears to be relatively safe for healthy younger women.	[]

Further evaluation of causality assessment was centrally performed.	[]
RESULTS: Since April 1994 to August 2004, 461 out of 570 submitted cases, involving 505 drugs, were deemed to be related to DILI.	"DILI	124	128	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""DILI"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The antiinfective group of drugs was the more frequently incriminated, amoxicillin - clavulanate accounting for the 12. 8% of the whole series.	[]
The hepatocellular pattern of damage was the most common ( 58%), was inversely correlated with age ( P <. 0001), and had the worst outcome ( Cox regression, P <. 034).	[]
Indeed, the incidence of liver transplantation and death in this group was 11. 7% if patients had jaundice at presentation, whereas the corresponding figure was 3. 8% in nonjaundiced patients ( P <. 04).

The aims of this study were to examine vancomycin ( VCM) - induced oxidative stress that promotes production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS) and to investigate the role of erdosteine, an expectorant agent, which has also antioxidant properties, on kidney tissue against the possible VCM - induced renal impairment in rats.	"renal impairment	299	315	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""renal impairment"", ""start_span"": 299, ""end_span"": 315, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Rats were divided into three groups: sham, VCM and VCM plus erdosteine.	[]
VCM was administrated intraperitoneally ( i. p.) with 200mgkg ( - 1) twice daily for 7 days.	[]
Erdosteine was administered orally.	[]
VCM administration to control rats significantly increased renal malondialdehyde ( MDA) and urinary N - acetyl - beta - d - glucosaminidase ( NAG, a marker of renal tubular injury) excretion but decreased superoxide dismutase ( SOD) and catalase ( CAT) activities.	"renal tubular injury	159	179	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""renal tubular injury"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 179, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Erdosteine administration with VCM injections caused significantly decreased renal MDA and urinary NAG excretion, and increased SOD activity, but not CAT activity in renal tissue when compared with VCM alone.	[]
Erdosteine showed histopathological protection against VCM - induced nephrotoxicity.	"nephrotoxicity	69	83	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""nephrotoxicity"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
There were a significant dilatation of tubular lumens, extensive epithelial cell vacuolization, atrophy, desquamation, and necrosis in VCM - treated rats more than those of the control and the erdosteine groups.

Erdosteine caused a marked reduction in the extent of tubular damage.	[]
It is concluded that oxidative tubular damage plays an important role in the VCM - induced nephrotoxicity and the modulation of oxidative stress with erdosteine reduces the VCM - induced kidney damage both at the biochemical and histological levels.

Because ideal lipid targets were not reached ( low - density lipoprotein ( LDL) cholesterol less than 130 mg / dl, high - density lipoprotein ( HDL) cholesterol greater than 35 mg / dl, or total cholesterol / HDL cholesterol less than 4. 5 mg / dl) with diet plus a single drug, gemfibrozil ( 1. 2 g / day) - lovastatin ( primarily 20 or 40 mg) treatment was given.	[]
Follow - up visits were scheduled with 2 - drug therapy every 6 to 8 weeks, an average of 10. 3 visits per patient, with 741 batteries of 6 liver function tests and 714 creatine phosphokinase levels measured.	[]
Only 1 of the 4, 446 liver function tests ( 0. 02%), a gamma glutamyl transferase, was greater than or equal to 3 times the upper normal limit.	[]
Of the 714 creatine phosphokinase levels, 9% were high; only 1 ( 0. 1%) was greater than or equal to 3 times the upper normal limit.	[]
With 2 - drug therapy, mean total cholesterol decreased 22% from 255 to 200 mg / dl, triglyceride levels decreased 35% from 236 to 154 mg / dl, LDL cholesterol decreased 26% from 176 to 131 mg / dl, and the total cholesterol / HDL cholesterol ratio decreased 24% from 7. 1 to 5. 4, all p less than or equal to 0. 0001.

There is now evidence to suggest a central role for the dopaminergic system in restless legs syndrome ( RLS).

For example, the symptoms of RLS can be dramatically improved by levodopa and dopamine agonists, whereas central dopamine D2 receptor antagonists can induce or aggravate RLS symptoms.

To our knowledge, there is no previous report regarding whether domperidone, a peripheral dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, can also induce or aggravate symptoms of RLS.	"RLS	164	167	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""RLS"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 167, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Mirtazapine, the first noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant ( NaSSA), has been associated with RLS in several recent publications.	"RLS	113	116	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""RLS"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The authors report here a depressed patient comorbid with postprandial dyspepsia who developed RLS after mirtazapine had been added to his domperidone therapy.

Our patient started to have symptoms of RLS only after he had been treated with mirtazapine, and his RLS symptoms resolved completely upon discontinuation of his mirtazapine.

Such a temporal relationship between the use of mirtazapine and the symptoms of RLS in our patient did not support a potentiating effect of domperione on mirtazapine - associated RLS.

After admission, the patient received a continuous intravenous infusion of 5 - FU ( 1000 mg / day), during which precordial pain with right bundle branch block occurred concomitantly with a high serum FBAL concentration of 1955 ng / ml.

Instead, oral administration of S - 1 ( a derivative of 5 - FU), at 200 mg / day twice a week, was instituted, because S - 1 has a strong inhibitory effect on dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the degradative of 5 - FU into FBAL.	[]
The serum FBAL concentration subsequently decreased to 352 ng / ml, the same as the value measured on the first day of S - 1 administration.	[]

PURPOSE: Despite its well - known cardiotoxicity, the anthracyclin doxorubicin ( DOX) continues to be an effective and widely used chemotherapeutic agent.	"cardiotoxicity	34	48	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cardiotoxicity"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
DOX - induced cardiac damage presumably results from the formation of free radicals by DOX.	"cardiac damage	14	28	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cardiac damage"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Reactive oxygen species particularly affect the cardiac myocytes because these cells seem to have a relatively poor antioxidant defense system.	[]
The semisynthetic flavonoid monohydroxyethylrutoside ( monoHER) showed cardioprotection against DOX - induced cardiotoxicity through its radical scavenging and iron chelating properties.	"cardiotoxicity	110	124	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cardiotoxicity"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Because of the relatively short final half - life of monoHER ( about 30 min), it is expected that the time interval between monoHER and DOX might be of influence on the cardioprotective effect of monoHER.	[]
Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate this possible effect.	[]
METHODS: Six groups of 6 BALB / c mice were treated with saline, DOX alone or DOX ( 4 mg / kg i. v.) preceded by monoHER ( 500 mg / kg i. p.) with an interval of 10, 30, 60 or 120 min.	[]
After a 6 - week treatment period and additional observation for 2 weeks, the mice were sacrificed.	[]
Their cardiac tissues were processed for light microscopy, after which cardiomyocyte damage was evaluated according to Billingham ( in Cancer Treat Rep 62 ( 6): 865 - 872, 1978).	"cardiomyocyte damage	71	91	Disease/Disorder"	"Cancer	135	141	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cardiomyocyte damage"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""Cancer"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Microscopic evaluation revealed that treatment with DOX alone induced significant cardiac damage in comparison to the saline control group ( P < 0. 001).	"cardiac damage	82	96	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cardiac damage"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
RESULTS: The number of damaged cardiomyocytes was 9. 6 - fold ( 95% CI 4. 4 - 21. 0) higher in mice treated with DOX alone than that in animals of the control group.	[]
The ratio of aberrant cardiomyocytes in mice treated with DOX preceded by monoHER and those in mice treated with saline ranged from 1. 6 to 2. 8 ( mean 2. 2, 95% CI 1. 2 - 4. 1, P = 0. 019).	[]
The mean protective effect by adding monoHER before DOX led to a significant 4. 4 - fold reduction ( P < 0. 001, 95% CI 2. 3 - 8. 2) of abnormal cardiomyocytes.	[]
This protective effect did not depend on the time interval between monoHER and DOX administration ( P = 0. 345).	[]
CONCLUSION: The results indicate that in an outpatient clinical setting monoHER may be administered shortly before DOX.	[]

Enhanced isoproterenol - induced cardiac hypertrophy in transgenic rats with low brain angiotensinogen.	"cardiac hypertrophy	33	52	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cardiac hypertrophy"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
We have previously shown that a permanent deficiency in the brain renin - angiotensin system ( RAS) may increase the sensitivity of the baroreflex control of heart rate.	[]
In this study we aimed at studying the involvement of the brain RAS in the cardiac reactivity to the beta - adrenoceptor ( beta - AR) agonist isoproterenol ( Iso).	[]
Transgenic rats with low brain angiotensinogen ( TGR) were used.	[]
In isolated hearts, Iso induced a significantly greater increase in left ventricular ( LV) pressure and maximal contraction ( + dP / dt ( max)) in the TGR than in the Sprague - Dawley ( SD) rats.	[]
LV hypertrophy induced by Iso treatment was significantly higher in TGR than in SD rats ( in g LV wt / 100 g body wt, 0. 28 + / - 0. 004 vs. 0. 24 + / - 0. 004, respectively).	"LV hypertrophy	0	14	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""LV hypertrophy"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The greater LV hypertrophy in TGR rats was associated with more pronounced downregulation of beta - AR and upregulation of LV beta - AR kinase - 1 mRNA levels compared with those in SD rats.	"LV hypertrophy	12	26	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""LV hypertrophy"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The decrease in the heart rate ( HR) induced by the beta - AR antagonist metoprolol in conscious rats was significantly attenuated in TGR compared with SD rats ( - 9. 9 + / - 1. 7% vs. - 18. 1 + / - 1. 5%), whereas the effect of parasympathetic blockade by atropine on HR was similar in both strains.	[]
These results indicate that TGR are more sensitive to beta - AR agonist - induced cardiac inotropic response and hypertrophy, possibly due to chronically low sympathetic outflow directed to the heart.

In addition to methadone dose, 15 demographic, biological, and pharmacological variables were considered as potential risk factors for QT prolongation.	"QT prolongation	135	150	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""QT prolongation"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
RESULTS: Among 167 methadone maintenance patients, the prevalence of QTc prolongation to 0. 50 second ( ( 1 / 2)) or longer was 16. 2% compared with 0% in 80 control subjects.	[]
Six patients ( 3. 6%) in the methadone group presented torsades de pointes.	"torsades de pointes	55	74	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""torsades de pointes"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
QTc length was weakly but significantly associated with methadone daily dose ( Spearman rank correlation coefficient, 0. 20; P <. 01).	[]
Multivariate regression analysis allowed attribution of 31. 8% of QTc variability to methadone dose, cytochrome P - 450 3A4 drug - drug interactions, hypokalemia, and altered liver function.

Mechanisms of hypertension induced by nitric oxide ( NO) deficiency: focus on venous function.	"hypertension	14	26	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hypertension"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Loss of endothelial cell - derived nitric oxide ( NO) in hypertension is a hallmark of arterial dysfunction.

Experimental hypertension created by the removal of NO, however, involves mechanisms in addition to decreased arterial vasodilator activity.	"hypertension	13	25	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hypertension"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
These include augmented endothelin - 1 ( ET - 1) release, increased sympathetic nervous system activity, and elevated tissue oxidative stress.	[]
We hypothesized that increased venous smooth muscle ( venomotor) tone plays a role in Nomega - nitro - L - arginine ( LNNA) hypertension through these mechanisms.	"hypertension	124	136	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hypertension"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Rats were treated with the NO synthase inhibitor LNNA ( 0. 5 g / L in drinking water) for 2 weeks.	[]
Mean arterial pressure of conscious rats was 119 + / - 2 mm Hg in control and 194 + / - 5 mm Hg in LNNA rats ( P < 0. 05).	[]
Carotid arteries and vena cava were removed for measurement of isometric contraction.	[]
Maximal contraction to norepinephrine was modestly reduced in arteries from LNNA compared with control rats whereas the maximum contraction to ET - 1 was significantly reduced ( 54% control).	[]
Maximum contraction of vena cava to norepinephrine ( 37% control) also was reduced but no change in response to ET - 1 was observed.	[]
Mean circulatory filling pressure, an in vivo measure of venomotor tone, was not elevated in LNNA hypertension at 1 or 2 weeks after LNNA.	"hypertension	98	110	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hypertension"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The superoxide scavenger tempol ( 30, 100, and 300 micromol kg ( - 1), IV) did not change arterial pressure in control rats but caused a dose - dependent decrease in LNNA rats ( - 18 + / - 8, - 26 + / - 15, and - 54 + / - 11 mm Hg).	[]
Similarly, ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium caused a significantly greater fall in LNNA hypertensive rats ( 76 + / - 9 mm Hg) compared with control rats ( 35 + / - 10 mm Hg).	"hypertensive	94	106	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hypertensive"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Carotid arteries, vena cava, and sympathetic ganglia from LNNA rats had higher basal levels of superoxide compared with those from control rats.	[]
These data suggest that while NO deficiency increases oxidative stress and sympathetic activity in both arterial and venous vessels, the impact on veins does not make a major contribution to this form of hypertension.

Recently, many research groups have reported on the positive relationship between the genetic variations in the DRD2 gene and the therapeutic response in schizophrenia patients as a result of the role of variations in the receptor in modulating receptor expression.

METHODS: We identified seven SNP ( single nucleotide polymorphism) ( - 141Cins > del, TaqIB, TaqID, Ser311Cys, rs6275, rs6277 and TaqIA) in the DRD2 gene in 146 schizophrenic inpatients ( 59 with EPS and 87 without EPS according to the Simpson - Angus Scale) treated with chlorpromazine after 8 weeks.

The alleles of all loci were determined by PCR ( polymerase chain reaction).	[]
RESULTS: Polymorphisms TaqID, Ser311Cys and rs6277 were not polymorphic in the population recruited in the present study.	[]
No statistical significance was found in the allele distribution of - 141Cins > del, TaqIB, rs6275 and TaqIA or in the estimated haplotypes ( constituted by TaqIB, rs6275 and TaqIA) in linkage disequilibrium between the two groups.	[]
CONCLUSION: Our results did not lend strong support to the view that the genetic variation of the DRD2 gene plays a major role in the individually variable adverse effect induced by chlorpromazine, at least in Chinese patients with schizophrenia.

In order to elucidate this problem, we have studied the effect of long - term physical activity on susceptibility to subsequent seizures.	"seizures	128	136	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""seizures"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

During the acute period of status epilepticus, we measured: ( 1) the latency of the first motor sign, ( 2) the intensity of seizures, ( 3) the time when it occurred within the 6 - h observation period, and ( 4) the time when the acute period ended.

Tonic dopaminergic stimulation impairs associative learning in healthy subjects.	"impairs associative learning	31	59	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""impairs associative learning"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Because levodopa increases both phasic and tonic dopaminergic neurotransmission, the critical mechanism mediating the enhancement of learning is unresolved.	[]
We here probed how selective tonic dopaminergic stimulation affects associative learning.	[]
Forty healthy subjects were trained in a novel vocabulary of 45 concrete nouns over the course of 5 consecutive training days in a prospective, randomized, double - blind, placebo - controlled design.	[]
Subjects received the tonically stimulating dopamine - receptor agonist pergolide ( 0. 1 mg) vs placebo 120 min before training on each training day.	[]
The dopamine agonist significantly impaired novel word learning compared to placebo.	"impaired novel word learning	35	63	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""impaired novel word learning"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
This learning decrement persisted up to the last follow - up 4 weeks post - training.	[]
Subjects treated with pergolide also showed restricted emotional responses compared to the PLACEBO group.	[]
The extent of ' flattened ' affect with pergolide was related to the degree of learning inhibition.	[]
These findings suggest that tonic occupation of dopamine receptors impairs learning by competition with phasic dopamine signals.	[]
Thus, phasic signaling seems to be the critical mechanism by which dopamine enhances associative learning in healthy subjects and stroke patients.	"stroke	130	136	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""stroke"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

HBIg was administered intravenously during the first week and intramuscularly thereafter.	[]
RESULTS: At a median follow - up of 14. 1 months, the overall recurrence rate in the 51 patients was 3. 9% ( 2 / 51).	[]
The overall patient survival was 88. 3%, and 82. 4% after 1 and 2 years, respectively.	[]
A daily oral dose of 100 mg lamivudine for 2 weeks before transplantation for 10 patients enabled 57. 1% ( 4 / 7) and 62. 5% ( 5 / 8) of HBV - DNA and HBeAg positive patients respectively to convert to be negative.	[]
Intramuscular HBIg was well tolerated in all patients.	[]
CONCLUSION: Lamivudine combined with intramuscular HBIg can effectively prevent allograft from the recurrence of HBV after liver transplantation.	[]

The effects of CAA on cysteine protease activities and thiols could be reproduced in cell lysate.	[]
Acidification, which slowed the reaction of CAA with thiol donors, could also attenuate effects of CAA on necrosis markers, thiol depletion and cysteine protease inhibition in living cells.

Following status epilepticus in the rat, dentate granule cell neurogenesis increases greatly, and many of the new neurons appear to develop ectopically, in the hilar region of the hippocampal formation.	"status epilepticus	10	28	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""status epilepticus"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
It has been suggested that the ectopic hilar granule cells could contribute to the spontaneous seizures that ultimately develop after status epilepticus.	"seizures	95	103	Disease/Disorder"	"status epilepticus	134	152	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""seizures"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""status epilepticus"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
However, the population has never been quantified, so it is unclear whether it is substantial enough to have a strong influence on epileptogenesis.	[]
To quantify this population, the total number of ectopic hilar granule cells was estimated using unbiased stereology at different times after pilocarpine - induced status epilepticus.	"status epilepticus	164	182	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""status epilepticus"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 182, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The number of hilar neurons immunoreactive for Prox - 1, a granule - cell - specific marker, was estimated using the optical fractionator method.	[]
The results indicate that the size of the hilar ectopic granule cell population after status epilepticus is substantial, and stable over time.	"status epilepticus	86	104	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""status epilepticus"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Interestingly, the size of the population appears to be correlated with the frequency of behavioral seizures, because animals with more ectopic granule cells in the hilus have more frequent behavioral seizures.	"seizures	100	108	Disease/Disorder"	"seizures	100	108	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""seizures"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""seizures"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The hilar ectopic granule cell population does not appear to vary systematically across the septotemporal axis, although it is associated with an increase in volume of the hilus.	[]

The patient ' s observations were within normal limits, he was administered oxygen via a face mask and glyceryl trinitrate ( GTN).	[]
Several minutes after the GTN the patient experienced a sudden drop in blood pressure and heart rate, this was rectified by atropine sulphate and a fluid challenge.

There was no further deterioration in the patient ' s condition during transport to hospital.	[]
There are very few documented case like this in the prehospital scientific literature.	[]
The cause appears to be the Bezold - Jarish reflex, stimulation of the ventricular walls which in turn decreases sympathetic outflow from the vasomotor centre.	[]

The lesions were placed via bilateral microinjections of 30 nmol / 200 nl N - methyl - D - aspartic acid.	[]
The restimulation of this area with N - methyl - D - aspartic acid 15 days postlesion failed to produce a pressor response.	[]
One day postlesion, the resting mean arterial pressure was significantly decreased in lesioned rats when compared with sham rats ( 100 + / - 7 versus 173 + / - 4 mm Hg, p less than 0. 05).	[]
Fifteen days later, the lesioned group still showed values significantly lower than the sham group ( 150 + / - 6 versus 167 + / - 5 mm Hg, p less than 0. 05).	[]
No significant heart rate differences were observed between the sham and lesioned groups.	[]
The ganglionic blocker trimethaphan ( 5 mg / kg i. v.) caused similar reductions in mean arterial pressure in both lesioned and sham groups.	[]
The trimethaphan - induced hypotension was accompanied by a significant bradycardia in lesioned rats ( - 32 + / - 13 beats per minute) but a tachycardia in sham rats ( + 33 + / - 12 beats per minute) 1 day postlesion.

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the efficacy and tolerability of valsartan ( VAL) or hydrochlorothiazide ( HCTZ) - monotherapy and higher - dose combinations in patients with essential hypertension.	"essential hypertension	178	200	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""essential hypertension"", ""start_span"": 178, ""end_span"": 200, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
METHODS: The first part of this study was an 8 - week, multicenter, randomized, double - blind, placebo controlled, parallel - group trial.	[]
Patients with essential hypertension ( mean sitting diastolic BP [ MSDBP], > or = 95 mm Hg and < 110 mm Hg) were randomized to 1 of 8 treatment groups: VAL 160 or 320 mg; HCTZ 12. 5 or 25 mg; VAL / HCTZ 160 / 12. 5, 320 / 12. 5, or 320 / 25 mg; or placebo.	"essential hypertension	14	36	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""essential hypertension"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Mean changes in MSDBP and mean sitting systolic BP ( MSSBP) were analyzed at the 8 - week core study end point.	[]
VAL / HCTZ 320 / 12. 5 and 320 / 25 mg were further investigated in a 54 - week, open - label extension.	[]
Response was defined as MSDBP < 90 mm Hg or a > or = 10 mm Hg decrease compared to baseline.	[]
Control was defined as MSDBP < 90 mm Hg compared with baseline.	[]
Tolerability was assessed by monitoring adverse events at randomization and all subsequent study visits and regular evaluation of hematology and blood chemistry.	[]
RESULTS: A total of 1346 patients were randomized into the 8 - week core study ( 734 men, 612 women; 924 white, 291 black, 23 Asian, 108 other; mean age, 52. 7 years; mean weight, 92. 6 kg).	[]
All active treatments were associated with significantly reduced MSSBP and MSDBP during the core 8 - week study, with each monotherapy significantly contributing to the overall effect of combination therapy ( VAL and HCTZ, P < 0. 001).	[]
Each combination was associated with significantly greater reductions in MSSBP and MSDBP compared with the monotherapies and placebo ( all, P < 0. 001).	[]
The mean reduction in MSSBP / MSDBP with VAL / HCTZ 320 / 25 mg was 24. 7 / 16. 6 mm Hg, compared with 5. 9 / 7. 0 mm Hg with placebo.	[]
The reduction in MSSBP was significantly greater with VAL / HCTZ 320 / 25 mg compared with VAL / HCTZ 160 / 12. 5 mg ( P < 0. 002).	[]
Rates of response and BP control were significantly higher in the groups that received combination treatment compared with those that received monotherapy.	[]
The incidence of hypokalemia was lower with VAL / HCTZ combinations ( 1. 8% - 6. 1%) than with HCTZ monotherapies ( 7. 1% - 13. 3%).	"hypokalemia	17	28	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hypokalemia"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The majority of adverse events in the core study were of mild to moderate severity.	[]
The efficacy and tolerability of VAL / HCTZ combinations were maintained during the extension ( 797 patients).	[]
CONCLUSIONS: In this study population, combination therapies with VAL / HCTZ were associated with significantly greater BP reductions compared with either monotherapy, were well tolerated, and were associated with less hypokalemia than HCTZ alone.

Succimer chelation improves learning, attention, and arousal regulation in lead - exposed rats but produces lasting cognitive impairment in the absence of lead exposure.	"cognitive impairment	116	136	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cognitive impairment"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
BACKGROUND: There is growing pressure for clinicians to prescribe chelation therapy at only slightly elevated blood lead levels.	[]
However, very few studies have evaluated whether chelation improves cognitive outcomes in Pb - exposed children, or whether these agents have adverse effects that may affect brain development in the absence of Pb exposure.	[]
OBJECTIVES: The present study was designed to answer these questions, using a rodent model of early childhood Pb exposure and treatment with succimer, a widely used chelating agent for the treatment of Pb poisoning.	"Pb poisoning	202	214	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Pb poisoning"", ""start_span"": 202, ""end_span"": 214, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
RESULTS: Pb exposure produced lasting impairments in learning, attention, inhibitory control, and arousal regulation, paralleling the areas of dysfunction seen in Pb - exposed children.	[]
Succimer treatment of the Pb - exposed rats significantly improved learning, attention, and arousal regulation, although the efficacy of the treatment varied as a function of the Pb exposure level and the specific functional deficit.	[]
In contrast, succimer treatment of rats not previously exposed to Pb produced lasting and pervasive cognitive and affective dysfunction comparable in magnitude to that produced by the higher Pb exposure regimen.	"cognitive and affective dysfunction	100	135	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cognitive and affective dysfunction"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
CONCLUSIONS: These are the first data, to our knowledge, to show that treatment with any chelating agent can alleviate cognitive deficits due to Pb exposure.	"cognitive deficits	119	137	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cognitive deficits"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
These findings suggest that it may be possible to identify a succimer treatment protocol that improves cognitive outcomes in Pb - exposed children.	[]
However, they also suggest that succimer treatment should be strongly discouraged for children who do not have elevated tissue levels of Pb or other heavy metals.	[]

Decreases were evident in both LV end - diastolic pressure ( from 17 + / - 7 to 15 + / - 6 mmHg, p = 0. 0480 and Tau ( from 48 + / - 8 to 45 + / - 8 ms, p < 0. 01), while fractional shortening at the LV base increased from 7. 7 + / - 4. 5% to 9. 4 + / - 4. 5% ( p = 0. 045).	[]
After MAP, increases were identified in both cardiac output ( from 1. 54 + / - 0. 57 to 1. 65 + / - 0. 57 1 / min) and Emax ( from 1. 86 + / - 0. 9 to 2. 41 + / - 1. 31 mmHg / ml).	[]
CONCLUSION: The data acquired suggest that isolated MAP may have certain benefits on LV dimension / function in acute heart failure, even in the absence of MR.

Frequency of transient ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia.	"vocal cord paralysis	35	55	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""vocal cord paralysis"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
BACKGROUND: Especially because of improvements in clinical neurologic monitoring, carotid endarterectomy done under local anesthesia has become the technique of choice in several centers.	[]
Temporary ipsilateral vocal nerve palsies due to local anesthetics have been described, however.	"vocal nerve palsies	22	41	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""vocal nerve palsies"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Such complications are most important in situations where there is a pre - existing contralateral paralysis.	"paralysis	98	107	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""paralysis"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
We therefore examined the effect of local anesthesia on vocal cord function to better understand its possible consequences.	[]
METHODS: This prospective study included 28 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia.	[]
Vocal cord function was evaluated before, during, and after surgery ( postoperative day 1) using flexible laryngoscopy.	[]
Anesthesia was performed by injecting 20 to 40 mL of a mixture of long - acting ( ropivacaine) and short - acting ( prilocaine) anesthetic.	[]
RESULTS: All patients had normal vocal cord function preoperatively.	[]
Twelve patients ( 43%) were found to have intraoperative ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis.	"vocal cord paralysis	69	89	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""vocal cord paralysis"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
It resolved in all cases < or = 24 hours.	[]
There were no significant differences in operating time or volume or frequency of anesthetic administration in patients with temporary vocal cord paralysis compared with those without.	"vocal cord paralysis	135	155	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""vocal cord paralysis"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 155, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
CONCLUSION: Local anesthesia led to temporary ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis in almost half of these patients.	"vocal cord paralysis	58	78	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""vocal cord paralysis"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Because pre - existing paralysis is of a relevant frequency ( up to 3%), a preoperative evaluation of vocal cord function before carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia is recommended to avoid intraoperative bilateral paralysis.

INTRODUCTION: The ability to read facial expressions is essential for normal human social interaction.	[]
The aim of the present study was to conduct the first investigation of facial expression recognition performance in recreational cocaine users.	[]
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three groups, comprised of 21 cocaine naive participants ( CN), 30 occasional cocaine ( OC), and 48 regular recreational cocaine ( RC) users, were compared.	[]
An emotional facial expression ( EFE) task consisting of a male and female face expressing six basic emotions ( happiness, surprise, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust) was administered.	[]
Mean percent accuracy and latencies for correct responses across eight presentations of each basic emotion were derived.	[]
"Participants were also assessed with the "" Eyes task "" to investigate their ability to recognize more complex emotional states and the Symptom CheckList - 90 - Revised to measure psychopathology."	[]
"RESULTS: There were no group differences in psychopathology or "" eyes task "" performance, but the RC group, who otherwise had similar illicit substance use histories to the OC group, exhibited impaired fear recognition accuracy compared to the OC and CN groups."	"impaired fear recognition	193	218	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""impaired fear recognition"", ""start_span"": 193, ""end_span"": 218, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The RC group also correctly identified anger, fear, happiness, and surprise, more slowly than CN, but not OC participants.	[]
The OC group was slower than CN when correctly identifying disgust.	[]
The selective deficit in fear recognition accuracy manifested by the RC group cannot be explained by the subacute effects of cocaine, or ecstasy, because recent and less recent users of these drugs within this group were similarly impaired.

Additionally, in models of prolonged status epilepticus the pars reticulata of substantia nigra ( SNR) suffers from a massive lesion which may arise from a massive metabolic derangement and hyperexcitation developing in the activated SNR.

The neuropathology of SNR was investigated using immunohistochemical techniques with the major emphasis on the time - course of changes in neurons and astrocytes.	[]
Animals surviving 20, 30, 40, 60 min, 2, 3, 6 hours, 1, 2, and 3 days after induction of status epilepticus were perfusion - fixed, and brains processed for immunohistochemical staining of SNR.	"status epilepticus	89	107	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""status epilepticus"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Nissl - staining and antibodies against the neuron - specific calcium - binding protein, parvalbumin, served to detect neuronal damage in SNR.	"neuronal damage	119	134	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""neuronal damage"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Antibodies against the astroglia - specific cytoskeletal protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP), and against the glial calcium - binding protein, S - 100 protein, were used to assess the status of astrocytes.	[]
Immunohistochemical staining for serum - albumin and immunoglobulins in brain tissue was taken as indicator of blood - brain barrier disturbances and vasogenic edema formation.	"vasogenic edema	150	165	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""vasogenic edema"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 165, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Immunohistochemical staining indicated loss of GFAP - staining already at 30 min after induction of seizures in an oval focus situated in the center of SNR while sparing medial and lateral aspects.

At 1 h there was additional vacuolation in S - 100 protein staining.	[]
By 2 hours, parvalbumin - staining changed in the central SNR indicating neuronal damage, and Nissl - staining visualized some neuronal distortion.	"neuronal damage	73	88	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""neuronal damage"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Staining for serum - proteins occurred in a patchy manner throughout the forebrain during the first hours.	[]
By 6 h, vasogenic edema covered the lesioned SNR.

By 24 h, glial and neuronal markers indicated a massive lesion in the center of SNR.	[]
By 48 - 72 h, astrocytes surrounding the lesion increased in size, and polymorphic phagocytotic cells invaded the damaged area.	[]
In a further group of animals surviving 1 to 5 days, conventional paraffin - sections confirmed the neuronal and glial damage of SNR.	"damage of SNR	119	132	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""damage of SNR"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Additional pathology of similar quality was found in the globus pallidus.	[]
Since astrocytes were always damaged in parallel with neurons in SNR it is proposed that the anatomical and functional interrelationship between neurons and astrocytes is particularly tight in SNR.	[]
Both cell elements may suffer in common from metabolic disturbance and neurotransmitter dysfunction as occur during massive status epilepticus.

This study was designed to evaluate the alterations in offspring rat cerebellum induced by maternal exposure to carmustine - [ 1, 3 - bis ( 2 - chloroethyl) - 1 - nitrosoure] ( BCNU) and to investigate the effects of exogenous melatonin upon cerebellar BCNU - induced cortical dysplasia, using histological and biochemical analyses.

Pregnant Wistar rats were assigned to five groups: intact - control, saline - control, melatonin - treated, BCNU - exposed and BCNU - exposed plus melatonin.	[]
Rats were exposed to BCNU on embryonic day 15 and melatonin was given until delivery.	[]
Immuno / histochemistry and electron microscopy were carried out on the offspring cerebellum, and levels of malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase were determined.	[]
Histopathologically, typical findings were observed in the cerebella from the control groups, but the findings consistent with early embryonic development were noted in BCNU - exposed cortical dysplasia group.	"cortical dysplasia	184	202	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cortical dysplasia"", ""start_span"": 184, ""end_span"": 202, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
There was a marked increase in the number of TUNEL positive cells and nestin positive cells in BCNU - exposed group, but a decreased immunoreactivity to glial fibrillary acidic protein, synaptophysin and transforming growth factor beta1 was observed, indicating a delayed maturation, and melatonin significantly reversed these changes.	[]
Malondialdehyde level in BCNU - exposed group was higher than those in control groups and melatonin decreased malondialdehyde levels in BCNU group ( P < 0. 01), while there were no significant differences in the superoxide dismutase levels between these groups.	[]
These data suggest that exposure of animals to BCNU during pregnancy leads to delayed maturation of offspring cerebellum and melatonin protects the cerebellum against the effects of BCNU.	[]

In these HPMA copolymers, DOX was covalently bound via peptide linkages that were either non - biodegradable ( Gly - Gly) or degradable by lysosomal proteinases ( Gly - Phe - Leu - Gly).	[]
In addition, one biodegradable conjugate containing galactosamine was used; this residue was targeted to the liver.	[]
Over the first 3 weeks after the i. v. administration of free and polymer - bound DOX, all animals showed a transient reduction in body weight.	[]
However, the maximal reduction in body weight seen in animals that received polymer - bound DOX ( 4 mg / kg) was significantly lower than that observed in those that received free DOX ( 4 mg / kg) or a mixture of the unmodified parent HPMA copolymer and free DOX ( 4 mg / kg; P less than 0. 01).	[]
Throughout the study ( 20 weeks), deaths related to cardiotoxicity were observed only in animals that received either free DOX or the mixture of HPMA copolymer and free DOX; in these cases, histological investigations revealed marked changes in the heart that were consistent with DOX - induced cardiotoxicity.

Sequential measurements of cardiac output in surviving animals that received either free DOX or the mixture of HPMA copolymer and free DOX showed a reduction of approximately 30% in function beginning at the 4th week after drug administration.	[]
The heart rate in these animals was approximately 12% lower than that measured in age - matched control rats ( P less than 0. 05).	[]
Animals that were given the HPMA copolymer conjugates containing DOX exhibited no significant change in cardiac output throughout the study ( P less than 0. 05).	[]
In addition, no significant histological change was observed in the heart of animals that received DOX in the form of HPMA copolymer conjugates and were killed at the end of the study.	[]
However, these animals had shown a significant increase in heart rate beginning at 8 weeks after drug administration ( P less than 0. 01). ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)	[]

The decrease in VAS ratings was significant after 2 weeks of continuous application.	[]
Of the responders 72. 2% were still improved at the follow - up; only one - third of them had continued application irregularly.	[]
Treatment effect was not dependent on patient ' s age, duration or localization of PHN ( trigeminal involvement was excluded), sensory disturbance or pain character.

Treatment response was not correlated with the incidence, time - course or severity of capsaicin - induced burning.	[]
If confirmed in controlled trials, the long - term results of this open, non - randomized study might indicate that the analgesic effect of capsaicin in PHN is mediated by both interference with neuropeptide metabolism and morphological changes ( perhaps degeneration) of nociceptive afferents.

Myo - inositol - 1 - phosphate ( MIP) synthase inhibition: in - vivo study in rats.	[]
Lithium and valproate are the prototypic mood stabilizers and have diverse structures and targets.	[]
Both drugs influence inositol metabolism.	[]
Lithium inhibits IMPase and valproate inhibits MIP synthase.	[]

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 77 chronic hepatitis B patients who had not been treated with lamivudine were included in the study.	"chronic hepatitis B	36	55	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""chronic hepatitis B"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Serum samples from patients were tested by polymerase chain reaction - restriction fragment length polymorphism ( PCR - RFLP) for detection of YMDD motif mutants.	[]
All patients were also tested for liver enzymes, anti - HCV, HBeAg, and anti - HBe.	[]
RESULTS: Of the 77 patients enrolled in the study, 73% were male and 27% were female.	[]
Mean ALT and AST levels were 124. 4 + / - 73. 4 and 103. 1 + / - 81 IU / l, respectively.	[]
HBeAg was positive in 40% and anti - HBe in 60% of the patients.	[]
Anti - HCV was negative in all of them.	[]
YMDD motif mutants were not detected in any of the patients despite the liver enzyme levels and the presence of HBeAg or anti - HBe.	[]

In the present study, we describe the proinflammatory effects of bupivacaine on local prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2) production and cyclooxygenase ( COX) gene expression that increases postoperative pain in human subjects.	"postoperative pain	179	197	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""postoperative pain"", ""start_span"": 179, ""end_span"": 197, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
METHODS: Subjects ( n = 114) undergoing extraction of impacted third molars received either 2% lidocaine or 0. 5% bupivacaine before surgery and either rofecoxib 50 mg or placebo orally 90 min before surgery and for the following 48 h.	[]
Oral mucosal biopsies were taken before surgery and 48 h after surgery.	[]
After extraction, a microdialysis probe was placed at the surgical site for PGE2 and thromboxane B2 ( TXB2) measurements.	[]
RESULTS: The bupivacaine / rofecoxib group reported significantly less pain, as assessed by a visual analog scale, compared with the other three treatment groups over the first 4 h.	"pain	71	75	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""pain"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
However, the bupivacaine / placebo group reported significantly more pain at 24 h and PGE2 levels during the first 4 h were significantly higher than the other three treatment groups.	"pain	69	73	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""pain"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Moreover, bupivacaine significantly increased COX - 2 gene expression at 48 h as compared with the lidocaine / placebo group.	[]
Thromboxane levels were not significantly affected by any of the treatments, indicating that the effects seen were attributable to inhibition of COX - 2, but not COX - 1.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that bupivacaine stimulates COX - 2 gene expression after tissue injury, which is associated with higher PGE2 production and pain after the local anesthetic effect dissipates.

A role for nerve growth factor ( NGF) in contributing to increased voiding frequency and altered sensation from the urinary bladder has been suggested.	[]
Previous studies have examined the expression and regulation of tyrosine kinase receptors ( Trks) in micturition reflexes with urinary bladder inflammation.

The present studies examine the expression and regulation of another receptor known to bind NGF, p75 ( NTR), after various durations of bladder inflammation induced by cyclophosphamide ( CYP).

The number of p75 ( NTR) - immunoreactive ( - IR) cells in the lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia ( DRG) also increased ( P < or = 0. 05) with CYP - induced cystitis ( acute, intermediate, and chronic).

Retrograde dye - tracing techniques with Fastblue were used to identify presumptive bladder afferent cells in the lumbosacral DRG.	[]
In bladder afferent cells in DRG, p75 ( NTR) - IR was also increased ( P < or = 0. 01) with cystitis.	"cystitis	92	100	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cystitis"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In addition to increases in p75 ( NTR) - IR in DRG cell bodies, increases ( P < or = 0. 001) in pericellular ( encircling DRG cells) p75 ( NTR) - IR in DRG also increased.	[]
Confocal analyses demonstrated that pericellular p75 ( NTR) - IR was not colocalized with the glial marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP).	[]
These studies demonstrate that p75 ( NTR) expression in micturition reflexes is present constitutively and modified by bladder inflammation.

Azathioprine - induced suicidal erythrocyte death.	[]
BACKGROUND: Azathioprine is widely used as an immunosuppressive drug.	[]
The side effects of azathioprine include anemia, which has been attributed to bone marrow suppression.	"anemia	41	47	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""anemia"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Alternatively, anemia could result from accelerated suicidal erythrocyte death or eryptosis, which is characterized by exposure of phosphatidylserine ( PS) at the erythrocyte surface and by cell shrinkage.	"anemia	15	21	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""anemia"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
METHODS: The present experiments explored whether azathioprine influences eryptosis.	[]
According to annexin V binding, erythrocytes from patients indeed showed a significant increase of PS exposure within 1 week of treatment with azathioprine.	[]
In a second series, cytosolic Ca2 + activity ( Fluo3 fluorescence), cell volume ( forward scatter), and PS - exposure ( annexin V binding) were determined by FACS analysis in erythrocytes from healthy volunteers.	[]
RESULTS: Exposure to azathioprine ( > or = 2 microg / mL) for 48 hours increased cytosolic Ca2 + activity and annexin V binding and decreased forward scatter.	[]
The effect of azathioprine on both annexin V binding and forward scatter was significantly blunted in the nominal absence of extracellular Ca2 +.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: Azathioprine triggers suicidal erythrocyte death, an effect presumably contributing to azathioprine - induced anemia.	"anemia	123	129	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""anemia"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Complicated depressive disorders ( including atypicality of course and symptomatology, chronicity, psychosis, bipolarity, and secondary onset in the course of a primary psychosis) may present particular vulnerability to paranoid exacerbations associated with serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

Although the pharmacology and neurobiology of paranoia remain cryptic, several mechanisms, including 5HT3 receptor - mediated dopamine release, beta - noradrenergic receptor downregulation, or GABAB receptor upregulation acting in the vicinity of the ventral basal ganglia ( possibly in lateral orbitofrontal or anterior cingulate circuits), might apply to this phenomenon.

METHODS: With ethical approval, we studied 74 American Society of Anesthesiologists ( ASA), physical status class 1 and 2 patients scheduled for elective unilateral lower limb surgery.	[]
Patients were randomly allocated into one of two groups: lateral and conventional spinal anaesthesia groups.	[]
In the lateral position with operative side down, patients recived 10 mg ( 2mls) of 0. 5% hyperbaric bupivacaine through a 25 - gauge spinal needle.	[]
Patients in the unilateral group were maintained in the lateral position for 15 minutes following spinal injection while those in the conventional group were turned supine immediately after injection.	[]
Blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation were monitored over 1 hour.	[]
RESULTS: Three patients ( 8. 1%) in the unilateral group and 5 ( 13. 5%) in the conventional group developed hypotension, P = 0. 71.	"hypotension	109	120	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hypotension"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Four ( 10. 8%) patients in the conventional group and 1 ( 2. 7%) in the unilateral group, P = 0. 17 required epinephrine infusion to treat hypotension.	"hypotension	139	150	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hypotension"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Patients in the conventional group had statistically significant greater fall in the systolic blood pressures at 15, 30 and 45 minutes when compared to the baseline ( P = 0. 003, 0. 001 and 0. 004).	[]
The mean respiratory rate and oxygen saturations in the two groups were similar.	[]
CONCLUSION: Compared to conventional spinal anaesthesia, unilateral spinal anaesthesia was associated with fewer cardiovascular perturbations.	[]
Also, the type of spinal block instituted affected neither the respiratory rate nor the arterial oxygen saturation.	[]

Sural nerve SAP amplitude reduction > or = 40% was the criteria for discontinuing therapy.	[]
RESULTS: During treatment, 11 patients showed a reduction in sural nerve SAP amplitude compared to baseline values ( 9 with a reduction > or = 50% and 2 < 50%).	[]
One patient showed no changes in SAP amplitude.	[]
Five patients complained of paresthesias and leg cramps.	"paresthesias	28	40	Disease/Disorder"	"cramps	49	55	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""paresthesias"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""cramps"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
After thalidomide treatment, sural SAP amplitude recovered in 3 patients.	[]
At detection of reduction in sural nerve SAP amplitude, the median thalidomide cumulative dose was 21. 4 g.	[]
The threshold neurotoxic dosage is lower than previously reported.	"neurotoxic	14	24	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""neurotoxic"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
CONCLUSIONS: Sural nerve SAP amplitude reduction is a reliable and sensitive marker of degeneration and recovery of sensory fibres.	[]
This electrophysiological parameter provides information about subclinical neurotoxic potential of thalidomide but is not helpful in predicting the appearance of sensory symptoms.

Two cases had a fatal outcome and one resulted in severe sequelae.	[]
The notable fact was that this complication occurred in three patients hospitalized before treatment began, with whom particularly strict therapeutic precautions were taken, i. e., initial dose less than 10 mg of DEC, very gradual dose increases, and associated anti - allergic treatment.	[]
This type of drug - induced complication may not be that uncommon in highly endemic regions.	[]
It occurs primarily, but not exclusively, in subjects presenting with a high microfilarial load.	[]

The hazard decreased 0. 3 - fold ( 0. 7 - 1. 7, P = 0. 385) with glimepiride, 0. 4 - fold ( 0. 7 - 1. 3, P = 0. 192) with gliclazide, and 0. 4 - fold ( 0. 7 - 1. 1, P = 0. 09) with either.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: Initiating treatment of type 2 diabetes with glibenclamide or glipizide is associated with increased risk of CAD in comparison to gliclazide or glimepiride.

The risks of aprotinin and tranexamic acid in cardiac surgery: a one - year follow - up of 1188 consecutive patients.	[]
BACKGROUND: Our aim was to investigate postoperative complications and mortality after administration of aprotinin compared to tranexamic acid in an unselected, consecutive cohort.	[]
METHODS: Perioperative data from consecutive cardiac surgery patients were prospectively collected between September 2005 and June 2006 in a university - affiliated clinic ( n = 1188).	[]
During the first 5 mo, 596 patients received aprotinin ( Group A); in the next 5 mo, 592 patients were treated with tranexamic acid ( Group T).	[]
Except for antifibrinolytic therapy, the anesthetic and surgical protocols remained unchanged.	[]
RESULTS: The pre - and intraoperative variables were comparable between the treatment groups.	[]

Motor impairment, dopamine ( DA) neuronal activity and proenkephalin ( PENK) gene expression in the caudate - putamen ( CPu) were measured in 6 - OHDA - lesioned and treated ( L - DOPA + benserazide) CB1 KO and WT mice.	[]
A lesion induced by 6 - OHDA produced more severe motor deterioration in CB1 KO mice accompanied by more loss of DA neurons and increased PENK gene expression in the CPu.	[]
Oxidative / nitrosative and neuroinflammatory parameters were estimated in the CPu and cingulate cortex ( Cg).	[]
CB1 KO mice exhibited higher MDA levels and iNOS protein expression in the CPu and Cg compared to WT mice.	[]
Treatment with L - DOPA + benserazide ( 12 weeks) resulted in less severe dyskinesias in CB1 KO than in WT mice.	"dyskinesias	74	85	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""dyskinesias"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Oxidized glutathione ( GSSG) increased significantly following 30 and 60 min of reperfusion.	[]
There was no increase in any of the products of lipid peroxidation associated with this injury.	[]
An increase in GSSG within hepatic tissue during intestinal reperfusion suggests exposure of hepatocytes to an oxidant stress.	[]
The lack of a significant increase in products of lipid peroxidation suggests that the oxidant stress is of insufficient magnitude to result in irreversible injury to hepatocyte cell membranes.	[]
These data also suggest that the measurement of tissue GSSG may be a more sensitive indicator of oxidant stress than measurement of products of lipid peroxidation.	[]

To achieve this aim, the effects of ouabain injection immediately after and 7 days following a single ICV administration ( at concentrations of 10 ( - 2) and 10 ( - 3) M) on locomotion was measured using the open - field test.	[]
Additionally, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances ( TBARSs) and superoxide production were measured in submitochondrial particles of the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and amygdala.	[]
Our findings demonstrated that ouabain at 10 ( - 2) and 10 ( - 3) M induced hyperlocomotion in rats, and this response remained up to 7 days following a single ICV injection.

[]
To determine whether the risk of HIV seroconversion among daily smokers of crack cocaine changed over time, we used Cox proportional hazards regression and divided the study into 3 periods: May 1, 1996 - Nov.

The mean proportion of participants who reported daily smoking of crack cocaine increased from 11. 6% in period 1 to 39. 7% in period 3.	[]
After adjusting for potential confounders, we found that the risk of HIV seroconversion among participants who were daily smokers of crack cocaine increased over time ( period 1: hazard ratio [ HR] 1. 03, 95% confidence interval [ CI] 0. 57 - 1. 85; period 2: HR 1. 68, 95% CI 1. 01 - 2. 80; and period 3: HR 2. 74, 95% CI 1. 06 - 7. 11).

A widely used chemotherapeutic agent, 5 - fluorouracil ( 5 - FU), readily crosses the blood - brain barrier and so could have a direct effect on brain function.	[]
In particular this anti mitotic drug could reduce cell proliferation in the neurogenic regions of the adult brain.	[]
In contrast reports indicate that hippocampal dependent neurogenesis and cognition are enhanced by the SSRI antidepressant Fluoxetine.	[]
In this investigation the behavioural effects of chronic ( two week) treatment with 5 - FU and ( three weeks) with Fluoxetine either separately or in combination with 5 - FU were tested on adult Lister hooded rats.	[]
Behavioural effects were tested using a context dependent conditioned emotional response test ( CER) which showed that animals treated with 5 - FU had a significant reduction in freezing time compared to controls.	[]
A separate group of animals was tested using a hippocampal dependent spatial working memory test, the object location recognition test ( OLR).	[]
Animals treated only with 5 - FU showed significant deficits in their ability to carry out the OLR task but co administration of Fluoxetine improved their performance.	[]
5 - FU chemotherapy caused a significant reduction in the number of proliferating cells in the sub granular zone of the dentate gyrus compared to controls.	[]
This reduction was eliminated when Fluoxetine was co administered with 5 - FU.	[]
Fluoxetine on its own had no effect on proliferating cell number or behaviour.	[]
These findings suggest that 5 - FU can negatively affect both cell proliferation and hippocampal dependent working memory and that these deficits can be reversed by the simultaneous administration of the antidepressant Fluoxetine.	[]
Liver - specific ablation of integrin - linked kinase in mice results in enhanced and prolonged cell proliferation and hepatomegaly after phenobarbital administration.

We have recently demonstrated that disruption of extracellular matrix ( ECM) / integrin signaling via elimination of integrin - linked kinase ( ILK) in hepatocytes interferes with signals leading to termination of liver regeneration.	[]
This study investigates the role of ILK in liver enlargement induced by phenobarbital ( PB).	[]
Wild - type ( WT) and ILK: liver - / - mice were given PB ( 0. 1% in drinking water) for 10 days.	[]
Livers were harvested on 2, 5, and 10 days during PB administration.	[]
In the hepatocyte - specific ILK / liver - / - mice, the liver: body weight ratio was more than double as compared to 0 h at day 2 ( 2. 5 times), while at days 5 and 10, it was enlarged three times.	[]
In the WT mice, the increase was as expected from previous literature ( 1. 8 times) and seems to have leveled off after day 2.	[]
There were slightly increased proliferating cell nuclear antigen - positive cells in the ILK / liver - / - animals at day 2 as compared to WT after PB administration.	[]
In the WT animals, the proliferative response had come back to normal by days 5 and 10.	[]
Hepatocytes of the ILK / liver - / - mice continued to proliferate up until day 10.	[]
ILK / liver - / - mice also showed increased expression of key genes involved in hepatocyte proliferation at different time points during PB administration.	[]
In summary, ECM proteins communicate with the signaling machinery of dividing cells via ILK to regulate hepatocyte proliferation and termination of the proliferative response.	[]
Lack of ILK in the hepatocytes imparts prolonged proliferative response not only to stimuli related to liver regeneration but also to xenobiotic chemical mitogens, such as PB.	[]

Sprague - Dawley male rats ( 200 ~ 250 g) were subcutaneously injected with gentamicin ( 100 mg / kg per day) for 7 days, and the expression of tubular transporters was determined by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry.	[]
The mRNA and protein expression of OAT was also determined.	[]
Gentamicin - treated rats exhibited significantly decreased creatinine clearance along with increased plasma creatinine levels.	[]
Accordingly, the fractional excretion of sodium increased.	[]
Urine volume was increased, while urine osmolality and free water reabsorption were decreased.	[]
Immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry revealed decreased expression of Na ( +) / K ( +) - ATPase, NHE3, NBC1, and AQP1 in the kidney of gentamicin - treated rats.	[]
The expression of OAT1 and OAT3 was also decreased.	[]
Gentamicin - induced nephropathy may at least in part be causally related with a decreased expression of Na ( +) / K ( +) - ATPase, NHE3, NBC1, AQP1 and OAT.	"nephropathy	21	32	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""nephropathy"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Metallothionein induction reduces caspase - 3 activity and TNFalpha levels with preservation of cognitive function and intact hippocampal neurons in carmustine - treated rats.	[]
Hippocampal integrity is essential for cognitive functions.	[]
On the other hand, induction of metallothionein ( MT) by ZnSO ( 4) and its role in neuroprotection has been documented.	[]
The present study aimed to explore the effect of MT induction on carmustine ( BCNU) - induced hippocampal cognitive dysfunction in rats.

A total of 60 male Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into four groups ( 15 / group): The control group injected with single doses of normal saline ( i. c. v) followed 24 h later by BCNU solvent ( i. v).	[]
The second group administered ZnSO ( 4) ( 0. 1 micromol / 10 microl normal saline, i. c. v, once) then BCNU solvent ( i. v) after 24 h.	[]
Third group received BCNU ( 20 mg / kg, i. v, once) 24 h after injection with normal saline ( i. c. v).	[]
Fourth group received a single dose of ZnSO ( 4) ( 0. 1 micromol / 10 microl normal saline, i. c. v) then BCNU ( 20 mg / kg, i. v, once) after 24 h.	[]
The obtained data revealed that BCNU administration resulted in deterioration of learning and short - term memory ( STM), as measured by using radial arm water maze, accompanied with decreased hippocampal glutathione reductase ( GR) activity and reduced glutathione ( GSH) content.	"deterioration of learning and short - term memory	64	113	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""deterioration of learning and short - term memory"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Also, BCNU administration increased serum tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( TNFalpha), hippocampal MT and malondialdehyde ( MDA) contents as well as caspase - 3 activity in addition to histological alterations.	"tumor	42	47	Disease/Disorder"	"necrosis	48	56	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumor"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""necrosis"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
ZnSO ( 4) pretreatment counteracted BCNU - induced inhibition of GR and depletion of GSH and resulted in significant reduction in the levels of MDA and TNFalpha as well as the activity of caspase - 3.	[]
The histological features were improved in hippocampus of rats treated with ZnSO ( 4) + BCNU compared to only BCNU - treated animals.	[]
In conclusion, MT induction halts BCNU - induced hippocampal toxicity as it prevented GR inhibition and GSH depletion and counteracted the increased levels of TNFalpha, MDA and caspase - 3 activity with subsequent preservation of cognition.

BACKGROUND: Renal dysfunction induced by iodinated contrast medium ( CM) administration can minimize the benefit of the interventional procedure in patients undergoing renal angioplasty ( PTRA).	"Renal dysfunction	12	29	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Renal dysfunction"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
PURPOSE: To compare the susceptibility to nephrotoxic effect of CM in patients undergoing PTRA with that of patients submitted to percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 33 patients successfully treated with PTRA ( PTRA group, mean age 70 + / - 12 years, 23 female, basal creatinine 1. 46 + / - 0. 79, range 0. 7 - 4. 9 mg / dl) were compared with 33 patients undergoing successful PCI ( PCI group), matched for basal creatinine ( 1. 44 + / - 0. 6, range 0. 7 - 3. 4 mg / dl), gender, and age.	[]
In both groups postprocedural ( 48 h) serum creatinine was measured.	[]
RESULTS: Postprocedural creatinine level decreased nonsignificantly in the PTRA group ( 1. 46 + / - 0. 8 vs. 1. 34 + / - 0. 5 mg / dl, P = NS) and increased significantly in the PCI group ( 1. 44 + / - 0. 6 vs. 1. 57 + / - 0. 7 mg / dl, P < 0. 02).	[]
Changes in serum creatinine after intervention ( after - before) were significantly different between the PTRA and PCI groups ( - 0. 12 + / - 0. 5 vs. 0. 13 + / - 0. 3, P = 0. 014).	[]
This difference was not related to either a different clinical risk profile or to the volume of CM administered.	[]
CONCLUSION: In this preliminary study patients submitted to PTRA showed a lower susceptibility to renal damage induced by CM administration than PCI patients.

Diphenhydramine prevents the haemodynamic changes of cimetidine in ICU patients.	[]
Cimetidine, a histamine 2 ( H2) antagonist, produces a decrease in arterial pressure due to vasodilatation, especially in critically ill patients.	[]
This may be because cimetidine acts as a histamine agonist.	[]
We, therefore, investigated the effects of the histamine 1 ( H1) receptor antagonist, diphenhydramine, on the haemodynamic changes observed after cimetidine in ICU patients.	[]
Each patient was studied on two separate days.	[]
In a random fashion, they received cimetidine 200 mg iv on one day, and on the other, a pretreatment of diphenhydramine 40 mg iv with cimetidine 200 mg iv.	[]
In the non - pretreatment group, mean arterial pressure ( MAP) decreased from 107. 4 + / - 8. 4 mmHg to 86. 7 + / - 11. 4 mmHg ( P less than 0. 01) two minutes after cimetidine.	[]
Also, systemic vascular resistance ( SVR) decreased during the eight - minute observation period ( P less than 0. 01).	[]
In contrast, in the pretreatment group, little haemodynamic change was seen.	[]
We conclude that an H1 antagonist may be useful in preventing hypotension caused by iv cimetidine, since the vasodilating activity of cimetidine is mediated, in part, through the H1 receptor.

There was also an excess of MB in warfarin users vs nonusers with ICH ( OR, 2. 7; 95% CI, 1. 6 - 4. 4; P < 0. 001) but none in warfarin users with IS / TIA ( OR, 1. 3; 95% CI, 0. 9 - 1. 7; P = 0. 33; P difference = 0. 01).

There was a smaller excess of MB in antiplatelet users vs nonusers with ICH ( OR, 1. 7; 95% CI, 1. 3 - 2. 3; P < 0. 001), but findings were similar for antiplatelet users with IS / TIA ( OR, 1. 4; 95% CI, 1. 2 - 1. 7; P < 0. 001; P difference = 0. 25).	"MB	30	32	Disease/Disorder"	"ICH	72	75	Disease/Disorder"	"IS	176	178	Disease/Disorder"	"TIA	181	184	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""MB"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""ICH"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""IS"", ""start_span"": 176, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""TIA"", ""start_span"": 181, ""end_span"": 184, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In pooled follow - up data for 768 antithrombotic users, presence of MB at baseline was associated with a substantially increased risk of subsequent ICH ( OR, 12. 1; 95% CI, 3. 4 - 42. 5; P < 0. 001).	"MB	69	71	Disease/Disorder"	"ICH	149	152	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""MB"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""ICH"", ""start_span"": 149, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
CONCLUSIONS: The excess of MB in warfarin users with ICH compared to other groups suggests that MB increase the risk of warfarin - associated ICH.	"MB	27	29	Disease/Disorder"	"ICH	53	56	Disease/Disorder"	"MB	27	29	Disease/Disorder"	"ICH	53	56	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""MB"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""ICH"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""MB"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""ICH"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Studies of synergy between morphine and a novel sodium channel blocker, CNSB002, in rat models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain.	"neuropathic pain	115	131	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""neuropathic pain"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
OBJECTIVE: This study determined the antihyperalgesic effect of CNSB002, a sodium channel blocker with antioxidant properties given alone and in combinations with morphine in rat models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain.	"neuropathic pain	206	222	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""neuropathic pain"", ""start_span"": 206, ""end_span"": 222, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
DESIGN: Dose response curves for nonsedating doses of morphine and CNSB002 given intraperitoneally alone and together in combinations were constructed for antihyperalgesic effect using paw withdrawal from noxious heat in two rat pain models: carrageenan - induced paw inflammation and streptozotocin ( STZ) - induced diabetic neuropathy.

RESULTS: The maximum nonsedating doses were: morphine, 3. 2 mg / kg; CNSB002 10. 0 mg / kg; 5. 0 mg / kg CNSB002 with morphine 3. 2 mg / kg in combination.	[]
The doses calculated to cause 50% reversal of hyperalgesia ( ED50) were 7. 54 ( 1. 81) and 4. 83 ( 1. 54) in the carrageenan model and 44. 18 ( 1. 37) and 9. 14 ( 1. 24) in the STZ - induced neuropathy model for CNSB002 and morphine, respectively ( mg / kg; mean, SEM).

These values were greater than the maximum nonsedating doses.	[]
The ED50 values for morphine when given in combination with CNSB002 ( 5 mg / kg) were less than the maximum nonsedating dose: 0. 56 ( 1. 55) in the carrageenan model and 1. 37 ( 1. 23) in the neuropathy model ( mg / kg; mean, SEM).

The antinociception after morphine ( 3. 2 mg / kg) was increased by co - administration with CNSB002 from 28. 0 and 31. 7% to 114. 6 and 56. 9% reversal of hyperalgesia in the inflammatory and neuropathic models, respectively ( P < 0. 01; one - way analysis of variance - significantly greater than either drug given alone).

It begins when heparin exposure stimulates the formation of heparin - platelet factor 4 antibodies, which in turn triggers the release of procoagulant platelet particles.	[]
Thrombosis and thrombocytopenia that follow comprise the 2 hallmark traits of HIT, with the former largely responsible for significant vascular complications.

HIT must be acknowledged for its intense predilection for thrombosis and suspected whenever thrombosis occurs after heparin exposure.

Early recognition that incorporates the clinical and serologic clues is paramount to timely institution of treatment, as its delay may result in catastrophic outcomes.	[]
The treatment of HIT mandates an immediate cessation of all heparin exposure and the institution of an antithrombotic therapy, most commonly using a direct thrombin inhibitor.

Special attention must be paid to cardiac patients who are often exposed to heparin multiple times during their course of treatment.	[]
Direct thrombin inhibitors are appropriate, evidence - based alternatives to heparin in patients with a history of HIT, who need to undergo percutaneous coronary intervention.

As heparin remains one of the most frequently used medications today with potential for HIT with every heparin exposure, a close vigilance of platelet counts must be practiced whenever heparin is initiated.

Seven days of cocaine administration to rats led to an increased oxygen consumption detected in cardiac fibers, specifically through complex I and complex III.	[]
ROS levels were increased, specifically in interfibrillar mitochondria.	[]
In parallel there was a decrease in ATP synthesis, whereas no difference was observed in subsarcolemmal mitochondria.	[]
This uncoupling effect on oxidative phosphorylation was not detectable after short - term exposure to cocaine, suggesting that these mitochondrial abnormalities were a late rather than a primary event in the pathological response to cocaine.

Patients become progressively refractory to conventional chemotherapy, and their prognosis is poor.	[]
However, a 38% remission rate has been recently reported in refractory MCL treated with temsirolimus, a mTOR inhibitor. Here we had the opportunity to study a case of refractory MCL who had tumor regression two months after temsirolimus treatment, and a progression - free survival of 10 months.	"MCL	71	74	Disease/Disorder"	"MCL	71	74	Disease/Disorder"	"tumor	190	195	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""MCL"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""MCL"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""tumor"", ""start_span"": 190, ""end_span"": 195, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In this case, lymph node biopsies were performed before and six months after temsirolimus therapy.	[]
Comparison of the two biopsies showed that temsirolimus inhibited tumor cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest, but did not induce any change in the number of apoptotic tumor cells.

Apart from this cytostatic effect, temsirolimus had an antiangiogenic effect with decrease of tumor microvessel density and of VEGF expression.	"tumor	94	99	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumor"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

The administration of L - arginine ( 600, 800 and 1000 mg / kg, i. p.) in dose - dependent manner significantly increased convulsion incidence and severity and shortened latency time to first convulsion elicited by lower lindane dose ( 4 mg / kg, i. p.).

Effects of cromakalim and pinacidil on large epicardial and small coronary arteries in conscious dogs.	[]
The effects of i. v. bolus administration of cromakalim ( 1 - 10 micrograms / kg) and pinacidil ( 3 - 100 micrograms / kg) on large ( circumflex artery) and small coronary arteries and on systemic hemodynamics were investigated in chronically instrumented conscious dogs and compared to those of nitroglycerin ( 0. 03 - 10 micrograms / kg).	[]
Nitroglycerin, up to 0. 3 micrograms / kg, selectively increased circumflex artery diameter ( CxAD) without simultaneously affecting any other cardiac or systemic hemodynamic parameter.	[]
In contrast, cromakalim and pinacidil at all doses and nitroglycerin at doses higher than 0. 3 micrograms / kg simultaneously and dose - dependently increased CxAD, coronary blood flow and heart rate and decreased coronary vascular resistance and aortic pressure.	[]
Cromakalim was approximately 8 - to 9. 5 - fold more potent than pinacidil in increasing CxAD.	[]
Vasodilation of large and small coronary vessels and hypotension induced by cromakalim and pinacidil were not affected by prior combined beta adrenergic and muscarinic receptors blockade but drug - induced tachycardia was abolished.

When circumflex artery blood flow was maintained constant, the increases in CxAD induced by cromakalim ( 10 micrograms / kg), pinacidil ( 30 micrograms / kg) and nitroglycerin ( 10 micrograms / kg) were reduced by 68 + / - 7, 54 + / - 9 and 1 + / - 1%, respectively.	[]
Thus, whereas nitroglycerin preferentially and flow - independently dilates large coronary arteries, cromakalim and pinacidil dilate both large and small coronary arteries and this effect is not dependent upon the simultaneous beta adrenoceptors - mediated rise in myocardial metabolic demand.	[]
Finally, two mechanisms at least, direct vasodilation and flow dependency, are involved in the cromakalim - and pinacidil - induced increase in CxAD.	[]

We recently reported in young healthy subjects that inhibitory cerebellar stimulation enhanced the sensorimotor plasticity of M1 that was induced by paired associative stimulation ( PAS).	[]
This study demonstrates that the deficient sensorimotor M1 plasticity in 16 patients with LIDs could be reinstated by a single session of real inhibitory cerebellar stimulation but not sham stimulation.	"LIDs	90	94	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""LIDs"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
This was evident only when a sensory component was involved in the induction of plasticity, indicating that cerebellar sensory processing function is involved in the resurgence of M1 plasticity.	[]
The benefit of inhibitory cerebellar stimulation on LIDs is known.	"LIDs	52	56	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""LIDs"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
To explore whether this benefit is linked to the restoration of sensorimotor plasticity of M1, we conducted an additional study looking at changes in LIDs and PAS - induced plasticity after 10 sessions of either bilateral, real inhibitory cerebellar stimulation or sham stimulation.	"LIDs	150	154	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""LIDs"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Only real and not sham stimulation had an antidyskinetic effect and it was paralleled by a resurgence in the sensorimotor plasticity of M1.	[]
These results suggest that alterations in cerebellar sensory processing function, occurring secondary to abnormal basal ganglia signals reaching it, may be an important element contributing to the maladaptive sensorimotor plasticity of M1 and the emergence of abnormal involuntary movements.

This study compared various concentrations of CHP to determine if a tolerable concentration could be identified with retention of antimicrobial efficacy.	[]
Twenty - nine burn patients, each with two similar burns which could be separately treated, were given pairs of treatments at successive 12 - h intervals over a 3 - day period.

"cardiotoxicity	131	145	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cardiotoxicity"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol ( 30 mg / kg) into rats twice at an interval of 24 h, for two consecutive days, led to a significant increase in serum lactate dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and angiotensin - converting enzyme activities, total cholesterol, triglycerides, free serum fatty acid, cardiac tissue malondialdehyde ( MDA), and nitric oxide levels and a significant decrease in levels of glutathione and superoxide dismutase in cardiac tissue as compared to the normal control group ( P < 0. 05).	[]
Pretreatment with S. virgaurea extract for 5 weeks at a dose of 250 mg / kg followed by isoproterenol injection significantly prevented the observed alterations.	[]
Captopril ( 50 mg / kg / day, given orally), an inhibitor of angiotensin - converting enzyme used as a standard cardioprotective drug, was used as a positive control in this study.	[]
The data of the present study suggest that S. virgaurea extract exerts its protective effect by decreasing MDA level and increasing the antioxidant status in isoproterenol - treated rats.	[]
The study emphasizes the beneficial action of S. virgaurea extract as a cardioprotective agent.	[]

This side effect of IFO raises the requirement for the co - administration with sodium 2 - sulfanylethanesulfonate ( Mesna) aiming to avoid or minimize this effect.	[]
IFO and Mesna were administrated separately on rabbit ' s lymphocytes in vivo, which were later developed in vitro.	[]
Cytogenetic markers for sister chromatid exchanges ( SCEs), proliferation rate index ( PRI) and Mitotic Index were recorded.	[]
Mesna ' s action, in conjunction with IFO reduces the frequency of SCEs, in comparison with the SCEs recordings obtained when IFO is administered alone.	[]
In addition to this, when high concentrations of Mesna were administered alone significant reductions of the PRI were noted, than with IFO acting at the same concentration on the lymphocytes.	[]

Methamphetamine ( METH) triggers a disruption of the monoaminergic system and METH abuse leads to negative emotional states including depressive symptoms during drug withdrawal.	"depressive symptoms	134	153	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""depressive symptoms"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
However, it is currently unknown if the acute toxic dosage of METH also causes a long - lasting depressive phenotype and persistent monoaminergic deficits.	"depressive	96	106	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""depressive"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Thus, we now assessed the depressive - like behaviour in mice at early and long - term periods following a single high METH dose ( 30 mg / kg, i. p.).	"depressive	26	36	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""depressive"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
METH did not alter the motor function and procedural memory of mice as assessed by swimming speed and escape latency to find the platform in a cued version of the water maze task.	[]
However, METH significantly increased the immobility time in the tail suspension test at 3 and 49 days post - administration.	[]
This depressive - like profile induced by METH was accompanied by a marked depletion of frontostriatal dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission, indicated by a reduction in the levels of dopamine, DOPAC and HVA, tyrosine hydroxylase and serotonin, observed at both 3 and 49 days post - administration.	"depressive	5	15	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""depressive"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In parallel, another neurochemical feature of depression - - astroglial dysfunction - - was unaffected in the cortex and the striatal levels of the astrocytic protein marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein, were only transiently increased at 3 days.	"depression	46	56	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""depression"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Piglets were then randomly allocated to four groups: control ( saline), Intralipid () alone, epinephrine alone, or a combination of Intralipd plus epinephrine.	[]
Resuscitation continued for 30 min or until there was a return of spontaneous circulation ( ROSC) accompanied by a mean arterial pressure at or superior to the baseline pressure and normal sinus rhythm for a period of 30 min.	[]
RESULTS: ROSC was achieved in only one of the control piglets compared with most of the treated piglets.	[]
Mortality was not significantly different between the three treatment groups, but was significantly lower in all the treatment groups compared with control.	[]
The number of ECG abnormalities was zero in the Intralipid only group, but 14 and 17, respectively, in the epinephrine and epinephrine plus lipid groups ( P < 0. 05).	[]
CONCLUSIONS: Lipid emulsion with or without epinephrine, or epinephrine alone were equally effective in achieving a return to spontaneous circulation in this model of LAST.	[]
Epinephrine alone or in combination with lipid was associated with an increased number of ECG abnormalities compared with lipid emulsion alone.	[]

Strikingly, despite prolonged abstinence ( mean, 4. 98; range, 4 - 9 years), past ecstasy users showed few signs of recovery.	[]
Compared with present ecstasy users, the past users showed no change for ten measures, increased impairment for two measures, and improvement on just one measure.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: Given this record of impaired memory and clinically significant levels of depression, impulsiveness, and sleep disturbance, the prognosis for the current generation of ecstasy users is a major cause for concern.

Crocin improves lipid dysregulation in subacute diazinon exposure through ERK1 / 2 pathway in rat liver.	[]
INTRODUCTION: Diazinon Yis one of the most broadly used organophosphorus insecticides in agriculture.	[]
It has been shown that exposure to diazinon may interfere with lipid metabolism.	[]
Moreover, the hypolipidemic effect of crocin has been established.	[]
Earlier studies revealed the major role of Extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( ERK) pathways in low - density lipoprotein receptor ( LDLr) expression.	[]
The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in the regulation of lipid metabolism, ERK and LDLr expression in the liver of rats exposed to subacute diazinon.	[]
Furthermore ameliorating effect of crocin on diazinon induced disturbed cholesterol homeostasis was studied.	[]
METHODS: 24 Rats were divided into 4 groups and received following treatments for 4 weeks; Corn oil ( control), diazinon ( 15mg / kg per day, orally) and crocin ( 12. 5 and 25mg / kg per day, intraperitoneally) in combination with diazinon ( 15 mg / kg).	[]
The levels of cholesterol, triglyceride and LDL in blood of rats were analyzed.	[]
Moreover mRNA levels of LDLr and ERK1 / 2 as well as protein levels of total and activated forms of ERK1 / 2 in rat liver were evaluated by Western blotting and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction analysis.	[]
RESULTS: Our data showed that subacute exposure to diazinon significantly increased concentrations of cholesterol, triglyceride and LDL.	[]
Moreover diazinon decreased ERK1 / 2 protein phosphorylation and LDLr transcript.	[]
Crocin reduced inhibition of ERK activation and diazinon - induced hyperlipemia and increased levels of LDLr transcript.	"hyperlipemia	67	79	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hyperlipemia"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

OBJECTIVES: The current study is the first to explore the effects of ecstasy - polydrug use on psychological distress and basal functioning of the HPA axis through assessing the secretion of cortisol across the diurnal period.	[]
METHOD: Seventy - six participants ( 21 nonusers, 29 light ecstasy - polydrug users, 26 heavy ecstasy - polydrug users) completed a substance use inventory and measures of psychological distress at baseline, then two consecutive days of cortisol sampling ( on awakening, 30 min post awakening, between 1400 and 1600 hours and pre bedtime).	[]
On day 2, participants also attended the laboratory to complete a 20 - min multitasking stressor.	[]
RESULTS: Both user groups exhibited significantly greater levels of anxiety and depression than nonusers.

On day 1, all participants exhibited a typical cortisol profile, though light users had significantly elevated levels pre - bed.	[]
On day 2, heavy users demonstrated elevated levels upon awakening and all ecstasy - polydrug users demonstrated elevated pre - bed levels compared to non - users.	[]
Significant between group differences were also observed in afternoon cortisol levels and in overall cortisol secretion across the day.	[]

The flavonoid apigenin delays forgetting of passive avoidance conditioning in rats.	[]
The present experiments were performed to study the effect of the flavonoid apigenin ( 20 mg / kg intraperitoneally ( i. p.), 1 h before acquisition), on 24 h retention performance and forgetting of a step - through passive avoidance task, in young male Wistar rats.	[]
There were no differences between saline - and apigenin - treated groups in the 24 h retention trial.	[]
Furthermore, apigenin did not prevent the amnesia induced by scopolamine ( 1mg / kg, i. p., 30 min before the acquisition).	"amnesia	42	49	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""amnesia"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The saline - and apigenin - treated rats that did not step through into the dark compartment during the cut - off time ( 540 s) were retested weekly for up to eight weeks.	[]
In the saline treated group, the first significant decline in passive avoidance response was observed at four weeks, and complete memory loss was found five weeks after the acquisition of the passive avoidance task.	"memory loss	130	141	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""memory loss"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
At the end of the experimental period, 60% of the animals treated with apigenin still did not step through.	[]
These data suggest that 1) apigenin delays the long - term forgetting but did not modulate the 24 h retention of fear memory and 2) the obtained beneficial effect of apigenin on the passive avoidance conditioning is mediated by mechanisms that do not implicate its action on the muscarinic cholinergic system.

Histamine antagonists and d - tubocurarine - induced hypotension in cardiac surgical patients.	"hypotension	53	64	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hypotension"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Hemodynamic effects and histamine release by bolus injection of 0. 35 mg / kg of d - tubocurarine were studied in 24 patients.	[]
H1 - and H2 - histamine antagonists or placebo were given before dosing with d - tubocurarine in a randomized double - blind fashion to four groups: group 1 - - placebo; group 2 - - cimetidine, 4 mg / kg, plus placebo; group 3 - - chlorpheniramine, 0. 1 mg / kg, plus placebo; and group 4 - - cimetidine plus chlorpheniramine.	[]
Histamine release occurred in most patients, the highest level 2 minutes after d - tubocurarine dosing.	[]
Group 1 had a moderate negative correlation between plasma histamine change and systemic vascular resistance ( r = 0. 58; P less than 0. 05) not present in group 4.	[]
Prior dosing with antagonists partially prevented the fall in systemic vascular resistance.	[]
These data demonstrate that the hemodynamic changes associated with d - tubocurarine dosing are only partially explained by histamine release.	[]
Thus prior dosing with H1 - and H2 - antagonists provides only partial protection.	[]
Cholecystokinin - octapeptide restored morphine - induced hippocampal long - term potentiation impairment in rats.	[]
Cholecystokinin - octapeptide ( CCK - 8), which is a typical brain - gut peptide, exerts a wide range of biological activities on the central nervous system.	[]
We have previously reported that CCK - 8 significantly alleviated morphine - induced amnesia and reversed spine density decreases in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in morphine - treated animals.	"amnesia	85	92	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""amnesia"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Here, we investigated the effects of CCK - 8 on long - term potentiation ( LTP) in the lateral perforant path ( LPP) - granule cell synapse of rat dentate gyrus ( DG) in acute saline or morphine - treated rats.	[]
Population spikes ( PS), which were evoked by stimulation of the LPP, were recorded in the DG region.	[]
Acute morphine ( 30mg / kg, s. c.) treatment significantly attenuated hippocampal LTP and CCK - 8 ( 1ug, i. c. v.) restored the amplitude of PS that was attenuated by morphine injection.	[]
Furthermore, microinjection of CCK - 8 ( 0. 1 and 1ug, i. c. v.) also significantly augmented hippocampal LTP in saline - treated ( 1ml / kg, s. c.) rats.	[]
Pre - treatment of the CCK2 receptor antagonist L - 365, 260 ( 10ug, i. c. v) reversed the effects of CCK - 8, but the CCK1 receptor antagonist L - 364, 718 ( 10ug, i. c. v) did not.	[]
The present results demonstrate that CCK - 8 attenuates the effect of morphine on hippocampal LTP through CCK2 receptors and suggest an ameliorative function of CCK - 8 on morphine - induced memory impairment.

Further, in experiment set up 2: where memory function was not affected i. e. 7 - 9 days after STZ treatment.	[]
The level of GFAP, CD11b, TNF - a, ROS and nitrite levels were increased.	[]
On the other hand, apoptotic marker, synaptic markers, mitochondrial activity and Ca ( 2 +) levels remained unaffected.	[]
Collective data indicates that neuroinflammatory process and oxidative stress occurs earlier to apoptosis and does not affect memory function.	"neuroinflammatory	31	48	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""neuroinflammatory"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

The aim of this study is to investigate and compare the protective effects of isotonic sodium chloride with sodium bicarbonate infusion and isotonic sodium chloride infusion with diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker, in preventing CIN.	[]
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study included patients who were administered 30 - 60 mL of iodinated contrast agent for percutaneous coronary angiography ( PCAG), all with creatinine values between 1. 1 and 3. 1 mg / dL.	[]
Patients were divided into three groups and each group had 20 patients.	[]
The first group of patients was administered isotonic sodium chloride; the second group was administered a solution that of 5% dextrose and sodium bicarbonate, while the third group was administered isotonic sodium chloride before and after the contrast injection.	[]
The third group received an additional injection of diltiazem the day before and first 2 days after the contrast injection.	[]
All of the patients ' plasma blood urea nitrogen ( BUN) and creatinine levels were measured on the second and seventh day after the administration of intravenous contrast material.	[]
RESULTS: The basal creatinine levels were similar for all three groups ( p > 0. 05).	[]
Among a total of 60 patients included in the study, 16 patients developed acute renal failure ( ARF) on the second day after contrast material was injected ( 26. 6%).

Two identical experiments separated by at least 7 days were performed.	[]
Reproducibility across and within volunteers ( inter - and intra - individual variation, respectively) was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC) and coefficient of variation ( CV).	[]
Secondary pinprick hyperalgesia was observed as a marked increase in the visual analogue scale ( VAS) response to von Frey gauges 60 and 100 g ( P < 0. 001) after glutamate injection.	"hyperalgesia	19	31	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hyperalgesia"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
For capsaicin, secondary pinprick hyperalgesia was detected with all von Frey gauges ( P < 0. 001).	"hyperalgesia	34	46	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hyperalgesia"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Glutamate evoked reproducible VAS response to all von Frey gauges ( ICC > 0. 60) and brush strokes ( ICC > 0. 83).	[]
Capsaicin injection was reproducible for secondary hyperalgesia ( ICC > 0. 70) and allodynia ( ICC > 0. 71).

Intra - individual variability was generally lower for the VAS response to von Frey and brush compared with areas of secondary hyperalgesia and allodynia.	"secondary hyperalgesia	117	139	Disease/Disorder"	"allodynia	144	153	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""secondary hyperalgesia"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""allodynia"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In conclusion, glutamate and capsaicin yield reproducible hyperalgesic and allodynic responses, and the present model is well suited for basic research, as well as for assessing the modulation of central phenomena.

Treatment of WT mice with topical ocular 0. 1% dexamethasone led to elevation of intraocular pressure ( IOP), functional and structural loss of retinal ganglion cells, and axonal degeneration, resembling glucocorticoid - induced glaucoma in human patients.

Furthermore, dexamethasone - induced ocular hypertension was associated with chronic ER stress of the trabecular meshwork ( TM).	"ocular hypertension	37	56	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ocular hypertension"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Similar to patients, withdrawal of dexamethasone treatment reduced elevated IOP and ER stress in this animal model.	[]
Dexamethasone induced the transcriptional factor CHOP, a marker for chronic ER stress, in the anterior segment tissues, and Chop deletion reduced ER stress in these tissues and prevented dexamethasone - induced ocular hypertension.	"ocular hypertension	211	230	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ocular hypertension"", ""start_span"": 211, ""end_span"": 230, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Furthermore, reduction of ER stress in the TM with sodium 4 - phenylbutyrate prevented dexamethasone - induced ocular hypertension in WT mice.

A comparison of severe hemodynamic disturbances between dexmedetomidine and propofol for sedation in neurocritical care patients.	[]
OBJECTIVE: Dexmedetomidine and propofol are commonly used sedatives in neurocritical care as they allow for frequent neurologic examinations.	[]
However, both agents are associated with significant hemodynamic side effects.	[]
The primary objective of this study is to compare the prevalence of severe hemodynamic effects in neurocritical care patients receiving dexmedetomidine and propofol.	[]
DESIGN: Multicenter, retrospective, propensity - matched cohort study.	[]
SETTING: Neurocritical care units at two academic medical centers with dedicated neurocritical care teams and board - certified neurointensivists.	[]
PATIENTS: Neurocritical care patients admitted between July 2009 and September 2012 were evaluated and then matched 1: 1 based on propensity scoring of baseline characteristics.	[]
INTERVENTIONS: Continuous sedation with dexmedetomidine or propofol.	[]
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 342 patients ( 105 dexmedetomidine and 237 propofol) were included in the analysis, with 190 matched ( 95 in each group) by propensity score.	[]
The primary outcome of this study was a composite of severe hypotension ( mean arterial pressure < 60 mm Hg) and bradycardia ( heart rate < 50 beats / min) during sedative infusion.

RESULTS: In the amphetamine - induced locomotion test, there were significant increases in all movements compared with the amphetamine - free group.	[]
Both DHEA 50 mg / kg ( p < 0. 05), and 100 mg / kg ( p < 0. 01) significantly decreased all movements compared with the amphetamine - induced locomotion group.	[]
There was a significant difference between groups in the haloperidol - induced catalepsy test ( p < 0. 05).	"catalepsy	79	88	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""catalepsy"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
There was no significant difference between groups in terms of total climbing time in the apomorphine - induced climbing test ( p > 0. 05).	[]
CONCLUSION: We observed that DHEA reduced locomotor activity and increased catalepsy at both doses, while it had no effect on climbing behavior.	"catalepsy	75	84	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""catalepsy"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Field potential duration ( FPD) in human - induced pluripotent stem cell - derived cardiomyocytes ( hiPS - CMs), which can express QT interval in an electrocardiogram, is reported to be a useful tool to predict K ( +) channel and Ca ( 2 +) channel blocker effects on QT interval.	[]
However, there is no report showing that this technique can be used to predict multichannel blocker potential for QT prolongation.	"QT prolongation	114	129	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""QT prolongation"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The aim of this study is to show that FPD from MEA ( Multielectrode array) of hiPS - CMs can detect QT prolongation induced by multichannel blockers.	"QT prolongation	100	115	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""QT prolongation"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
hiPS - CMs were seeded onto MEA and FPD was measured for 2min every 10min for 30min after drug exposure for the vehicle and each drug concentration.	[]
IKr and IKs blockers concentration - dependently prolonged corrected FPD ( FPDc), whereas Ca ( 2 +) channel blockers concentration - dependently shortened FPDc.	[]
Also, the multichannel blockers Amiodarone, Paroxetine, Terfenadine and Citalopram prolonged FPDc in a concentration dependent manner.	[]
Finally, the IKr blockers, Terfenadine and Citalopram, which are reported to cause Torsade de Pointes ( TdP) in clinical practice, produced early afterdepolarization ( EAD).

Our objective in this study was to investigate whether the compounds induce developmental toxicity via the dermal route, which is more relevant to occupational exposure, hence better addressing human health risks.	"toxicity	90	98	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""toxicity"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
METHODS: S - 53482 was administered dermally to rats at 30, 100, and 300 mg / kg during organogenesis, and S - 23121 was administered at 200, 400, and 800 mg / kg ( the maximum applicable dose level).	[]
Fetuses were obtained by a Cesarean section and examined for external, visceral, and skeletal alterations.	[]
RESULTS: Dermal exposure of rats to S - 53482 at 300 mg / kg produced patterns of developmental toxicity similar to those resulting from oral exposure.	"toxicity	96	104	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""toxicity"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Toxicity included embryolethality, teratogenicity, and growth retardation.

Dermal administration of S - 23121 at 800 mg / kg resulted in an increased incidence of embryonic death and ventricular septal defect, but retarded fetal growth was not observed as it was following oral exposure to S - 23121.	"embryonic death	88	103	Disease/Disorder"	"ventricular septal defect	108	133	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""embryonic death"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""ventricular septal defect"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results, S - 53482 and S - 23121 were teratogenic when administered dermally to pregnant rats as were the compounds administered orally.	"teratogenic	64	75	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""teratogenic"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

BACKGROUND: Cisplatin is a widely used antineoplastic.	[]
One of the major complications of cisplatin use is dose - limiting nephrotoxicity.	"nephrotoxicity	67	81	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""nephrotoxicity"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
There are many strategies to prevent this toxicity, including the use of mannitol as a nephroprotectant in combination with hydration.	"toxicity	42	50	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""toxicity"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the rates of cisplatin - induced nephrotoxicity in cancer patients receiving single - agent cisplatin with and without mannitol.	"nephrotoxicity	65	79	Disease/Disorder"	"cancer	83	89	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""nephrotoxicity"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""cancer"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
METHODS: This single - center retrospective analysis was a quasi experiment created by the national mannitol shortage.	[]
Data were collected on adult cancer patients receiving single - agent cisplatin as an outpatient from January 2011 to September 2012.	"cancer	29	35	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cancer"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The primary outcome was acute kidney injury ( AKI).

RESULTS: We evaluated 143 patients who received single - agent cisplatin; 97. 2% of patients had head and neck cancer as their primary malignancy.

Patients who did not receive mannitol were more likely to develop nephrotoxicity: odds ratio [ OR] = 2. 646 ( 95% CI = 1. 008, 6. 944; P = 0. 048).	"nephrotoxicity	66	80	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""nephrotoxicity"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Patients who received the 100 mg / m ( 2) dosing and patients who had a history of hypertension also had a higher likelihood of developing nephrotoxicity: OR = 11. 494 ( 95% CI = 4. 149, 32. 258; P < 0. 0001) and OR = 3. 219 ( 95% CI = 1. 228, 8. 439; P = 0. 017), respectively.	"hypertension	83	95	Disease/Disorder"	"nephrotoxicity	139	153	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hypertension"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""nephrotoxicity"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
CONCLUSIONS: When limited quantities of mannitol are available, it should preferentially be given to patients at particularly high risk of nephrotoxicity.	"nephrotoxicity	139	153	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""nephrotoxicity"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Our analysis suggests that those patients receiving the dosing schedule of 100 mg / m ( 2) cisplatin every 3 weeks and those with hypertension are at the greatest risk of nephrotoxicity and would benefit from the addition of mannitol.

However, current therapeutic interventions for epilepsy can also cause untoward cognitive effects.	"epilepsy	47	55	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""epilepsy"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Thus, there is an urgent need for new kinds of agents targeting both seizures and cognition deficits.	"seizures	69	77	Disease/Disorder"	"cognition deficits	82	100	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""seizures"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""cognition deficits"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Oxidative stress is considered to play an important role in epileptogenesis and cognitive deficits, and antioxidants have a putative antiepileptic potential.	"cognitive deficits	80	98	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cognitive deficits"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Metformin, the most commonly prescribed antidiabetic oral drug, has antioxidant properties.	[]
This study was designed to evaluate the ameliorative effects of metformin on seizures, cognitive impairment and brain oxidative stress markers observed in pentylenetetrazole - induced kindling animals.	"seizures	77	85	Disease/Disorder"	"cognitive impairment	87	107	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""seizures"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""cognitive impairment"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Male C57BL / 6 mice were administered with subconvulsive dose of pentylenetetrazole ( 37 mg / kg, i. p.) every other day for 14 injections.	[]
Metformin was injected intraperitoneally in dose of 200mg / kg along with alternate - day PTZ.	[]
We found that metformin suppressed the progression of kindling, ameliorated the cognitive impairment and decreased brain oxidative stress.	"cognitive impairment	80	100	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cognitive impairment"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Thus the present study concluded that metformin may be a potential agent for the treatment of epilepsy as well as a protective medicine against cognitive impairment induced by seizures.

AIMS: Doxorubicin ( DOX) is an effective anti - cancer therapeutic, but is associated with both acute and late - stage cardiotoxicity.	"cancer	48	54	Disease/Disorder"	"cardiotoxicity	119	133	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cancer"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""cardiotoxicity"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Children are particularly sensitive to DOX - induced heart failure.	"heart failure	53	66	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""heart failure"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Here, the impact of p53 inhibition on acute vs. late - stage DOX cardiotoxicity was examined in a juvenile model.	"cardiotoxicity	65	79	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cardiotoxicity"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
METHODS AND RESULTS: Two - week - old MHC - CB7 mice ( which express dominant - interfering p53 in cardiomyocytes) and their non - transgenic ( NON - TXG) littermates received weekly DOX injections for 5 weeks ( 25 mg / kg cumulative dose).	[]
One week after the last DOX treatment ( acute stage), MHC - CB7 mice exhibited improved cardiac function and lower levels of cardiomyocyte apoptosis when compared with the NON - TXG mice.	[]
Surprisingly, by 13 weeks following the last DOX treatment ( late stage), MHC - CB7 exhibited a progressive decrease in cardiac function and higher rates of cardiomyocyte apoptosis when compared with NON - TXG mice.	[]
p53 inhibition blocked transient DOX - induced STAT3 activation in MHC - CB7 mice, which was associated with enhanced induction of the DNA repair proteins Ku70 and Ku80.	[]
Mice with cardiomyocyte - restricted deletion of STAT3 exhibited worse cardiac function, higher levels of cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and a greater induction of Ku70 and Ku80 in response to DOX treatment during the acute stage when compared with control animals.	[]
CONCLUSION: These data support a model wherein a p53 - dependent cardioprotective pathway, mediated via STAT3 activation, mitigates DOX - induced myocardial stress during drug delivery.	[]
Furthermore, these data suggest an explanation as to how p53 inhibition can result in cardioprotection during drug treatment and, paradoxically, enhanced cardiotoxicity long after the cessation of drug treatment.

Aconitine is a major bioactive diterpenoid alkaloid with high content derived from herbal aconitum plants.	[]
Emerging evidence indicates that voltage - dependent Na ( +) channels have pivotal roles in the cardiotoxicity of aconitine.	"cardiotoxicity	96	110	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cardiotoxicity"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
However, no reports are available on the role of Ca ( 2 +) in aconitine poisoning.	"poisoning	72	81	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""poisoning"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

To investigate effects of aconitine on myocardial injury, we performed cytotoxicity assay in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes ( NRVMs), as well as measured lactate dehydrogenase level in the culture medium of NRVMs and activities of serum cardiac enzymes in rats.	"myocardial injury	39	56	Disease/Disorder"	"cytotoxicity	71	83	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""myocardial injury"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""cytotoxicity"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The results showed that aconitine resulted in myocardial injury and reduced NRVMs viability dose - dependently.	"myocardial injury	46	63	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""myocardial injury"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
To confirm the pro - apoptotic effects, we performed flow cytometric detection, cardiac histology, transmission electron microscopy and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase - mediated dUTP - biotin nick end labeling assay.	[]
The results showed that aconitine stimulated apoptosis time - dependently.	[]
The expression analysis of Ca ( 2 +) handling proteins demonstrated that aconitine promoted Ca ( 2 +) overload through the expression regulation of Ca ( 2 +) handling proteins.	[]
The expression analysis of apoptosis - related proteins revealed that pro - apoptotic protein expression was upregulated, and anti - apoptotic protein BCL - 2 expression was downregulated.	[]
Furthermore, increased phosphorylation of MAPK family members, especially the P - P38 / P38 ratio was found in cardiac tissues.	[]
Hence, our results suggest that aconitine significantly aggravates Ca ( 2 +) overload and causes arrhythmia and finally promotes apoptotic development via phosphorylation of P38 mitogen - activated protein kinase.

Similar changes were also seen in the serum levels of TNF - a and IL - 6.	[]
However, the lower doses of 25 and 50mg / kg were more effective than 100mg / kg.	[]
Phosphorylated AMPKa ( p - AMPK) in the myocardium was significantly elevated by 25mg / kg of metformin, slightly by 50mg / kg, but not by 100mg / kg.	[]

METHODS: Adult male Wistar rats were intracerebroventricularly ( icv) infused with STZ ( 750 ug) on d 1 and d 3, and a passive avoidance task was assessed 2 weeks after the first injection of STZ.	[]
Castration surgery was performed in another group of rats, and the passive avoidance task was assessed 4 weeks after the operation.	[]
Testosterone ( 1 mg. kg ( - 1). d ( - 1), sc), the androgen receptor antagonist flutamide ( 10 mg. kg ( - 1). d ( - 1), ip), the estrogen receptor antagonist tamoxifen ( 1 mg. kg ( - 1). d ( - 1), ip) or the aromatase inhibitor letrozole ( 4 mg. kg ( - 1). d ( - 1), ip) were administered for 6 d after the first injection of STZ.

However, there is no research on GFC effects in the central nervous system of rodents.	[]
The present study aimed to evaluate the GFC effects at doses of 25, 50 or 75 mg / kg on seizure parameters to determine their anticonvulsant activity and its effects on amino acid ( r - aminobutyric acid ( GABA), glutamine, aspartate and glutathione) levels as well as on acetylcholinesterase ( AChE) activity in mice hippocampus after seizures.

GFC produced an increased latency to first seizure, at doses 25mg / kg ( 20. 12 + 2. 20 min), 50mg / kg ( 20. 95 + 2. 21 min) or 75 mg / kg ( 23. 43 + 1. 99 min) when compared with seized mice.	"seizure	43	50	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""seizure"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In addition, GABA content of mice hippocampus treated with GFC75 plus P400 showed an increase of 46. 90% when compared with seized mice.	[]
In aspartate, glutamine and glutamate levels detected a decrease of 5. 21%, 13. 55% and 21. 80%, respectively in mice hippocampus treated with GFC75 plus P400 when compared with seized mice.	[]
Hippocampus mice treated with GFC75 plus P400 showed an increase in AChE activity ( 63. 30%) when compared with seized mice.	[]
The results indicate that GFC can exert anticonvulsant activity and reduce the frequency of installation of pilocarpine - induced status epilepticus, as demonstrated by increase in latency to first seizure and decrease in mortality rate of animals.	"status epilepticus	130	148	Disease/Disorder"	"seizure	198	205	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""status epilepticus"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""seizure"", ""start_span"": 198, ""end_span"": 205, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In conclusion, our data suggest that GFC may influence in epileptogenesis and promote anticonvulsant actions in pilocarpine model by modulating the GABA and glutamate contents and of AChE activity in seized mice hippocampus.	[]
This compound may be useful to produce neuronal protection and it can be considered as an anticonvulsant agent.	[]

The creatine kinase peaked at 62, 246 IU / L and the patient was treated with intravenous normal saline.	[]
The patient ' s renal function remained unaffected.	[]
Fourteen days after hospitalization, creatine kinase level had returned to 230 IU / L and the patient was discharged.	[]
Telaprevir was considered the probable causative agent of an interaction with simvastatin according to the Drug Interaction Probability Scale.	[]
The interaction is due to inhibition of CYP3A4 - mediated simvastatin clearance.	[]
Simvastatin plasma concentration increased 30 times in this patient and statin induced muscle toxicity is related to the concentration of the statin in blood.

Moreover, treatment with the kinin B2 receptor antagonist effectively reduced the levels of serum creatinine and blood urea after cisplatin administration.	[]
Thus, our data suggest that the kinin B2 receptor is involved in cisplatin - induced acute kidney injury by mediating the necrotic process and the expression of inflammatory cytokines, thus resulting in declined renal function.

The current study identified the optimal dose of rocuronium to prevent succinylcholine - induced fasciculation and myalgia and evaluated the influence of rocuronium on the speed of onset produced by succinylcholine.	"fasciculation	97	110	Disease/Disorder"	"myalgia	115	122	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""fasciculation"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""myalgia"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
METHODS: This randomized, double - blinded study was conducted in 100 patients randomly allocated into five groups of 20 patients each.	[]
Patients were randomized to receive 0. 02, 0. 03, 0. 04, 0. 05 and 0. 06 mg / kg rocuronium as a precurarizing dose.	[]
Neuromuscular monitoring after each precurarizing dose was recorded from the adductor pollicis muscle using acceleromyography with train - of - four stimulation of the ulnar nerve.	[]
All patients received succinylcholine 1. 5 mg / kg at 2 minutes after the precurarization, and were assessed the incidence and severity of fasciculations, while myalgia was assessed at 24 hours after surgery.	"fasciculations	139	153	Disease/Disorder"	"myalgia	161	168	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""fasciculations"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""myalgia"", ""start_span"": 161, ""end_span"": 168, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
RESULTS: The incidence and severity of visible muscle fasciculation was significantly less with increasing the amount of precurarizing dose of rocuronium ( P < 0. 001).	"muscle fasciculation	47	67	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""muscle fasciculation"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Those of myalgia tend to decrease according to increasing the amount of precurarizing dose of rocuronium, but there was no significance ( P = 0. 072).	"myalgia	9	16	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""myalgia"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The onset time of succinylcholine was significantly longer with increasing the amount of precurarizing dose of rocuronium ( P < 0. 001).	[]
CONCLUSIONS: Precurarization with 0. 04 mg / kg rocuronium was the optimal dose considering the reduction in the incidence and severity of fasciculation and myalgia with acceptable onset time, and the safe and effective precurarization.

The decreased capacity to concentrate urine is likely due to lithium acutely disrupting the cAMP pathway and chronically reducing urea transporter ( UT - A1) and water channel ( AQP2) expression in the inner medulla.	[]
Targeting an alternative signaling pathway, such as PKC - mediated signaling, may be an effective method of treating lithium - induced polyuria.	"polyuria	135	143	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""polyuria"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
PKC - alpha null mice ( PKCa KO) and strain - matched wild type ( WT) controls were treated with lithium for 0, 3 or 5 days.	[]
WT mice had increased urine output and lowered urine osmolality after 3 and 5 days of treatment whereas PKCa KO mice had no change in urine output or concentration.	[]
Western blot analysis revealed that AQP2 expression in medullary tissues was lowered after 3 and 5 days in WT mice; however, AQP2 was unchanged in PKCa KO.	[]
Similar results were observed with UT - A1 expression.	[]
Animals were also treated with lithium for 6 weeks.	[]
Lithium - treated WT mice had 19 - fold increased urine output whereas treated PKCa KO animals had a 4 - fold increase in output.	[]
AQP2 and UT - A1 expression was lowered in 6 week lithium - treated WT animals whereas in treated PKCa KO mice, AQP2 was only reduced by 2 - fold and UT - A1 expression was unaffected.	[]
Urinary sodium, potassium and calcium were elevated in lithium - fed WT but not in lithium - fed PKCa KO mice.	[]
Our data show that ablation of PKCa preserves AQP2 and UT - A1 protein expression and localization in lithium - induced NDI, and prevents the development of the severe polyuria associated with lithium therapy.

"Inhibition studies, kinetic analysis and molecular dynamics were undertaken to understand how this mutation disrupts the catalytic triad and determines a "" silent "" phenotype."	[]
Low activity of patient plasma butyrylcholinesterase with butyrylthiocholine ( BTC) and benzoylcholine, and values of dibucaine and fluoride numbers fit with heterozygous atypical silent genotype.	[]
Electrophoretic analysis of plasma BChE of the proband and his mother showed that patient has a reduced amount of tetrameric enzyme in plasma and that minor fast - moving BChE components: monomer, dimer, and monomer - albumin conjugate are missing.	[]
Kinetic analysis showed that the p. Val204Asp / p. Asp70Gly - p. Ala539Thr BChE displays a pure Michaelian behavior with BTC as the substrate.	[]
Both catalytic parameters Km = 265 uM for BTC, two times higher than that of the atypical enzyme, and a low Vmax are consistent with the absence of activity against suxamethonium.	[]
Molecular dynamic ( MD) simulations showed that the overall effect of the mutation p. Val204Asp is disruption of hydrogen bonding between Gln223 and Glu441, leading Ser198 and His438 to move away from each other with subsequent disruption of the catalytic triad functionality regardless of the type of substrate.

Her sensation of light touch and pain was diminished over the lateral side of the right forearm and wrist area.	"pain	33	37	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""pain"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
RESULTS: The sensory action potential amplitude of the right lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve ( LACN) ( 6. 2 uV) was lower than that of the left ( 13. 1 uV).	[]
The difference of amplitude between both sides was significant because there was more than a 50% reduction.	[]
She was diagnosed with right LACNP ( mainly axonal involvement) on the basis of the clinical manifestation and the electrodiagnostic findings.	[]
Her symptoms improved through physical therapy but persisted to some degree.	[]
CONCLUSION: This report describes the case of a woman with LACNP that developed after a steroid injection for the treatment of lateral epicondylitis.

An electrodiagnostic study, including a nerve conduction study of the LACN, was helpful to diagnose right LACNP and to find the passage of the LACN on the lateral epicondyle.	[]
Curcumin prevents maleate - induced nephrotoxicity: relation to hemodynamic alterations, oxidative stress, mitochondrial oxygen consumption and activity of respiratory complex I.	"nephrotoxicity	36	50	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""nephrotoxicity"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The potential protective effect of the dietary antioxidant curcumin ( 120 mg / Kg / day for 6 days) against the renal injury induced by maleate was evaluated.	"renal injury	112	124	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""renal injury"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Tubular proteinuria and oxidative stress were induced by a single injection of maleate ( 400 mg / kg) in rats.	"proteinuria	8	19	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""proteinuria"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Maleate - induced renal injury included increase in renal vascular resistance and in the urinary excretion of total protein, glucose, sodium, neutrophil gelatinase - associated lipocalin ( NGAL) and N - acetyl b - D - glucosaminidase ( NAG), upregulation of kidney injury molecule ( KIM) - 1, decrease in renal blood flow and claudin - 2 expression besides of necrosis and apoptosis of tubular cells on 24 h.

Oxidative stress was determined by measuring the oxidation of lipids and proteins and diminution in renal Nrf2 levels.	[]
Studies were also conducted in renal epithelial LLC - PK1 cells and in mitochondria isolated from kidneys of all the experimental groups.	[]
Maleate induced cell damage and reactive oxygen species ( ROS) production in LLC - PK1 cells in culture.	[]
In addition, maleate treatment reduced oxygen consumption in ADP - stimulated mitochondria and diminished respiratory control index when using malate / glutamate as substrate.	[]
The activities of both complex I and aconitase were also diminished.	[]
All the above - described alterations were prevented by curcumin.	[]
It is concluded that curcumin is able to attenuate in vivo maleate - induced nephropathy and in vitro cell damage.	"nephropathy	77	88	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""nephropathy"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The in vivo protection was associated to the prevention of oxidative stress and preservation of mitochondrial oxygen consumption and activity of respiratory complex I, and the in vitro protection was associated to the prevention of ROS production.	[]
Anticonvulsant actions of MK - 801 on the lithium - pilocarpine model of status epilepticus in rats.	"status epilepticus	73	91	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""status epilepticus"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
MK - 801, a noncompetitive N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA) receptor antagonist, was tested for anticonvulsant effects in rats using two seizure models, coadministration of lithium and pilocarpine and administration of a high dose of pilocarpine alone.	"seizure	139	146	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""seizure"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Three major results are reported.	[]
First, pretreatment with MK - 801 produced an effective and dose - dependent anticonvulsant action with the lithium - pilocarpine model but not with rats treated with pilocarpine alone, suggesting that different biochemical mechanisms control seizures in these two models.	"seizures	243	251	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""seizures"", ""start_span"": 243, ""end_span"": 251, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Second, the anticonvulsant effect of MK - 801 in the lithium - pilocarpine model only occurred after initial periods of seizure activity.	"seizure	120	127	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""seizure"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
This observation is suggested to be an in vivo demonstration of the conclusion derived from in vitro experiments that MK - 801 binding requires agonist - induced opening of the channel sites of the NMDA receptor.	[]
Third, although it is relatively easy to block seizures induced by lithium and pilocarpine by administration of anticonvulsants prior to pilocarpine, it is more difficult to terminate ongoing status epilepticus and block the lethality of the seizures.	"seizures	47	55	Disease/Disorder"	"status epilepticus	192	210	Disease/Disorder"	"seizures	47	55	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""seizures"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""status epilepticus"", ""start_span"": 192, ""end_span"": 210, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""seizures"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Administration of MK - 801 30 or 60 min after pilocarpine, i. e., during status epilepticus, gradually reduced electrical and behavioral seizure activity and greatly enhanced the survival rate.	"status epilepticus	73	91	Disease/Disorder"	"seizure	137	144	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""status epilepticus"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""seizure"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
These results suggest that activation of NMDA receptors plays an important role in status epilepticus and brain damage in the lithium - pilocarpine model.	"status epilepticus	83	101	Disease/Disorder"	"brain damage	106	118	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""status epilepticus"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""brain damage"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
This was further supported by results showing that nonconvulsive doses of NMDA and pilocarpine were synergistic, resulting in status epilepticus and subsequent mortality.

METHODS: Male pesticide applicators in Iowa and North Carolina reported lifetime diazinon use at enrolment ( 1993 - 1997) and follow - up ( 1998 - 2005); cancer incidence was assessed through 2010 ( North Carolina) / 2011 ( Iowa).	"cancer	154	160	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cancer"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 160, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Among applicators with usage information sufficient to evaluate exposure - response patterns, we used Poisson regression to estimate adjusted rate ratios ( RRs) and 95% CI for cancer sites with > 10 exposed cases for both lifetime ( LT) exposure days and intensity - weighted ( IW) lifetime exposure days ( accounting for factors impacting exposure).	"cancer	176	182	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cancer"", ""start_span"": 176, ""end_span"": 182, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
RESULTS: We observed elevated lung cancer risks ( N = 283) among applicators with the greatest number of LT ( RR = 1. 60; 95% CI 1. 11 to 2. 31; Ptrend = 0. 02) and IW days of diazinon use ( RR = 1. 41; 95% CI 0. 98 to 2. 04; Ptrend = 0. 08).

Recent research suggested that IUGR is a risk factor for glomerulosclerosis.

However, whether PCE could induce glomerulosclerosis and its underlying mechanisms remain unknown.	"glomerulosclerosis	34	52	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""glomerulosclerosis"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
This study aimed to demonstrate the induction to glomerulosclerosis in adult offspring by PCE and its intrauterine programming mechanisms.	"glomerulosclerosis	49	67	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""glomerulosclerosis"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

The results revealed that the adult offspring kidneys in the PCE group exhibited glomerulosclerosis as well as interstitial fibrosis, accompanied by elevated levels of serum creatinine and urine protein.

Renal angiotensin II receptor type 2 ( AT2R) gene expression in adult offspring was reduced by PCE, whereas the renal angiotensin II receptor type 1a ( AT1aR) / AT2R expression ratio was increased.	[]
The fetal kidneys in the PCE group displayed an enlarged Bowman ' s space and a shrunken glomerular tuft, accompanied by a reduced cortex width and an increase in the nephrogenic zone / cortical zone ratio.	[]
Observation by electronic microscope revealed structural damage of podocytes; the reduced expression level of podocyte marker genes, nephrin and podocin, was also detected by q - PCR.	[]
Moreover, AT2R gene and protein expressions in fetal kidneys were inhibited by PCE, associated with the repression of the gene expression of glial - cell - line - derived neurotrophic factor ( GDNF) / tyrosine kinase receptor ( c - Ret) signaling pathway.	[]
These results demonstrated that PCE could induce dysplasia of fetal kidneys as well as glomerulosclerosis of adult offspring, and the low functional programming of renal AT2R might mediate the developmental origin of adult glomerulosclerosis.

Ionizing radiation is capable of inducing the requisite CML - associated t ( 9: 22) translocation ( Philadelphia chromosome) in appropriate cells in vitro but, thus far, chemicals have not shown this capacity.

We have proposed that 1, 3 - butadiene metabolites be so tested as a reality check on the epidemiological reports.	[]
In order to conduct reliable testing in this regard, it is essential that a positive control for induction be available.	[]
We have used ionizing radiation to develop such a control.	[]
Results described here demonstrate that this agent does in fact induce pathogenic t ( 9: 22) translocations in a human myeloid cell line in vitro, but does so at low frequencies.	[]
Conditions that will be required for studies of 1, 3 - butadiene are discussed.	[]

Mechanisms Underlying Latent Disease Risk Associated with Early - Life Arsenic Exposure: Current Research Trends and Scientific Gaps.	[]
BACKGROUND: Millions of individuals worldwide, particularly those living in rural and developing areas, are exposed to harmful levels of inorganic arsenic ( iAs) in their drinking water.	[]
Inorganic As exposure during key developmental periods is associated with a variety of adverse health effects including those that are evident in adulthood.	[]
There is considerable interest in identifying the molecular mechanisms that relate early - life iAs exposure to the development of these latent diseases, particularly in relationship to cancer.	"cancer	186	192	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cancer"", ""start_span"": 186, ""end_span"": 192, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
OBJECTIVES: This work summarizes research on the molecular mechanisms that underlie the increased risk of cancer development in adulthood that is associated with early - life iAs exposure.	"cancer	106	112	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cancer"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
DISCUSSION: Epigenetic reprogramming that imparts functional changes in gene expression, the development of cancer stem cells, and immunomodulation are plausible underlying mechanisms by which early - life iAs exposure elicits latent carcinogenic effects.	"cancer	108	114	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cancer"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence is mounting that relates early - life iAs exposure and cancer development later in life.	"cancer	77	83	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cancer"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Differential effects of 1, 4 - dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers: therapeutic implications.	[]
Increasing recognition of the importance of calcium in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease has stimulated research into the use of calcium channel blocking agents for treatment of a variety of cardiovascular diseases.

The favorable efficacy and tolerability profiles of these agents make them attractive therapeutic modalities.	[]
Clinical applications of calcium channel blockers parallel their tissue selectivity.	[]
In contrast to verapamil and diltiazem, which are roughly equipotent in their actions on the heart and vascular smooth muscle, the dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are a group of potent peripheral vasodilator agents that exert minimal electrophysiologic effects on cardiac nodal or conduction tissue.	[]
As the first dihydropyridine available for use in the United States, nifedipine controls angina and hypertension with minimal depression of cardiac function.

Additional members of this group of calcium channel blockers have been studied for a variety of indications for which they may offer advantages over current therapy.	[]
Once or twice daily dosage possible with nitrendipine and nisoldipine offers a convenient administration schedule, which encourages patient compliance in long - term therapy of hypertension.

The series of injections were repeated another three times at 10 day intervals.	[]
The animals were sacrificed on days 24, 52, and 80.	[]

Under barbiturate anesthesia, virtually all of the myocardial contractile indices were depressed significantly in barium - exposed rats relative to the corresponding control - fed rats.	[]
The lack of a similar response to ketamine and xylazine anesthesia revealed that the cardiovascular actions of sodium pentobarbital in barium - treated rats were linked specifically to this anesthetic, and were not representative of a generalized anesthetic response.	[]
Other myocardial pathophysiologic and metabolic changes induced by barium were manifest, irrespective of the anesthetic employed.	[]
The contractile element shortening velocity of the cardiac muscle fibers was significantly slower in both groups of barium - treated rats relative to the control groups, irrespective of the anesthetic regimen.	[]
Similarly, significant disturbances in myocardial energy metabolism were detected in the barium - exposed rats which were consistent with the reduced contractile element shortening velocity.	[]
In addition, the excitability of the cardiac conduction system was depressed preferentially in the atrioventricular nodal region of hearts from barium - exposed rats.	[]
Overall, the altered cardiac contractility and excitability characteristics, the myocardial metabolic disturbances, and the hypersensitivity of the cardiovascular system to sodium pentobarbital suggest the existence of a heretofore undescribed cardiomyopathic disorder induced by chronic barium exposure.

Subjects received propranolol either by mouth for 48 hours before PPA or as a rapid intravenous infusion after PPA.	[]
PPA, 75 mg alone, increased blood pressure ( 31 + / - 14 mm Hg systolic, 20 + / - 5 mm Hg diastolic), and propranolol pretreatment antagonized this increase ( 12 + / - 10 mm Hg systolic, 10 + / - 7 mm Hg diastolic).	[]
Intravenous propranolol after PPA also decreased blood pressure.	[]
Left ventricular function ( assessed by echocardiography) showed that PPA increased the stroke volume 30% ( from 62. 5 + / - 20. 9 to 80. 8 + / - 22. 4 ml), the ejection fraction 9% ( from 64% + / - 10% to 70% + / - 7%), and cardiac output 14% ( from 3. 6 + / - 0. 6 to 4. 1 + / - 1. 0 L / min).

Intravenous propranolol reversed these effects.	[]
Systemic vascular resistance was increased by PPA 28% ( from 1710 + / - 200 to 2190 + / - 700 dyne X sec / cm5) and was further increased by propranolol 22% ( to 2660 + / - 1200 dyne X sec / cm5).	[]
We conclude that PPA increases blood pressure by increasing systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output, and that propranolol antagonizes this increase by reversing the effect of PPA on cardiac output.	[]
That propranolol antagonizes the pressor effect of PPA is in contrast to the interaction in which propranolol enhances the pressor effect of norepinephrine.	[]
This is probably because PPA has less beta 2 activity than does norepinephrine.	[]

A controversy has existed for several years concerning the physiological relevance of the nicotinic receptor measured by alpha - bungarotoxin binding.	[]
Using mice derived from a classical F2 and backcross genetic design, a relationship between nicotine - induced seizures and alpha - bungarotoxin nicotinic receptor concentration was found.	"seizures	111	119	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""seizures"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Mice sensitive to the convulsant effects of nicotine had greater alpha - bungarotoxin binding in the hippocampus than seizure insensitive mice.	"seizure	118	125	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""seizure"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Recently, p - aminophenol ( PAP), a known potent nephrotoxicant, was identified as a metabolite of APAP in F344 rats.	[]
The purpose of this study was to determine if PAP formation is a requisite step in APAP - induced nephrotoxicity.	"nephrotoxicity	98	112	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""nephrotoxicity"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

BNPP ( 1 to 8 mM) reduced APAP deacetylation and covalent binding in F344 renal cortical homogenates in a concentration - dependent manner.	[]
Pretreatment of animals with BNPP prior to APAP or PAP administration resulted in marked reduction of APAP ( 900 mg / kg) nephrotoxicity but not PAP nephrotoxicity.

This result was not due to altered disposition of either APAP or acetylated metabolites in plasma or renal cortical and hepatic tissue.	[]
Rather, BNPP pretreatment reduced the fraction of APAP excreted as PAP by 64 and 75% after APAP doses of 750 and 900 mg / kg.	[]
BNPP did not alter the excretion of APAP or any of its non - deacetylated metabolites nor did BNPP alter excretion of PAP or its metabolites after PAP doses of 150 and 300 mg / kg.	[]
Therefore, the BNPP - induced reduction in APAP - induced nephrotoxicity appears to be due to inhibition of APAP deacetylation.	"nephrotoxicity	58	72	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""nephrotoxicity"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

After atropine the CD25 was unchanged after placebo ( 2. 3 + / - 0. 3 micrograms) and atenolol ( 7. 7 + / - 1. 3 micrograms); it was reduced after propranolol ( 24. 8 + / - 5. 0 micrograms), but remained different from atenolol.	[]
This change with propranolol sensitivity was calculated as the apparent Ka, this was unchanged by atropine ( 11. 7 + / - 2. 1 and 10. 1 + / - 2. 5 ml / ng).	[]
These data are consistent with the hypothesis that exercise - induced tachycardia results largely from beta 1 - receptor activation that is blocked by both cardioselective and nonselective drugs, whereas isoproterenol activates both beta 1 - and beta 2 - receptors so that after cardioselective blockade there remains a beta 2 - component that can be blocked with a nonselective drug.

This paper reports the results of a study of 50 menopausal women receiving hormonal replacement therapy.	[]
The majority ( 29) had surgical menopause; their mean age was 45. 7 years.	[]
It was hypothesized that progestins could equilibrate the effects of the estrogenic stimulation on the mammary and endometrial target tissues of women on hormonal replacement therapy.	[]
The treatment schedule consisted of conjugated estrogens ( Premarin) 1. 25 mg / day for 21 days and Medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg / day for 10 days in each month.	[]
The mean treatment period was 18 months.	[]
During the follow - up period, attention was paid to breast modifications as evidenced by symptomatology, physical examination, and plate thermography.	[]
Mastodynia was reported by 21 patients, and physical examination revealed a light increase in breast firmness in 12 women and a moderate increase in breast nodularity in 2 women.

Normalization was obtained by halving the estrogen dose.	[]
These results suggest that hormonal replacement therapy can be safely prescribed if the following criteria are satisfied: 1) preliminary evaluation of patients from a clinical, metabolic, cytologic, and mammographic perspective; 2) cyclic treatment schedule, with a progestative phase of 10 days; and 3) periodic complete follow - up, with accurate thermographic evaluation of the breast target tissues.

A significant increase in the myocardial t1 / 2 of the I - 131 HA was observed only at a higher cumulative dose, 10 mg / kg.	[]
No significant alteration in total extractable myocardial lipids was observed between control dogs and those treated with doxorubicin.	[]
Our findings suggest that the changes leading to an alteration of myocardial dynamic imaging with I - 131 HA are not the initiating factor in doxorubicin cardiotoxicity.

In vitro perfusion of bepridil in the life - support medium for isolated sino - atrial tissue from rabbit heart, caused a reduction in action potential ( AP) spike frequency ( recorded by KCl microelectrodes) starting at doses of 5 X 10 ( - 6) M.	[]
This effect was dose - dependent up to concentrations of 5 X 10 ( - 5) M, whereupon blockade of sinus activity set in.	[]
Bepridil at a dose of 5 X 10 ( - 6) M, induced a concomitant reduction in AP amplitude ( falling from 71 + / - 8 mV to 47 + / - 6 mV), maximum systolic depolarization velocity ( phase 0) which fell from 1. 85 + / - 0. 35 V / s to 0. 84 + / - 0. 28 V / s, together with maximum diastolic depolarization velocity ( phase 4) which fell from 38 + / - 3 mV / s to 24 + / - 5 mV / s.	[]
In vivo injection of bepridil at a dose of 5 mg / kg ( i. v.) into 6 anaesthetized dogs which had undergone ablation of all the extrinsic cardiac afferent nerve supply, together with a bilateral medullo - adrenalectomy, caused a marked reduction in heart rate which fell from 98. 7 + / - 4. 2 beats / min to 76 + / - 5. 3 beats / min sustained for more than 45 min.	[]
It is concluded that bepridil reduces heart rate by acting directly on the sinus node.	[]
This effect, which results in a flattening of the phase 0 and phase 4 slope, together with a longer AP duration, may be due to an increase in the time constants of slow inward ionic currents ( already demonstrated elsewhere), but also to an increased time constant for deactivation of the outward potassium current ( Ip).

The aim of this study was to determine if the prophylactic value of misoprostol was dose - dependent.	[]
Parameters of renal hemodynamics and tubular sodium and water handling were assessed by clearance techniques in 26 well compensated cirrhotic patients before and after an oral combination of 50 mg of indomethacin and various doses of misoprostol.

The 200 - micrograms dose was able to totally abolish the deleterious renal effects of indomethacin, whereas the 800 - micrograms dose resulted in significant worsening of renal hemodynamics and sodium retention.	[]
These changes were maximal in the hour immediately after medications and slowly returned toward base - line levels thereafter.	[]
These results suggest that the renal protective effects of misoprostol is dose - dependent.	[]
However, until this apparent ability of 200 micrograms of misoprostol to prevent the adverse effects of indomethacin on renal function is confirmed with chronic frequent dosing, it would be prudent to avoid nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory therapy in patients with cirrhosis.

A significant reduction in urinary guanosine 3 ', 5 ' - cyclic monophosphate ( cGMP) excretion and a significant increase in renal cortical renin and endothelin - 1 contents were also observed in GM - mediated nephropathy.

Superoxide dismutase ( SOD) or dimethylthiourea ( DMTU) significantly lessened the GM - induced decrement in CIn.	[]
The SOD - induced increase in glomerular filtration rate was associated with a marked improvement in RBF, an increase in urinary cGMP excretion, and a decrease in renal renin and endothelin - 1 content.	[]
SOD did not attenuate the tubular damage.	"tubular damage	26	40	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tubular damage"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

The purpose of the present study was to compare influence of central arginine vasopressin ( AVP) and of atrial natriuretic peptide ( ANP) on control of arterial blood pressure ( MAP) and heart rate ( HR) in normotensive ( WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive ( SHR) rats.

Three series of experiments were performed on 30 WKY and 30 SHR, chronically instrumented with guide tubes in the lateral ventricle ( LV) and arterial and venous catheters.	[]
MAP and HR were monitored before and after i. v. injections of either vehicle or 1, 10 and 50 ng of AVP and 25, 125 and 500 ng of ANP.	[]
Sensitivity of cardiac component of baroreflex ( CCB), expressed as a slope of the regression line was determined from relationships between systolic arterial pressure ( SAP) and HR period ( HRp) during phenylephrine ( Phe) - induced hypertension and sodium nitroprusside ( SN) - induced hypotension.

CCB was measured before and after administration of either vehicle, AVP, ANP, or both peptides together.	[]
Increases of MAP occurred after LV administration of 1, 10 and 50 ng of AVP in WKY and of 10 and 50 ng in SHR.	[]
ANP did not cause significant changes in MAP in both strains as compared to vehicle, but it abolished AVP - induced MAP increase in WKY and SHR.	[]
CCB was reduced in WKY and SHR after LV administration of AVP during SN - induced hypotension.	"hypotension	82	93	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hypotension"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In SHR but not in WKY administration of ANP, AVP and ANP + AVP decreased CCB during Phe - induced MAP elevation.	[]
The results indicate that centrally applied AVP and ANP exert differential effects on blood pressure and baroreflex control of heart rate in WKY and SHR and suggest interaction of these two peptides in blood pressure regulation at the level of central nervous system.	[]

With 2 - week chronic epinephrine infusion, 16 of 30 rats died within 4 days, and severe ischemic lesions and fibrosis of the left ventricles were observed.

In epinephrine - treated rats, left atrial and left ventricular papillary muscle contractile responses to isoproterenol were reduced, but responses to calcium were normal or enhanced compared to controls.	[]
Left ventricular alpha and beta adrenoceptor densities were also reduced compared to controls.	[]
Treatment with clentiazem prevented epinephrine - induced death ( P <. 05), and attenuated the ventricular ischemic lesions and fibrosis, in a dose - dependent manner.

Left atrial and left ventricular papillary muscle contractile responses to isoproterenol were reduced compared to controls in groups treated with clentiazem alone, but combined with epinephrine, clentiazem restored left atrial responses and enhanced left ventricular papillary responses to isoproterenol.	[]
On the other hand clentiazem did not prevent epinephrine - induced down - regulation of alpha and beta adrenoceptors.	[]
Interestingly, clentiazem, infused alone, resulted in decreased adrenergic receptor densities in the left ventricle.	[]
Clentiazem also did not prevent the enhanced responses to calcium seen in the epinephrine - treated animals, although the high dose of clentiazem partially attenuated the maximal response to calcium compared to epinephrine - treated animals.	[]
In conclusion, clentiazem attenuated epinephrine - induced cardiac injury, possibly through its effect on the adrenergic pathway.	"cardiac injury	59	73	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cardiac injury"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

The influence of L - dopa on the renal excretion of potassium was studied in 3 patients with hypokalemia and in 5 normokalemic patients by determination of renal plasma flow, glomerular filtration rate, plasma concentration of potassium and sodium as well as urinary excretion of potassium, sodium and aldosterone.

However, for monitoring during treatment, large numbers of animals are needed.	[]
Recently we developed a new method to measure ECG values in freely moving mice by telemetry.	[]
With this model we investigated the effect of chronic doxorubicin administration on the ECG of freely moving BALB / c mice and the efficacy of ICRF - 187 as a protective agent.	[]
The ST interval significantly widened from 15. 0 + / - 1. 5 to 56. 8 + / - 11. 8 ms in week 10 ( 7 weekly doses of 4 mg / kg doxorubicin given i. v. plus 3 weeks of observation).	[]
The ECG of the control animals did not change during the entire study.	[]

As this schedule exerted more toxicity than needed to investigate protective agents, the protection of ICRF - 187 was determined using a dose schedule with lower general toxicity ( 6 weekly doses of 4 mg / kg doxorubicin given i. v. plus 2 weeks of observation).	"toxicity	30	38	Disease/Disorder"	"toxicity	30	38	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""toxicity"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""toxicity"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
On this schedule, the animals ' hearts appeared normal after sacrifice and ICRF - 187 ( 50 mg / kg given i. p. 1 h before doxorubicin) provided almost full protection.	[]
These data were confirmed by histology.	[]
The results indicate that this new model is very sensitive and enables monitoring of the development of cardiotoxicity with time.	"cardiotoxicity	104	118	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cardiotoxicity"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Epinephrine dysrhythmogenicity is not enhanced by subtoxic bupivacaine in dogs.	[]
Since bupivacaine and epinephrine may both precipitate dysrhythmias, circulating bupivacaine during regional anesthesia could potentiate dysrhythmogenic effects of epinephrine.

After 45 min, 1 mg / kg bupivacaine was injected over 5 min, again followed by 4 micrograms. kg - 1. min - 1 epinephrine.	[]
In these dogs, the prodysrhythmic response to epinephrine was also mitigated by preceding bupivacaine.	[]
Bupivacaine antagonizes epinephrine dysrhythmogenicity in conscious dogs susceptible to VT and in anesthetized dogs with spontaneous postinfarct dysrhythmias.

Ten weeks of diethylstilbestrol ( DES) treatment caused female F344 rat pituitaries to grow to an average of 109. 2 + / - 6. 3 mg ( mean + / - SE) versus 11. 3 + / - 1. 4 mg for untreated rats, and to become highly hemorrhagic.

Injection of CYP ( n = 10, 75 mg / kg, i. p.) 2 hours prior to perfusion ( acute treatment) of the animals increased Fos - immunoreactivity ( IR) in neurons in the dorsal commissure, dorsal horn, and autonomic regions of spinal segments ( L1 - L2 and L6 - S1) which receive afferent inputs from the bladder, urethra, and ureter.	[]
Fos - IR in the spinal cord was not changed in rats receiving chronic CYP treatment ( n = 15, 75 mg / kg, i. p., every 3rd day for 2 weeks).	[]
In control animals and in animals treated acutely with CYP, only small numbers of NOS - IR cells ( 0. 5 - 0. 7 cell profiles / sections) were detected in the L6 - S1 dorsal root ganglia ( DRG).	[]
Chronic CYP administration significantly ( P < or =. 002) increased bladder weight by 60% and increased ( 7 - to 11 - fold) the numbers of NOS - immunoreactive ( IR) afferent neurons in the L6 - S1 DRG.	[]
A small increase ( 1. 5 - fold) also occurred in the L1 DRG, but no change was detected in the L2 and L5 DRG.	[]
Bladder afferent cells in the L6 - S1 DRG labeled by Fluorogold ( 40 microliters) injected into the bladder wall did not exhibit NOS - IR in control animals; however, following chronic CYP administration, a significant percentage of bladder afferent neurons were NOS - IR: L6 ( 19. 8 + / - 4. 6%) and S1 ( 25. 3 + / - 2. 9%).	[]
These results indicate that neuronal gene expression in visceral sensory pathways can be upregulated by chemical irritation of afferent receptors in the urinary tract and / or that pathological changes in the urinary tract can initiate chemical signals that alter the chemical properties of visceral afferent neurons.

In the presence of coronary artery stenosis, 3 - min periods of intracoronary ISO infusion ( 10 ng / kg / min) increased heart rate and maximal rate of left ventricular pressure rise, which resulted in a decrease in percentage segmental shortening and ST - segment elevation of the epicardial electrocardiogram.

Both CD - 832 and diltiazem, but not nifedipine, significantly reduced the increase in heart rate induced by ISO infusion.	[]
In contrast to nifedipine, CD - 832 ( 10 micrograms / kg / min) prevented the decrease in percentage segmental shortening from 32 + / - 12% to 115 + / - 26% of the control value ( P <. 01) and ST - segment elevation from 5. 6 + / - 1. 0 mV to 1. 6 + / - 1. 3 mV ( P <. 01) at 3 min after ISO infusion with stenosis.

The improvement in GFR was not associated with enhanced glomerular hypertrophy or increased segmental glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial injury, or renal cortical malondialdehyde content.

In normal rats with intact kidneys, rhIGF - I administration ( n = 4) did not alter weight gain, blood pressure, proteinuria, GFR, glomerular planar area, renal cortical malondialdehyde content, or glomerular or tubulointerstitial damage, compared with untreated animals ( n = 4).

rhIGF - I treatment reduced the steady state renal IGF - I mRNA level but did not modify gene expression of the IGF - I or GH receptors.	[]
We conclude that: 1) administration of rhIGF - I improves growth and GFR in rats with chronic PAN nephropathy and 2) unlike rhGH, long - term use of rhIGF - I does not worsen renal functional and structural injury in this disease model.

Given that apomorphine inhibits passive avoidance retention when given during training or in a defined 10 - 12h post - training period, we evaluated the ability of nefiracetam to attenuate amnesia induced by dopaminergic agonism.

A step - down passive avoidance paradigm was employed and nefiracetam ( 3 mg / kg) and apomorphine ( 0. 5 mg / kg) were given alone or in combination during training and at the 10 - 12h post - training period of consolidation.	[]
Co - administration of nefiracetam and apomorphine during training or 10h thereafter produced no significant anti - amnesic effect.	[]
However, administration of nefiracetam during training completely reversed the amnesia induced by apomorphine at the 10h post - training time and the converse was also true.

These effects were not mediated by a dopaminergic mechanism as nefiracetam, at millimolar concentrations, failed to displace either [ 3H] SCH 23390 or [ 3H] spiperone binding from D1 or D2 dopamine receptor subtypes, respectively.	[]
It is suggested that nefiracetam augments molecular processes in the early stages of events which ultimately lead to consolidation of memory.	[]

Ninety - three rats were randomly divided into three groups.	[]
The exercise - isoproterenol ( E - 1) and exercise control ( EC) groups exercised daily for thirty days on a treadmill at 1 mph, 2% grade while animals of the sedentary - isoproterenol ( S - I) group remained sedentary.	[]
Eight animals were assigned to the sedentary control ( SC) group which remained sedentary throughout the experimental period.	[]
Forty - eight hours after the final exercise period, S - I and E - I animals received a single subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol ( 250 mg / kg body weight).	[]
Animals of the S - I group exhibited significantly ( Pp less than 0. 05) greater mortality from the effects of isoproterenol than animals of the E - I group.	[]
Serum CPK activity for E - I animals was significantly ( p less than 0. 05) greater than for animals in the S - I and EC groups twenty hours following isoproterenol injection.	[]
No statistically significant differences were observed between the two isoproterenol treated groups for severity of the induced lesions, changes in heart weight, or heart weight to body weight ratios.	[]
The results indicated that exercise reduced the mortality associated with the effects of large dosages of isoproterenol but had little on the severity of the infarction.

Human corticotropin - releasing hormone ( hCRH) and thyrotropin - releasing hormone ( TRH) are known to stimulate ventilation after i. v. administration in humans.	[]
In a placebo - controlled, single - blind study we aimed to clarify if both peptides act by altering central chemosensitivity.	[]
Two subsequent CO2 - rebreathing tests were performed in healthy young volunteers.	[]
During the first test 0. 9% NaCl was given i. v.; during the second test 200 micrograms of hCRH ( n = 12) or 400 micrograms of TRH ( n = 6) was administered i. v. Nine subjects received 0. 9% NaCl i. v. during both rebreathing manoeuvres.	[]
The CO2 - response curves for the two tests were compared within the same subject.	[]
In the hCRH group a marked parallel shift of the CO2 - response curve to the left was observed after hCRH ( P < 0. 01).	[]
The same effect occurred following TRH but was less striking ( P = 0. 05).	[]
hCRH and TRH caused a reduction in the CO2 threshold.	[]
The CO2 - response curves in the control group were nearly identical.	[]
The results indicate an additive effect of both releasing hormones on the hypercapnic ventilatory response in humans, presumably independent of central chemosensitivity.

We performed a single - blind, placebo - controlled study to assess its effectiveness and safety in Chinese hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg) carriers.	[]
Forty - two Chinese HBsAg carriers were randomized to receive placebo ( 6 patients) or lamivudine orally in dosages of 25 mg, 100 mg, or 300 mg daily ( 12 patients for each dosage).	[]
The drug was given for 4 weeks.	[]
The patients were closely monitored clinically, biochemically, and serologically up to 4 weeks after drug treatment.	[]
All 36 patients receiving lamivudine had a decrease in hepatitis B virus ( HBV) DNA values of > 90% ( P <. 001 compared with placebo).	"hepatitis B	55	66	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hepatitis B"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Although 25 mg of lamivudine was slightly less effective than 100 mg ( P =. 011) and 300 mg ( P =. 005), it still induced 94% suppression of HBV DNA after the fourth week of therapy.	[]
HBV DNA values returned to pretreatment levels within 4 weeks of cessation of therapy.	[]
There was no change in the hepatitis B e antigen status or in aminotransferase levels.	"hepatitis B	27	38	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hepatitis B"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
No serious adverse events were observed.	[]
In conclusion, a 4 - week course of lamivudine was safe and effective in suppression of HBV DNA in Chinese HBsAg carriers.	[]
The suppression was > 90% but reversible.	[]
Studies with long - term lamivudine administration should be performed to determine if prolonged suppression of HBV DNA can be achieved.	[]

BACKGROUND: Four studies published since December, 1995, reported that the incidence of venous thromboembolism ( VTE) was higher in women who used oral contraceptives ( OCs) containing the third - generation progestagens gestodene or desogestrel than in users of OCs containing second - generation progestagens.

However, confounding and bias in the design of these studies may have affected the findings.	[]
The aim of our study was to re - examine the association between risk of VTE and OC use with a different study design and analysis to avoid some of the bias and confounding of the earlier studies.	"VTE	73	76	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""VTE"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
METHODS: We used computer records of patients from 143 general practices in the UK.	[]
The study was based on the medical records of about 540, 000 women born between 1941 and 1981.	[]
All women who had a recorded diagnosis of deep - vein thrombosis, venous thrombosis not otherwise specified, or pulmonary embolus during the study period, and who had been treated with an anticoagulant were identified as potential cases of VTE.	"deep - vein thrombosis	42	64	Disease/Disorder"	"venous thrombosis	66	83	Disease/Disorder"	"VTE	240	243	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""deep - vein thrombosis"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""venous thrombosis"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""VTE"", ""start_span"": 240, ""end_span"": 243, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
We did a cohort analysis to estimate and compare incidence of VTE in users of the main OC preparations, and a nested case - control study to calculate the odds ratios of VTE associated with use of different types of OC, after adjustment for potential confounding factors.	"VTE	62	65	Disease/Disorder"	"VTE	62	65	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""VTE"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""VTE"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In the case - control study, we matched cases to controls by exact year of birth, practice, and current use of OCs.	[]
We used a multiple logistic regression model that included body - mass index, number of cycles, change in type of OC prescribed within 3 months of the event, previous pregnancy, and concurrent disease.	[]
FINDINGS: 85 women met the inclusion criteria for VTE, two of whom were users of progestagen - only OCs.	"VTE	50	53	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""VTE"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Of the 83 cases of VTE associated with use of combined OCs, 43 were recorded as deep - vein thrombosis, 35 as pulmonary thrombosis, and five as venous thrombosis not otherwise specified.

The crude rate of VTE per 10, 000 woman - years was 4. 10 in current users of any OC, 3. 10 in users of second - generation OCs, and 4. 96 in users of third - generation preparations.	"VTE	18	21	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""VTE"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
After adjustment for age, the rate ratio of VTE in users of third - generation relative to second - generation OCs was 1. 68 ( 95% CI 1. 04 - 2. 75).	"VTE	44	47	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""VTE"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Logistic regression showed no significant difference in the risk of VTE between users of third - generation and second - generation OCs.	"VTE	68	71	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""VTE"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Among users of third - generation progestagens, the risk of VTE was higher in users of desogestrel with 20 g ethinyloestradiol than in users of gestodene or desogestrel with 30 g ethinyloestradiol.	"VTE	60	63	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""VTE"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
With all second - generation OCs as the reference, the odds ratios for VTE were 3. 49 ( 1. 21 - 10. 12) for desogestrel plus 20 g ethinyloestradiol and 1. 18 ( 0. 66 - 2. 17) for the other third - generation progestagens.	"VTE	71	74	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""VTE"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
INTERPRETATION: The previously reported increase in odds ratio associated with third - generation OCs when compared with second - generation products is likely to have been the result of residual confounding by age.	[]
The increased odds ratio associated with products containing 20 micrograms ethinyloestradiol and desogestrel compared with the 30 micrograms product is biologically implausible, and is likely to be the result of preferential prescribing and, thus, confounding.	[]

The negative mucosal potential: separating central and peripheral effects of NSAIDs in man.	[]
OBJECTIVE: We wanted to test whether assessment of both a central pain - related signal ( chemo - somatosensory evoked potential, CSSEP) and a concomitantly recorded peripheral signal ( negative mucosal potential, NMP) allows for separation of central and peripheral effects of NSAIDs.	"pain	66	70	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""pain"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
For this purpose, experimental conditions were created in which NSAIDs had previously been observed to produce effects on phasic and tonic pain by either central or peripheral mechanisms.	"pain	139	143	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""pain"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
METHODS: According to a double - blind, randomised, controlled, threefold cross - over design, 18 healthy subjects ( 11 males, 7 females; mean age 26 years) received either placebo, 400 mg ibuprofen, or 800 mg ibuprofen.	[]
Phasic pain was applied by means of short pulses of CO2 to the nasal mucosa ( stimulus duration 500 ms, interval approximately 60 s), and tonic pain was induced in the nasal cavity by means of dry air of controlled temperature, humidity and flow rate ( 22 degrees C, 0% relative humidity, 145 ml. s - 1).

Both CSSEPs as central and NMPs as peripheral correlates of pain were obtained in response to the CO2 stimuli.	"pain	60	64	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""pain"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

RESULTS: As described earlier, administration of ibuprofen was followed by a decrease in tonic pain but - relative to placebo - an increase in correlates of phasic pain, indicating a specific effect of ibuprofen on the interaction between the pain stimuli under these special experimental conditions.

Based on the similar behaviour of CSSEP and NMP, it was concluded that the pharmacological process underlying this phenomenon was localised in the periphery.	[]
By means of the simultaneous recording of interrelated peripheral and central electrophysiologic correlates of nociception, it was possible to separate central and peripheral effects of an NSAID.	[]
The major advantage of this pain model is the possibility of obtaining peripheral pain - related activity directly using a non - invasive technique in humans.

Effects of the intracoronary infusion of cocaine on left ventricular systolic and diastolic function in humans.	[]
BACKGROUND: In dogs, a large amount of intravenous cocaine causes a profound deterioration of left ventricular ( LV) systolic function and an increase in LV end - diastolic pressure.	[]
This study was done to assess the influence of a high intracoronary cocaine concentration on LV systolic and diastolic function in humans.	[]
METHODS AND RESULTS: In 20 patients ( 14 men and 6 women aged 39 to 72 years) referred for cardiac catheterization for the evaluation of chest pain, we measured heart rate, systemic arterial pressure, LV pressure and its first derivative ( dP / dt), and LV volumes and ejection fraction before and during the final 2 to 3 minutes of a 15 - minute intracoronary infusion of saline ( n = 10, control subjects) or cocaine hydrochloride 1 mg / min ( n = 10).	"chest pain	137	147	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""chest pain"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 147, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
No variable changed with saline.	[]
With cocaine, the drug concentration in blood obtained from the coronary sinus was 3. 0 + / - 0. 4 ( mean + / - SD) mg / L, similar in magnitude to the blood cocaine concentration reported in abusers dying of cocaine intoxication.	[]
Cocaine induced no significant change in heart rate, LV dP / dt ( positive or negative), or LV end - diastolic volume, but it caused an increase in systolic and mean arterial pressures, LV end - diastolic pressure, and LV end - systolic volume, as well as a decrease in LV ejection fraction.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: In humans, the intracoronary infusion of cocaine sufficient in amount to achieve a high drug concentration in coronary sinus blood causes a deterioration of LV systolic and diastolic performance.

On the other hand, the pressor response to i. c. carbachol ( 1 mug) was almost completely blocked by i. c. atropine ( 3 mug) or hexamethonium ( 500 mug), and significantly reduced by i. c. chlorpromazine ( 50 mug) but significantly potentiated by i. c. desmethylimipramine ( 30 mug).	[]
The pressor response to i. c. carbachol ( 1 mug) remained unchanged after sectioning of the bilateral cervical vagal nerves but disappeared after sectioning of the spinal cord ( C7 - C8).	[]

Differential effects of 17alpha - ethinylestradiol on the neutral and acidic pathways of bile salt synthesis in the rat.	[]
Effects of 17alpha - ethinylestradiol ( EE) on the neutral and acidic biosynthetic pathways of bile salt ( BS) synthesis were evaluated in rats with an intact enterohepatic circulation and in rats with long - term bile diversion to induce BS synthesis.	[]
For this purpose, bile salt pool composition, synthesis of individual BS in vivo, hepatic activities, and expression levels of cholesterol 7alpha - hydroxylase ( CYP7A), and sterol 27 - hydroxylase ( CYP27), as well as of other enzymes involved in BS synthesis, were analyzed in rats treated with EE ( 5 mg / kg, 3 days) or its vehicle.	[]
BS pool size was decreased by 27% but total BS synthesis was not affected by EE in intact rats.	[]
Synthesis of cholate was reduced by 68% in EE - treated rats, while that of chenodeoxycholate was increased by 60%.	[]
The recently identified Delta22 - isomer of beta - muricholate contributed for 5. 4% and 18. 3% ( P < 0. 01) to the pool in control and EE - treated rats, respectively, but could not be detected in bile after exhaustion of the pool.	[]
A clear reduction of BS synthesis was found in bile - diverted rats treated with EE, yet biliary BS composition was only minimally affected.	[]
Activity of CYP7A was decreased by EE in both intact and bile - diverted rats, whereas the activity of the CYP27 was not affected.	[]
Hepatic mRNA levels of CYP7A were significantly reduced by EE in bile - diverted rats only; CYP27 mRNA levels were not affected by EE.	[]
In addition, mRNA levels of sterol 12alpha - hydroxylase and lithocholate 6beta - hydroxylase were increased by bile diversion and suppressed by EE.	[]
This study shows that 17alpha - ethinylestradiol ( EE) - induced intrahepatic cholestasis in rats is associated with selective inhibition of the neutral pathway of bile salt ( BS) synthesis.

Our findings indicate that sustained - release nifedipine is useful for hypertensive psoriatic patients under long - term treatment with cyclosporin A, but that these patients should be monitored for gingival hyperplasia.
