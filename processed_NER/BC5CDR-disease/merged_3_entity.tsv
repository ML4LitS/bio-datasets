In TD group, three patients developed decreased auditory function, of which one presented with an auditory loss of - 30 dB, whereas in the OD group only one patient presented decreased auditory function.	decreased auditory function,38,65,Disease/Disorder	auditory loss,98,111,Disease/Disorder	decreased auditory function,175,202,Disease/Disorder	"[{""token"": ""decreased auditory function"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""auditory loss"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""decreased auditory function"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 202, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"	train
High doses of isoniazid increase hypotension induced by vasodilators and change the accompanying reflex tachycardia to bradycardia, an interaction attributed to decreased synthesis of brain gamma - aminobutyric acid ( GABA).	hypotension,33,44,Disease/Disorder	tachycardia,104,115,Disease/Disorder	bradycardia,119,130,Disease/Disorder	"[{""token"": ""hypotension"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""tachycardia"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""bradycardia"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"	train
Our results indicated that 1) treatment of mice with ADR caused cardiovascular arrhythmias characterized by bradycardia, extension of ventricular depolarization time ( tQRS), and failure of QRS at high concentrations ( 10 - 14 mg / kg body weight cumulative dose); 2) the heart mitochondria underwent swelling, fusion, dissolution, and / or disruption of mitochondrial cristae after several weeks of treatment.	cardiovascular arrhythmias,64,90,Disease/Disorder	bradycardia,108,119,Disease/Disorder	swelling,301,309,Disease/Disorder	"[{""token"": ""cardiovascular arrhythmias"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""bradycardia"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""swelling"", ""start_span"": 301, ""end_span"": 309, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"	train
