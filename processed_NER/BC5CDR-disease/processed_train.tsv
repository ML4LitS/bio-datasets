OBJECTIVES: The United Kingdom Parkinson ' s Disease Research Group ( UKPDRG) trial found an increased mortality in patients with Parkinson ' s disease ( PD) randomized to receive 10 mg selegiline per day and L - dopa compared with those taking L - dopa alone.	"Parkinson ' s Disease	31	52	Disease/Disorder"	"Parkinson ' s disease	130	151	Disease/Disorder"	"PD	72	74	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Parkinson ' s Disease"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""Parkinson ' s disease"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PD"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Recently, we found that therapy with selegiline and L - dopa was associated with selective systolic orthostatic hypotension which was abolished by withdrawal of selegiline.

This unwanted effect on postural blood pressure was not the result of underlying autonomic failure.	[]
The aims of this study were to confirm our previous findings in a separate cohort of patients and to determine the time course of the cardiovascular consequences of stopping selegiline in the expectation that this might shed light on the mechanisms by which the drug causes orthostatic hypotension.

RESULTS: Head - up tilt caused systolic orthostatic hypotension which was marked in six of 20 PD patients on selegiline, one of whom lost consciousness with unrecordable blood pressures.

Tetrandrine ( TET) and fangchinoline ( FAN) are two naturally occurring analogues with a bisbenzylisoquinoline structure.	[]
The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of TET and FAN on the experimental thrombosis induced by collagen plus epinephrine ( EP) in mice, and platelet aggregation and blood coagulation in vitro.

In the in vivo study, the administration ( 50 mg / kg, i. p.) of TET and FAN in mice showed the inhibition of thrombosis by 55% and 35%, respectively, while acetylsalicylic acid ( ASA, 50 mg / kg, i. p.), a positive control, showed only 30% inhibition.	"thrombosis	110	120	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""thrombosis"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In the vitro human platelet aggregations induced by the agonists used in tests, TET and FAN showed the inhibitions dose dependently.	"platelet aggregations	19	40	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""platelet aggregations"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In addition, neither TET nor FAN showed any anticoagulation activities in the measurement of the activated partial thromboplastin time ( APTT), prothrombin time ( PT) and thrombin time ( TT) using human - citrated plasma.	[]
These results suggest that antithrombosis of TET and FAN in mice may be mainly related to the antiplatelet aggregation activities.	[]

The first series of experiments examined the influence of age and growth status on artery calcification in Warfarin - treated rats.	"artery calcification	83	103	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""artery calcification"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Treatment for 2 weeks with Warfarin caused massive focal calcification of the artery media in 20 - day - old rats and less extensive focal calcification in 42 - day - old rats.

In contrast, no artery calcification could be detected in 10 - month - old adult rats even after 4 weeks of Warfarin treatment.	"artery calcification	16	36	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""artery calcification"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
To directly examine the importance of growth to Warfarin - induced artery calcification in animals of the same age, 20 - day - old rats were fed for 2 weeks either an ad libitum diet or a 6 - g / d restricted diet that maintains weight but prevents growth.	"artery calcification	67	87	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""artery calcification"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Concurrent treatment of both dietary groups with Warfarin produced massive focal calcification of the artery media in the ad libitum - fed rats but no detectable artery calcification in the restricted - diet, growth - inhibited group.	"calcification of the artery	81	108	Disease/Disorder"	"artery calcification	162	182	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""calcification of the artery"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""artery calcification"", ""start_span"": 162, ""end_span"": 182, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Although the explanation for the association between artery calcification and growth status cannot be determined from the present study, there was a relationship between higher serum phosphate and susceptibility to artery calcification, with 30% higher levels of serum phosphate in young, ad libitum - fed rats compared with either of the groups that was resistant to Warfarin - induced artery calcification, ie, the 10 - month - old rats and the restricted - diet, growth - inhibited young rats.	"artery calcification	53	73	Disease/Disorder"	"artery calcification	53	73	Disease/Disorder"	"artery calcification	53	73	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""artery calcification"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""artery calcification"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""artery calcification"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
This observation suggests that increased susceptibility to Warfarin - induced artery calcification could be related to higher serum phosphate levels.	"artery calcification	78	98	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""artery calcification"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The second set of experiments examined the possible synergy between vitamin D and Warfarin in artery calcification.	"artery calcification	94	114	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""artery calcification"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
High doses of vitamin D are known to cause calcification of the artery media in as little as 3 to 4 days.	"calcification of the artery	43	70	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""calcification of the artery"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
High doses of the vitamin K antagonist Warfarin are also known to cause calcification of the artery media, but at treatment times of 2 weeks or longer yet not at 1 week.	"calcification of the artery	72	99	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""calcification of the artery"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In the current study, we investigated the synergy between these 2 treatments and found that concurrent Warfarin administration dramatically increased the extent of calcification in the media of vitamin D - treated rats at 3 and 4 days.	"calcification	164	177	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""calcification"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 177, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
There was a close parallel between the effect of vitamin D dose on artery calcification and the effect of vitamin D dose on the elevation of serum calcium, which suggests that vitamin D may induce artery calcification through its effect on serum calcium.	"artery calcification	67	87	Disease/Disorder"	"artery calcification	67	87	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""artery calcification"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""artery calcification"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Because Warfarin treatment had no effect on the elevation in serum calcium produced by vitamin D, the synergy between Warfarin and vitamin D is probably best explained by the hypothesis that Warfarin inhibits the activity of matrix Gla protein as a calcification inhibitor.	"calcification	249	262	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""calcification"", ""start_span"": 249, ""end_span"": 262, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
High levels of matrix Gla protein are found at sites of artery calcification in rats treated with vitamin D plus Warfarin, and chemical analysis showed that the protein that accumulated was indeed not gamma - carboxylated.	"artery calcification	56	76	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""artery calcification"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
These observations indicate that although the gamma - carboxyglutamate residues of matrix Gla protein are apparently required for its function as a calcification inhibitor, they are not required for its accumulation at calcification sites.	"calcification	148	161	Disease/Disorder"	"calcification	148	161	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""calcification"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""calcification"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Test conditions influence the response to a drug challenge in rodents.	[]
These studies were conducted to examine the differential response to a drug challenge under varied experimental test conditions routinely employed to study drug - induced behavioral and neurophysiological responses in rodents.	[]
Apomorphine, a nonselective dopamine agonist, was selected due to its biphasic behavioral effects, its ability to induce hypothermia, and to produce distinct changes to dopamine turnover in the rodent brain.	"hypothermia	121	132	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hypothermia"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
From such experiments there is evidence that characterization and detection of apomorphine - induced activity in rodents critically depends upon the test conditions employed.	[]
In rats, detection of apomorphine - induced hyperactivity was facilitated by a period of acclimatization to the test conditions.	"hyperactivity	44	57	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hyperactivity"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Moreover, test conditions can impact upon other physiological responses to apomorphine such as drug - induced hypothermia.	"hypothermia	110	121	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hypothermia"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In mice, apomorphine produced qualitatively different responses under novel conditions when compared to those behaviors elicited in the home test cage.	[]
Drug - induced gross activity counts were increased in the novel exploratory box only, while measures of stereotypic behavior were similar in both.	[]
By contrast, apomorphine - induced locomotion was more prominent in the novel exploratory box.	[]
Dopamine turnover ratios ( DOPAC: DA and HVA: DA) were found to be lower in those animals exposed to the exploratory box when compared to their home cage counterparts.	[]
However, apomorphine - induced reductions in striatal dopamine turnover were detected in both novel and home cage environments.	[]
The implications of these findings are discussed with particular emphasis upon conducting psychopharmacological challenge tests in rodents.	[]
Hemolysis of human erythrocytes induced by tamoxifen is related to disruption of membrane structure.	"Hemolysis	0	9	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Hemolysis"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Tamoxifen ( TAM), the antiestrogenic drug most widely prescribed in the chemotherapy of breast cancer, induces changes in normal discoid shape of erythrocytes and hemolytic anemia.	"breast cancer	88	101	Disease/Disorder"	"hemolytic anemia	163	179	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""breast cancer"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""hemolytic anemia"", ""start_span"": 163, ""end_span"": 179, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
This work evaluates the effects of TAM on isolated human erythrocytes, attempting to identify the underlying mechanisms on TAM - induced hemolytic anemia and the involvement of biomembranes in its cytostatic action mechanisms.	"hemolytic anemia	137	153	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hemolytic anemia"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
TAM induces hemolysis of erythrocytes as a function of concentration.	"hemolysis	12	21	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hemolysis"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The extension of hemolysis is variable with erythrocyte samples, but 12. 5 microM TAM induces total hemolysis of all tested suspensions.	"hemolysis	17	26	Disease/Disorder"	"hemolysis	17	26	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hemolysis"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""hemolysis"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Despite inducing extensive erythrocyte lysis, TAM does not shift the osmotic fragility curves of erythrocytes.	[]
The hemolytic effect of TAM is prevented by low concentrations of alpha - tocopherol ( alpha - T) and alpha - tocopherol acetate ( alpha - TAc) ( inactivated functional hydroxyl) indicating that TAM - induced hemolysis is not related to oxidative membrane damage.	"hemolytic	4	13	Disease/Disorder"	"hemolysis	209	218	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hemolytic"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""hemolysis"", ""start_span"": 209, ""end_span"": 218, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
This was further evidenced by absence of oxygen consumption and hemoglobin oxidation both determined in parallel with TAM - induced hemolysis.	"hemolysis	132	141	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hemolysis"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Furthermore, it was observed that TAM inhibits the peroxidation of human erythrocytes induced by AAPH, thus ruling out TAM - induced cell oxidative stress.	[]
Hemolysis caused by TAM was not preceded by the leakage of K ( +) from the cells, also excluding a colloid - osmotic type mechanism of hemolysis, according to the effects on osmotic fragility curves.	"Hemolysis	0	9	Disease/Disorder"	"hemolysis	135	144	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Hemolysis"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""hemolysis"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
However, TAM induces release of peripheral proteins of membrane - cytoskeleton and cytosol proteins essentially bound to band 3.	[]
Either alpha - T or alpha - TAc increases membrane packing and prevents TAM partition into model membranes.	[]
These effects suggest that the protection from hemolysis by tocopherols is related to a decreased TAM incorporation in condensed membranes and the structural damage of the erythrocyte membrane is consequently avoided.	"hemolysis	47	56	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hemolysis"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Therefore, TAM - induced hemolysis results from a structural perturbation of red cell membrane, leading to changes in the framework of the erythrocyte membrane and its cytoskeleton caused by its high partition in the membrane.	"hemolysis	25	34	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hemolysis"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
These defects explain the abnormal erythrocyte shape and decreased mechanical stability promoted by TAM, resulting in hemolytic anemia.	"hemolytic anemia	118	134	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hemolytic anemia"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Additionally, since membrane leakage is a final stage of cytotoxicity, the disruption of the structural characteristics of biomembranes by TAM may contribute to the multiple mechanisms of its anticancer action.	[]
Changes of sodium and ATP affinities of the cardiac ( Na, K) - ATPase during and after nitric oxide deficient hypertension.	"hypertension	110	122	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hypertension"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In the cardiovascular system, NO is involved in the regulation of a variety of functions.	[]
Inhibition of NO synthesis induces sustained hypertension.	"hypertension	45	57	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hypertension"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In several models of hypertension, elevation of intracellular sodium level was documented in cardiac tissue.	"hypertension	21	33	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hypertension"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
To assess the molecular basis of disturbances in transmembraneous transport of Na +, we studied the response of cardiac ( Na, K) - ATPase to NO - deficient hypertension induced in rats by NO - synthase inhibition with 40 mg / kg / day N ( G) - nitro - L - arginine methyl ester ( L - NAME) for 4 four weeks.	"hypertension	156	168	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hypertension"", ""start_span"": 156, ""end_span"": 168, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
After 4 - week administration of L - NAME, the systolic blood pressure ( SBP) increased by 36%.	[]
Two weeks after terminating the treatment, the SBP recovered to control value.	[]
When activating the ( Na, K) - ATPase with its substrate ATP, no changes in Km and Vmax values were observed in NO - deficient rats.	[]
During activation with Na +, the Vmax remained unchanged, however the K ( Na) increased by 50%, indicating a profound decrease in the affinity of the Na + - binding site in NO - deficient rats.	[]
After recovery from hypertension, the activity of ( Na, K) - ATPase increased, due to higher affinity of the ATP - binding site, as revealed from the lowered Km value for ATP.	"hypertension	20	32	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hypertension"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The K ( Na) value for Na + returned to control value.	[]
Inhibition of NO - synthase induced a reversible hypertension accompanied by depressed Na + - extrusion from cardiac cells as a consequence of deteriorated Na + - binding properties of the ( Na, K) - ATPase.

After recovery of blood pressure to control values, the extrusion of Na + from cardiac cells was normalized, as revealed by restoration of the ( Na, K) - ATPase activity.	[]
Effects of long - term pretreatment with isoproterenol on bromocriptine - induced tachycardia in conscious rats.	"tachycardia	82	93	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tachycardia"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
It has been shown that bromocriptine - induced tachycardia, which persisted after adrenalectomy, is ( i) mediated by central dopamine D2 receptor activation and ( ii) reduced by 5 - day isoproterenol pretreatment, supporting therefore the hypothesis that this effect is dependent on sympathetic outflow to the heart.	"tachycardia	47	58	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tachycardia"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Isoproterenol pretreatment for 15 days caused cardiac hypertrophy without affecting baseline blood pressure and heart rate.	"cardiac hypertrophy	46	65	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cardiac hypertrophy"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In control rats, intravenous bromocriptine ( 150 microg / kg) induced significant hypotension and tachycardia.

Bromocriptine - induced hypotension was unaffected by isoproterenol pretreatment, while tachycardia was reversed to significant bradycardia, an effect that was partly reduced by i. v. domperidone ( 0. 5 mg / kg).	"hypotension	24	35	Disease/Disorder"	"tachycardia	88	99	Disease/Disorder"	"bradycardia	128	139	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hypotension"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""tachycardia"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""bradycardia"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Neither cardiac vagal nor sympathetic tone was altered by isoproterenol pretreatment.	[]
In isolated perfused heart preparations from isoproterenol - pretreated rats, the isoproterenol - induced maximal increase in left ventricular systolic pressure was significantly reduced, compared with saline - pretreated rats ( the EC50 of the isoproterenol - induced increase in left ventricular systolic pressure was enhanced approximately 22 - fold).	[]
These results show that 15 - day isoproterenol pretreatment not only abolished but reversed bromocriptine - induced tachycardia to bradycardia, an effect that is mainly related to further cardiac beta - adrenoceptor desensitization rather than to impairment of autonomic regulation of the heart.	"tachycardia	116	127	Disease/Disorder"	"bradycardia	131	142	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tachycardia"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""bradycardia"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
They suggest that, in normal conscious rats, the central tachycardia of bromocriptine appears to predominate and to mask the bradycardia of this agonist at peripheral dopamine D2 receptors.

A developmental analysis of clonidine ' s effects on cardiac rate and ultrasound production in infant rats.	[]
Under controlled conditions, infant rats emit ultrasonic vocalizations during extreme cold exposure and after administration of the alpha ( 2) adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine.	[]
Previous investigations have determined that, in response to clonidine, ultrasound production increases through the 2nd - week postpartum and decreases thereafter.	[]
Given that sympathetic neural dominance exhibits a similar developmental pattern, and given that clonidine induces sympathetic withdrawal and bradycardia, we hypothesized that clonidine ' s developmental effects on cardiac rate and ultrasound production would mirror each other.	"bradycardia	142	153	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""bradycardia"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Therefore, in the present experiment, the effects of clonidine administration ( 0. 5 mg / kg) on cardiac rate and ultrasound production were examined in 2 -, 8 -, 15 -, and 20 - day - old rats.	[]
Age - related changes in ultrasound production corresponded with changes in cardiovascular variables, including baseline cardiac rate and clonidine - induced bradycardia.

The epidemiological studies that assessed the risk of venous thromboembolism ( VTE) associated with newer oral contraceptives ( OC) did not distinguish between patterns of OC use, namely first - time users, repeaters and switchers.

Data from a Transnational case - control study were used to assess the risk of VTE for the latter patterns of use, while accounting for duration of use.	"VTE	79	82	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""VTE"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Over the period 1993 - 1996, 551 cases of VTE were identified in Germany and the UK along with 2066 controls.	"VTE	42	45	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""VTE"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Totals of 128 cases and 650 controls were analysed for repeat use and 135 cases and 622 controls for switching patterns.	[]
The adjusted rate ratio of VTE for repeat users of third generation OC was 0. 6 ( 95% CI: 0. 3 - 1. 2) relative to repeat users of second generation pills, whereas it was 1. 3 ( 95% CI: 0. 7 - 2. 4) for switchers from second to third generation pills relative to switchers from third to second generation pills.	"VTE	27	30	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""VTE"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
We conclude that second and third generation agents are associated with equivalent risks of VTE when the same agent is used repeatedly after interruption periods or when users are switched between the two generations of pills.

These analyses suggest that the higher risk observed for the newer OC in other studies may be the result of inadequate comparisons of pill users with different patterns of pill use.	[]

The correlation between average BP change during the first 2 days and the outcome at day 21 was analyzed.	[]
RESULTS: Two hundred sixty - five patients were included in this analysis ( n = 92, 93, and 80 for placebo, low dose, and high dose, respectively).	[]
Nimodipine treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction in systolic BP ( SBP) and diastolic BP ( DBP) from baseline compared with placebo during the first few days.

Ketamine hydrochloride was administered intravenously ( at a dose of two milligrams per kilogram of body weight) in ninety - nine of the patients and intramuscularly ( at a dose of four milligrams per kilogram of body weight) in the other fifteen.	[]
A board - certified emergency physician skilled in airway management supervised administration of the anesthetic, and the patients were monitored by a registered nurse.	[]
Any pain during the reduction was rated by the orthopaedic surgeon treating the patient according to the Children ' s Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale ( CHEOPS).

Ninety - nine percent ( sixty - eight) of the sixty - nine parents present during the reduction were pleased with the sedation and would allow it to be used again in a similar situation.	[]
Patency of the airway and independent respiration were maintained in all of the patients.	[]
Blood pressure and heart rate remained stable.	[]
Minor side effects included nausea ( thirteen patients), emesis ( eight of the thirteen patients with nausea), clumsiness ( evident as ataxic movements in ten patients), and dysphoric reaction ( one patient).

Treatments have included discontinuation or reduction of cyclosporine dose with or without concurrent plasma exchange, plasma infusion, anticoagulation, and intravenous immunoglobulin G infusion.	[]
However, for recipients of organ transplantation, removing the inciting agent is not without the attendant risk of precipitating acute rejection and graft loss.	[]
The last decade has seen the emergence of tacrolimus as a potent immunosuppressive agent with mechanisms of action virtually identical to those of cyclosporine.	[]
As a result, switching to tacrolimus has been reported to be a viable therapeutic option in the setting of cyclosporine - induced TMA.	"TMA	130	133	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""TMA"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Grape seed extract, primarily a mixture of proanthocyanidins, has been shown to modulate a wide - range of biological, pharmacological and toxicological effects which are mainly cytoprotective.	[]
This study assessed the ability of IH636 grape seed proanthocyanidin extract ( GSPE) to prevent acetaminophen ( AAP) - induced nephrotoxicity, amiodarone ( AMI) - induced lung toxicity, and doxorubicin ( DOX) - induced cardiotoxicity in mice.	"nephrotoxicity	127	141	Disease/Disorder"	"lung toxicity	171	184	Disease/Disorder"	"cardiotoxicity	219	233	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""nephrotoxicity"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""lung toxicity"", ""start_span"": 171, ""end_span"": 184, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""cardiotoxicity"", ""start_span"": 219, ""end_span"": 233, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Experimental design consisted of four groups: control ( vehicle alone), GSPE alone, drug alone and GSPE + drug.	[]
For the cytoprotection study, animals were orally gavaged 100 mg / Kg GSPE for 7 - 10 days followed by i. p. injections of organ specific three drugs ( AAP: 500 mg / Kg for 24 h; AMI: 50 mg / Kg / day for four days; DOX: 20 mg / Kg for 48 h).	[]
Parameters of study included analysis of serum chemistry ( ALT, BUN and CPK), and orderly fragmentation of genomic DNA ( both endonuclease - dependent and independent) in addition to microscopic evaluation of damage and / or protection in corresponding PAS stained tissues.	[]
Results indicate that GSPE preexposure prior to AAP, AMI and DOX, provided near complete protection in terms of serum chemistry changes ( ALT, BUN and CPK), and significantly reduced DNA fragmentation.	[]
Histopathological examination of kidney, heart and lung sections revealed moderate to massive tissue damage with a variety of morphological aberrations by all the three drugs in the absence of GSPE preexposure than in its presence.	"tissue damage	94	107	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tissue damage"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
GSPE + drug exposed tissues exhibited minor residual damage or near total recovery.	[]
Additionally, histopathological alterations mirrored both serum chemistry changes and the pattern of DNA fragmentation.	[]
Interestingly, all the drugs, such as, AAP, AMI and DOX induced apoptotic death in addition to necrosis in the respective organs which was very effectively blocked by GSPE.	"necrosis	95	103	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""necrosis"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Since AAP, AMI and DOX undergo biotransformation and are known to produce damaging radicals in vivo, the protection by GSPE may be linked to both inhibition of metabolism and / or detoxification of cytotoxic radicals.	[]
In addition, its ' presumed contribution to DNA repair may be another important attribute, which played a role in the chemoprevention process.	[]
Additionally, this may have been the first report on AMI - induced apoptotic death in the lung tissue.	[]
Taken together, these events undoubtedly establish GSPE ' s abundant bioavailability, and the power to defend multiple target organs from toxic assaults induced by structurally diverse and functionally different entities in vivo.	[]

The incidence of mood switches seemed not to differ between patients receiving an anticonvulsant and those receiving no mood stabilizer.	[]
In contrast, mood switches were less frequent in patients receiving lithium ( 15%, 4 / 26) than in patients not treated with lithium ( 44%, 8 / 18; p =. 04).	[]
The number of previous manic episodes did not affect the probability of switching, whereas a high score on the hyperthymia component of the Semistructured Affective Temperament Interview was associated with a greater risk of switching ( p =. 008).

Although such an association is of practical and theoretical importance, only one prospective study has tried to confirm it.	[]

Mild PTCR in allografts without TG did not predict renal failure or significant proteinuria after follow - up periods of between 3 months and 1 year.

CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that in transplants, there is a strong association between well - developed PTCR and TG, while the significance of mild PTCR and its predictive value in the absence of TG is unclear.

PTCR also occurs in certain native kidney diseases, though the association is not as strong as that for TG.

This case highlights the need for adequate labelling and regulation of such products.	[]
Conformationally restricted analogs of BD1008 and an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide targeting sigma1 receptors produce anti - cocaine effects in mice.	[]
Cocaine ' s ability to interact with sigma receptors suggests that these proteins mediate some of its behavioral effects.	[]
Therefore, three novel sigma receptor ligands with antagonist activity were evaluated in Swiss Webster mice: BD1018 ( 3S - 1 - [ 2 - ( 3, 4 - dichlorophenyl) ethyl] - 1, 4 - diazabicyclo [ 4. 3. 0] nonane), BD1063 ( 1 - [ 2 - ( 3, 4 - dichlorophenyl) ethyl] - 4 - methylpiperazine), and LR132 ( 1R, 2S - ( +) - cis - N - [ 2 - ( 3, 4 - dichlorophenyl) ethyl] - 2 - ( 1 - pyrrolidinyl) cyclohexylamine).	[]
Competition binding assays demonstrated that all three compounds have high affinities for sigma1 receptors.	[]
The three compounds vary in their affinities for sigma2 receptors and exhibit negligible affinities for dopamine, opioid, GABA ( A) and NMDA receptors.	[]
In behavioral studies, pre - treatment of mice with BD1018, BD1063, or LR132 significantly attenuated cocaine - induced convulsions and lethality.	"convulsions	120	131	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""convulsions"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Moreover, post - treatment with LR132 prevented cocaine - induced lethality in a significant proportion of animals.	[]
In contrast to the protection provided by the putative antagonists, the well - characterized sigma receptor agonist di - o - tolylguanidine ( DTG) and the novel sigma receptor agonist BD1031 ( 3R - 1 - [ 2 - ( 3, 4 - dichlorophenyl) ethyl] - 1, 4 - diazabicyclo [ 4. 3. 0] nonane) each worsened the behavioral toxicity of cocaine.	"toxicity	310	318	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""toxicity"", ""start_span"": 310, ""end_span"": 318, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
At doses where alone, they produced no significant effects on locomotion, BD1018, BD1063 and LR132 significantly attenuated the locomotor stimulatory effects of cocaine.	[]
To further validate the hypothesis that the anti - cocaine effects of the novel ligands involved antagonism of sigma receptors, an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide against sigma1 receptors was also shown to significantly attenuate the convulsive and locomotor stimulatory effects of cocaine.	"convulsive	233	243	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""convulsive"", ""start_span"": 233, ""end_span"": 243, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

This retrospective study examines the incidence and treatment of ESRD and chronic renal failure ( CRF) in OLTX patients.

METHODS: Patients receiving an OLTX only from June 1985 through December of 1994 who survived 6 months postoperatively were studied ( n = 834).	[]
Our prospectively collected database was the source of information.	[]
Patients were divided into three groups: Controls, no CRF or ESRD, n = 748; CRF, sustained serum creatinine > 2. 5 mg / dl, n = 41; and ESRD, n = 45.

RESULTS: At 13 years after OLTX, the incidence of severe renal dysfunction was 18. 1% ( CRF 8. 6% and ESRD 9. 5%).

Compared with control patients, CRF and ESRD patients had higher preoperative serum creatinine levels, a greater percentage of patients with hepatorenal syndrome, higher percentage requirement for dialysis in the first 3 months postoperatively, and a higher 1 - year serum creatinine.	"CRF	32	35	Disease/Disorder"	"ESRD	40	44	Disease/Disorder"	"hepatorenal syndrome	141	161	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""CRF"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""ESRD"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""hepatorenal syndrome"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis using preoperative and postoperative variables identified that an increase of serum creatinine compared with average at 1 year, 3 months, and 4 weeks postoperatively were independent risk factors for the development of CRF or ESRD with odds ratios of 2. 6, 2. 2, and 1. 6, respectively.

Overall survival from the time of OLTX was not significantly different among groups, but by year 13, the survival of the patients who had ESRD was only 28. 2% compared with 54. 6% in the control group.	"ESRD	138	142	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ESRD"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Patients developing ESRD had a 6 - year survival after onset of ESRD of 27% for the patients receiving hemodialysis versus 71. 4% for the patients developing ESRD who subsequently received kidney transplants.

CONCLUSIONS: Patients who are more than 10 years post - OLTX have CRF and ESRD at a high rate.

The development of ESRD decreases survival, particularly in those patients treated with dialysis only.	"ESRD	19	23	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ESRD"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Patients who develop ESRD have a higher preoperative and 1 - year serum creatinine and are more likely to have hepatorenal syndrome.

However, an increase of serum creatinine at various times postoperatively is more predictive of the development of CRF or ESRD.

Epileptic seizures following cortical application of fibrin sealants containing tranexamic acid in rats.	"Epileptic seizures	0	18	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Epileptic seizures"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
BACKGROUND: Fibrin sealants ( FS) derived from human plasma are frequently used in neurosurgery.	[]
In order to increase clot stability, FS typically contain aprotinin, a natural fibrinolysis inhibitor.	[]
Recently, synthetic fibrinolysis inhibitors such as tranexamic acid ( tAMCA) have been considered as substitutes for aprotinin.	[]
However, tAMCA has been shown to cause epileptic seizures.	"epileptic seizures	39	57	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""epileptic seizures"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
We wanted to study whether tAMCA retains its convulsive action if incorporated into a FS.	"convulsive	45	55	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""convulsive"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
METHOD: FS containing aprotinin or different concentrations of tAMCA ( 0. 5 - 47. 5 mg / ml) were applied to the pial surface of the cortex of anaesthetized rats.	[]
The response of the animals was evaluated using electroencephalography and by monitoring the clinical behaviour during and after recovery from anaesthesia.	[]
FINDINGS: FS containing tAMCA caused paroxysmal brain activity which was associated with distinct convulsive behaviours.	"convulsive	98	108	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""convulsive"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The degree of these seizures increased with increasing concentration of tAMCA.	"seizures	20	28	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""seizures"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Thus, FS containing 47. 5 mg / ml tAMCA evoked generalized seizures in all tested rats ( n = 6) while the lowest concentration of tAMCA ( 0. 5 mg / ml) only evoked brief episodes of jerk - correlated convulsive potentials in 1 of 6 rats.	"generalized seizures	47	67	Disease/Disorder"	"convulsive	200	210	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""generalized seizures"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""convulsive"", ""start_span"": 200, ""end_span"": 210, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In contrast, FS containing aprotinin did not evoke any paroxysmal activity.	[]
INTERPRETATION: Tranexamic acid retains its convulsive action within FS.	"convulsive	44	54	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""convulsive"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Thus, use of FS containing tAMCA for surgery within or close to the CNS may pose a substantial risk to the patient.	[]
Sequential observations of exencephaly and subsequent morphological changes by mouse exo utero development system: analysis of the mechanism of transformation from exencephaly to anencephaly.	"exencephaly	27	38	Disease/Disorder"	"exencephaly	27	38	Disease/Disorder"	"anencephaly	179	190	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""exencephaly"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""exencephaly"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""anencephaly"", ""start_span"": 179, ""end_span"": 190, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Anencephaly has been suggested to develop from exencephaly; however, there is little direct experimental evidence to support this, and the mechanism of transformation remains unclear.	"Anencephaly	0	11	Disease/Disorder"	"exencephaly	47	58	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Anencephaly"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""exencephaly"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
We examined this theory using the exo utero development system that allows direct and sequential observations of mid - to late - gestation mouse embryos.	[]
We observed the exencephaly induced by 5 - azacytidine at embryonic day 13. 5 ( E13. 5), let the embryos develop exo utero until E18. 5, and re - observed the same embryos at E18. 5.	"exencephaly	16	27	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""exencephaly"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
We confirmed several cases of transformation from exencephaly to anencephaly.	"exencephaly	50	61	Disease/Disorder"	"anencephaly	65	76	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""exencephaly"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""anencephaly"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
However, in many cases, the exencephalic brain tissue was preserved with more or less reduction during this period.	"exencephalic	28	40	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""exencephalic"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
To analyze the transformation patterns, we classified the exencephaly by size and shape of the exencephalic tissue into several types at E13. 5 and E18. 5.	"exencephaly	58	69	Disease/Disorder"	"exencephalic	95	107	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""exencephaly"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""exencephalic"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
It was found that the transformation of exencephalic tissue was not simply size - dependent, and all cases of anencephaly at E18. 5 resulted from embryos with a large amount of exencephalic tissue at E13. 5.	"exencephalic	40	52	Disease/Disorder"	"anencephaly	110	121	Disease/Disorder"	"exencephalic	40	52	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""exencephalic"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""anencephaly"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""exencephalic"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Microscopic observation showed the configuration of exencephaly at E13. 5, frequent hemorrhaging and detachment of the neural plate from surface ectoderm in the exencephalic head at E15. 5, and multiple modes of reduction in the exencephalic tissue at E18. 5.

From observations of the vasculature, altered distribution patterns of vessels were identified in the exencephalic head.	"exencephalic	102	114	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""exencephalic"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
These findings suggest that overgrowth of the exencephalic neural tissue causes the altered distribution patterns of vessels, subsequent peripheral circulatory failure and / or hemorrhaging in various parts of the exencephalic head, leading to the multiple modes of tissue reduction during transformation from exencephaly to anencephaly.

The rat biodistribution studies showed a rapid blood clearance via the kidneys.	[]
Thirty minutes after 99mTc - glucarate administration the standardised heart uptake value S ( h) UV was 4. 7 in infarcted rat heart which is six times more than in normal rats.	[]

Glomerular epithelial protein 1 ( GLEPP1) is a podocyte receptor membrane protein tyrosine phosphatase located on the apical cell membrane of visceral glomerular epithelial cell and foot processes.	[]
This receptor plays a role in regulating the structure and function of podocyte foot process.	[]
To better understand the utility of GLEPP1 as a marker of glomerular injury, the amount and distribution of GLEPP1 protein and mRNA were examined by immunohistochemistry, Western blot and RNase protection assay in a model of podocyte injury in the rat.

At day 5, GLEPP1 protein and mRNA were reduced from the normal range ( 265. 2 + / - 79. 6 x 10 ( 6) moles / glomerulus and 100%) to 15% of normal ( 41. 8 + / - 4. 8 x 10 ( 6) moles / glomerulus, p < 0. 005).	[]
This occurred in association with an increase in urinary protein content from 1. 8 + / - 1 to 99. 0 + / - 61 mg / day ( p < 0. 001).	[]
In contrast, podocalyxin did not change significantly at this time.	[]
By day 11, GLEPP1 protein and mRNA had begun to return towards baseline.	[]
By day 45 - 126, at a time when glomerular scarring was present, GLEPP1 was absent from glomerulosclerotic areas although the total glomerular content of GLEPP1 was not different from normal.	[]
We conclude that GLEPP1 expression, unlike podocalyxin, reflects podocyte injury induced by PAN.	[]
GLEPP1 expression may be a useful marker of podocyte injury.	[]

Simultaneous administration of morphine with metamizol resulted in a markedly antinociceptive potentiation and an increasing of the duration of action after a single ( 298 + / - 7 vs. 139 + / - 36 units area ( ua); P < 0. 001) and repeated administration ( 280 + / - 17 vs. 131 + / - 22 ua; P < 0. 001).	[]
Antinociceptive effect of morphine was reduced in chronically treated rats ( 39 + / - 10 vs. 18 + / - 5 au) while the combination - induced antinociception was remained similar as an acute treatment ( 298 + / - 7 vs. 280 + / - 17 au).	[]
Acute antinociceptive effects of the combination were partially prevented by 3. 2 mg / kg naloxone s. c.	[]
( P < 0. 05), suggesting the partial involvement of the opioidergic system in the synergism observed.	[]
In independent groups, morphine inhibited the intestinal transit in 48 + / - 4% and 38 + / - 4% after acute and chronic treatment, respectively, suggesting that tolerance did not develop to the constipating effects.

Although interleukin 3 ( IL - 3) and erythropoietin ( EPO) are known to act synergistically on hematopoietic cell proliferation in vitro, injection of IGF - IL - 3 and EPO in AZT - treated mice resulted in a reduction of red cells and an increase of plasma EPO levels as compared to animals treated with IGF - IL - 3 or EPO alone.	[]
We tested the hypothesis that the antagonistic effect of IL - 3 and EPO on erythroid cells may be mediated by endothelial cells.	[]
Bovine liver erythroid cells were cultured on monolayers of human bone marrow endothelial cells previously treated with EPO and IGF - IL - 3.	[]
There was a significant reduction of thymidine incorporation into both erythroid and endothelial cells in cultures pre - treated with IGF - IL - 3 and EPO.	[]
Endothelial cell culture supernatants separated by ultrafiltration and ultracentrifugation from cells treated with EPO and IL - 3 significantly reduced thymidine incorporation into erythroid cells as compared to identical fractions obtained from the media of cells cultured with EPO alone.	[]
These results suggest that endothelial cells treated simultaneously with EPO and IL - 3 have a negative effect on erythroid cell production.	[]

BACKGROUND: The septo - hippocampal cholinergic pathway has been implicated in epileptogenesis, and genetic factors influence the response to cholinergic agents, but limited data are available on cholinergic involvement in alcohol withdrawal severity.	[]
Thus, the relationship between cholinergic activity and responsiveness and alcohol withdrawal was investigated in a genetic animal model of ethanol withdrawal severity.	[]
METHODS: Cholinergic convulsant sensitivity was examined in alcohol - na ve Withdrawal Seizure - Prone ( WSP) and - Resistant ( WSR) mice.	"Seizure	87	94	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Seizure"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Hippocampal ACh also was measured during testing for handling - induced convulsions.	"convulsions	72	83	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""convulsions"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
RESULTS: Sensitivity to several convulsion endpoints induced by nicotine, carbachol, and neostigmine were significantly greater in WSR versus WSP mice.	"convulsion	32	42	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""convulsion"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In microdialysis experiments, the lines did not differ in basal release of ACh, and 50 mM KCl increased ACh output in both lines of mice.	[]
However, the increase in release of ACh produced by the first application of KCl was 2 - fold higher in WSP versus WSR mice.	[]
When hippocampal ACh was measured during testing for handling - induced convulsions, extracellular ACh was significantly elevated ( 192%) in WSP mice, but was nonsignificantly elevated ( 59%) in WSR mice.

CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that differences in cholinergic activity and postsynaptic sensitivity to cholinergic convulsants may be associated with ethanol withdrawal severity and implicate cholinergic mechanisms in alcohol withdrawal.

Male Wistar rats were implanted bilaterally with cannulae into the accumbens shell or core, and then were locally injected with GR 55562 ( an antagonist of 5 - HT1B receptors) or CP 93129 ( an agonist of 5 - HT1B receptors).	[]
Given alone to any accumbal subregion, GR 55562 ( 0. 1 - 10 microg / side) or CP 93129 ( 0. 1 - 10 microg / side) did not change basal locomotor activity.	[]
Systemic cocaine ( 10 mg / kg) significantly increased the locomotor activity of rats.	[]
GR 55562 ( 0. 1 - 10 microg / side), administered intra - accumbens shell prior to cocaine, dose - dependently attenuated the psychostimulant - induced locomotor hyperactivity.	"locomotor hyperactivity	152	175	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""locomotor hyperactivity"", ""start_span"": 152, ""end_span"": 175, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Such attenuation was not found in animals which had been injected with GR 55562 into the accumbens core.	[]
When injected into the accumbens shell ( but not the core) before cocaine, CP 93129 ( 0. 1 - 10 microg / side) enhanced the locomotor response to cocaine; the maximum effect being observed after 10 microg / side of the agonist.	[]
The later enhancement was attenuated after intra - accumbens shell treatment with GR 55562 ( 1 microg / side).	[]
Our findings indicate that cocaine induced hyperlocomotion is modified by 5 - HT1B receptor ligands microinjected into the accumbens shell, but not core, this modification consisting in inhibitory and facilitatory effects of the 5 - HT1B receptor antagonist ( GR 55562) and agonist ( CP 93129), respectively.

The aim of this study was to examine further the renal function, including morphological analysis of the kidneys of male Sprague - Dawley rats treated with either cyclosporine A ( CsA), tacrolimus ( FK506) or SRL as monotherapies or in different combinations.	[]
METHODS: For a period of 2 weeks, CsA 15 mg / kg / day ( given orally), FK506 3. 0 mg / kg / day ( given orally) or SRL 0. 4 mg / kg / day ( given intraperitoneally) was administered once a day as these doses have earlier been found to achieve a significant immunosuppressive effect in Sprague - Dawley rats.	[]
In the ' conscious catheterized rat ' model, the glomerular filtration rate ( GFR) was measured as the clearance of Cr ( EDTA).	[]
The morphological analysis of the kidneys included a semi - quantitative scoring system analysing the degree of striped fibrosis, subcapsular fibrosis and the number of basophilic tubules, plus an additional stereological analysis of the total grade of fibrosis in the cortex stained with Sirius Red.

The morphological changes presented a similar pattern.	[]
The semi - quantitative scoring was significantly worst in the group treated with CsA plus SRL ( P < 0. 001 compared with controls) and the analysis of the total grade of fibrosis also showed the highest proportion in the same group and was significantly different from controls ( P < 0. 02).

We investigated the diagnostic value of cTnI and cTnT for the diagnosis of myocardial damage in a rat model of doxorubicin ( DOX) - induced cardiomyopathy, and we examined the relationship between serial cTnI and cTnT with the development of cardiac disorders monitored by echocardiography and histological examinations in this model.

METHODS: Thirty - five Wistar rats were given 1. 5 mg / kg DOX, i. v., weekly for up to 8 weeks for a total cumulative dose of 12 mg / kg BW.	[]
Ten rats received saline as a control group.	[]
cTnI was measured with Access ( R) ( ng / ml) and a research immunoassay ( pg / ml), and compared with cTnT, CK - MB mass and CK.	[]
By using transthoracic echocardiography, anterior and posterior wall thickness, LV diameters and LV fractional shortening ( FS) were measured in all rats before DOX or saline, and at weeks 6 and 9 after treatment in all surviving rats.	[]
Histology was performed in DOX - rats at 6 and 9 weeks after the last DOX dose and in all controls.	[]
RESULTS: Eighteen of the DOX rats died prematurely of general toxicity during the 9 - week period.	"toxicity	62	70	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""toxicity"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
End - diastolic ( ED) and end - systolic ( ES) LV diameters / BW significantly increased, whereas LV FS was decreased after 9 weeks in the DOX group ( p < 0. 001).	[]
These parameters remained unchanged in controls.	[]
Histological evaluation of hearts from all rats given DOX revealed significant slight degrees of perivascular and interstitial fibrosis.	"fibrosis	127	135	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""fibrosis"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

A significant rise in cTnT was found in DOX rats after cumulative doses of 7. 5 and 12 mg / kg in comparison with baseline ( p < 0. 05).	[]
cTnT found in rats after 12 mg / kg were significantly greater than that found after 7. 5 mg / kg DOX.	[]
Maximal cTnI ( pg / ml) and cTnT levels were significantly increased in DOX rats compared with controls ( p = 0. 006, 0. 007).	[]
cTnI ( ng / ml), CK - MB mass and CK remained unchanged in DOX rats compared with controls.	[]
All markers remained stable in controls.	[]
Analysis of data revealed a significant correlation between maximal cTnT and ED and ES LV diameters / BW ( r = 0. 81 and 0. 65; p < 0. 0001).	[]
A significant relationship was observed between maximal cTnT and the extent of myocardial morphological changes, and between LV diameters / BW and histological findings.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: Among markers of ischemic injury after DOX in rats, cTnT showed the greatest ability to detect myocardial damage assessed by echocardiographic detection and histological changes.

Although there was a discrepancy between the amount of cTnI and cTnT after DOX, probably due to heterogeneity in cross - reactivities of mAbs to various cTnI and cTnT forms, it is likely that cTnT in rats after DOX indicates cell damage determined by the magnitude of injury induced and that cTnT should be a useful marker for the prediction of experimentally induced cardiotoxicity and possibly for cardioprotective experiments.

RESULTS: The age - adjusted incidence rate ratio for CPA / EE versus conventional COCs was 2. 20 [ 95% confidence interval ( CI) 1. 35 - 3. 58].	[]
Using as the reference group women who were not using oral contraception, had no recent pregnancy or menopausal symptoms, the case - control analysis gave an adjusted odds ratio ( OR ( adj)) of 7. 44 ( 95% CI 3. 67 - 15. 08) for CPA / EE use compared with an OR ( adj) of 2. 58 ( 95% CI 1. 60 - 4. 18) for use of conventional COCs.

Nephrotoxicity was assessed by measuring the concentrations of creatinine and urea in the plasma and reduced glutathione ( GSH) in the kidney cortex, and by light microscopic examination of kidney sections.	"Nephrotoxicity	0	14	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Nephrotoxicity"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The results indicated that concomitant treatment with gum Arabic and GM significantly increased creatinine and urea by about 183 and 239%, respectively ( compared to 432 and 346%, respectively, in rats treated with cellulose and GM), and decreased that of cortical GSH by 21% ( compared to 27% in the cellulose plus GM group) The GM - induced proximal tubular necrosis appeared to be slightly less severe in rats given GM together with gum Arabic than in those given GM and cellulose.

OBJECTIVE: To report 2 cases of ticlopidine - induced cholestatic hepatitis, investigate its mechanism, and compare the observed main characteristics with those of the published cases.	"cholestatic hepatitis	54	75	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cholestatic hepatitis"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
CASE SUMMARIES: Two patients developed prolonged cholestatic hepatitis after receiving ticlopidine following percutaneous coronary angioplasty, with complete remission during the follow - up period.

T - cell stimulation by therapeutic concentration of ticlopidine was demonstrated in vitro in the patients, but not in healthy controls.	[]
DISCUSSION: Cholestatic hepatitis is a rare complication of the antiplatelet agent ticlopidine; several cases have been reported but few in the English literature.

Hepatitis may develop weeks after discontinuation of the drug and may run a prolonged course, but complete remission was observed in all reported cases.	"Hepatitis	0	9	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Hepatitis"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
An objective causality assessment revealed that the adverse drug event was probably related to the use of ticlopidine.	[]
The mechanisms of this ticlopidine - induced cholestasis are unclear.	"cholestasis	45	56	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cholestasis"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Immune mechanisms may be involved in the drug ' s hepatotoxicity, as suggested by the T - cell stimulation study reported here.	"hepatotoxicity	50	64	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hepatotoxicity"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
CONCLUSIONS: Cholestatic hepatitis is a rare adverse effect of ticlopidine that may be immune mediated.	"Cholestatic hepatitis	13	34	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Cholestatic hepatitis"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Patients receiving the drug should be monitored with liver function tests along with complete blood cell counts.	[]
This complication will be observed even less often in the future as ticlopidine is being replaced by the newer antiplatelet agent clopidogrel.	[]
Epithelial sodium channel ( ENaC) subunit mRNA and protein expression in rats with puromycin aminonucleoside - induced nephrotic syndrome.	"nephrotic syndrome	119	137	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""nephrotic syndrome"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In experimental nephrotic syndrome, urinary sodium excretion is decreased during the early phase of the disease.	"nephrotic syndrome	16	34	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""nephrotic syndrome"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The molecular mechanism ( s) leading to salt retention has not been completely elucidated.	[]
The rate - limiting constituent of collecting duct sodium transport is the epithelial sodium channel ( ENaC).	[]
We examined the abundance of ENaC subunit mRNAs and proteins in puromycin aminonucleoside ( PAN) - induced nephrotic syndrome.	"nephrotic syndrome	107	125	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""nephrotic syndrome"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The time courses of urinary sodium excretion, plasma aldosterone concentration and proteinuria were studied in male Sprague - Dawley rats treated with a single dose of either PAN or vehicle.	"proteinuria	83	94	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""proteinuria"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The relative amounts of alphaENaC, betaENaC and gammaENaC mRNAs were determined in kidneys from these rats by real - time quantitative TaqMan PCR, and the amounts of proteins by Western blot.	[]
The kinetics of urinary sodium excretion and the appearance of proteinuria were comparable with those reported previously.	"proteinuria	63	74	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""proteinuria"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Sodium retention occurred on days 2, 3 and 6 after PAN injection.	[]
A significant up - regulation of alphaENaC and betaENaC mRNA abundance on days 1 and 2 preceded sodium retention on days 2 and 3.	[]
Conversely, down - regulation of alphaENaC, betaENaC and gammaENaC mRNA expression on day 3 occurred in the presence of high aldosterone concentrations, and was followed by a return of sodium excretion to control values.	[]
The amounts of alphaENaC, betaENaC and gammaENaC proteins were not increased during PAN - induced sodium retention.	[]
In conclusion, ENaC mRNA expression, especially alphaENaC, is increased in the very early phase of the experimental model of PAN - induced nephrotic syndrome in rats, but appears to escape from the regulation by aldosterone after day 3.

Sub - chronic low dose gamma - vinyl GABA ( vigabatrin) inhibits cocaine - induced increases in nucleus accumbens dopamine.	[]
RATIONALE: gamma - Vinyl GABA ( GVG) irreversibly inhibits GABA - transaminase.	[]
This non - receptor mediated inhibition requires de novo synthesis for restoration of functional GABA catabolism.	[]
OBJECTIVES: Given its preclinical success for treating substance abuse and the increased risk of visual field defects ( VFD) associated with cumulative lifetime exposure, we explored the effects of sub - chronic low dose GVG on cocaine - induced increases in nucleus accumbens ( NAcc) dopamine ( DA).	"substance abuse	55	70	Disease/Disorder"	"visual field defects	97	117	Disease/Disorder"	"VFD	120	123	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""substance abuse"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""visual field defects"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""VFD"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
METHODS: Using in vivo microdialysis, we compared acute exposure ( 450 mg / kg) to an identical sub - chronic exposure ( 150 mg / kg per day for 3 days), followed by 1 - or 3 - day washout.	[]
Finally, we examined the low dose of 150 mg / kg ( 50 mg / kg per day) using a similar washout period.	[]
RESULTS: Sub - chronic GVG exposure inhibited the effect of cocaine for 3 days, which exceeded in magnitude and duration the identical acute dose.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: Sub - chronic low dose GVG potentiates and extends the inhibition of cocaine - induced increases in dopamine, effectively reducing cumulative exposures and the risk for VFDS.	[]

Our objective was to investigate brain MR imaging findings and the utility of diffusion - weighted ( DW) imaging in organ transplant patients who developed neurologic symptoms during tacrolimus therapy.	[]
Brain MR studies, including DW imaging, were prospectively performed in 14 organ transplant patients receiving tacrolimus who developed neurologic complications.

In each patient who had abnormalities on the initial MR study, a follow - up MR study was performed 1 month later.	[]
Apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC) values on the initial MR study were correlated with reversibility of the lesions.	[]
Of the 14 patients, 5 ( 35. 7%) had white matter abnormalities, 1 ( 7. 1%) had putaminal hemorrhage, and 8 ( 57. 1%) had normal findings on initial MR images.

Among the 5 patients with white matter abnormalities, 4 patients ( 80. 0%) showed higher than normal ADC values on initial MR images, and all showed complete resolution on follow - up images.

L - arginine transport in humans with cortisol - induced hypertension.	"hypertension	57	69	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hypertension"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
A deficient L - arginine - nitric oxide system is implicated in cortisol - induced hypertension.	"hypertension	83	95	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hypertension"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
We investigate whether abnormalities in L - arginine uptake contribute to this deficiency.	[]
Eight healthy men were recruited.	[]
Hydrocortisone acetate ( 50 mg) was given orally every 6 hours for 24 hours after a 5 - day fixed - salt diet ( 150 mmol / d).	[]
Crossover studies were performed 2 weeks apart.	[]
Thirty milliliters of blood was obtained for isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells after each treatment period.	[]
L - arginine uptake was assessed in mononuclear cells incubated with L - arginine ( 1 to 300 micromol / L), incorporating 100 nmol / L [ 3H] - l - arginine for a period of 5 minutes at 37 degrees C.	[]
Forearm [ 3H] - L - arginine extraction was calculated after infusion of [ 3H] - L - arginine into the brachial artery at a rate of 100 nCi / min for 80 minutes.	[]
Deep forearm venous samples were collected for determination of L - arginine extraction.	[]
Plasma cortisol concentrations were significantly raised during the active phase ( 323 + / - 43 to 1082 + / - 245 mmol / L, P < 0. 05).	[]
Systolic blood pressure was elevated by an average of 7 mm Hg.	[]
Neither L - arginine transport into mononuclear cells ( placebo vs active, 26. 3 + / - 3. 6 vs 29. 0 + / - 2. 1 pmol / 10 000 cells per 5 minutes, respectively, at an l - arginine concentration of 300 micromol / L) nor L - arginine extraction in the forearm ( at 80 minutes, placebo vs active, 1 868 904 + / - 434 962 vs 2 013 910 + / - 770 619 disintegrations per minute) was affected by cortisol treatment; ie, that L - arginine uptake is not affected by short - term cortisol treatment.	[]
We conclude that cortisol - induced increases in blood pressure are not associated with abnormalities in the l - arginine transport system.

In ICH intrastriatally induced by 0. 014 - unit, 0. 070 - unit, and 0. 350 - unit collagenase, the amount of bleeding was measured using a hemoglobin assay developed in the present study and was compared with the morphologically determined hematoma volume.

The blood amounts and hematoma volumes were significantly correlated, and the hematoma induced by 0. 014 - unit collagenase was adequate to detect ICH deterioration.

METHODS: We used computerized pharmacy records to identify all adult psychiatric inpatients treated with clozapine ( 1995 - 96), reviewed their medical records to score incidence and severity of delirium, and tested associations with potential risk factors.

RESULTS: Subjects ( n = 139) were 72 women and 67 men, aged 40. 8 + / - 12. 1 years, hospitalized for 24. 9 + / - 23. 3 days, and given clozapine, gradually increased to an average daily dose of 282 + / - 203 mg ( 3. 45 + / - 2. 45 mg / kg) for 18. 9 + / - 16. 4 days.	[]
Delirium was diagnosed in 14 ( 10. 1% incidence, or 1. 48 cases / person - years of exposure); 71. 4% of cases were moderate or severe.	"Delirium	0	8	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Delirium"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Neuroprotective action of MPEP, a selective mGluR5 antagonist, in methamphetamine - induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity is associated with a decrease in dopamine outflow and inhibition of hyperthermia in rats.

The aim of this study was to examine the role of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 ( mGluR5) in the toxic action of methamphetamine on dopaminergic neurones in rats.	[]
Methamphetamine ( 10 mg / kg sc), administered five times, reduced the levels of dopamine and its metabolites in striatal tissue when measured 72 h after the last injection.	[]
A selective antagonist of mGluR5, 2 - methyl - 6 - ( phenylethynyl) pyridine ( MPEP; 5 mg / kg ip), when administered five times immediately before each methamphetamine injection reversed the above - mentioned methamphetamine effects.	[]
A single MPEP ( 5 mg / kg ip) injection reduced the basal extracellular dopamine level in the striatum, as well as dopamine release stimulated either by methamphetamine ( 10 mg / kg sc) or by intrastriatally administered veratridine ( 100 microM).	[]
Moreover, it transiently diminished the methamphetamine ( 10 mg / kg sc) - induced hyperthermia and reduced basal body temperature.	"hyperthermia	83	95	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hyperthermia"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
MPEP administered into the striatum at high concentrations ( 500 microM) increased extracellular dopamine levels, while lower concentrations ( 50 - 100 microM) were devoid of any effect.	[]
The results of this study suggest that the blockade of mGluR5 by MPEP may protect dopaminergic neurones against methamphetamine - induced toxicity.	"toxicity	138	146	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""toxicity"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Neuroprotection rendered by MPEP may be associated with the reduction of the methamphetamine - induced dopamine efflux in the striatum due to the blockade of extrastriatal mGluR5, and with a decrease in hyperthermia.

The present study was designed to evaluate two endogenous and one synthetic neuroactive steroid that positively modulate the gamma - aminobutyric acid ( GABA ( A)) receptor against the increase in sensitivity to the convulsant effects of cocaine engendered by repeated cocaine administration ( seizure kindling).

All of these positive GABA ( A) modulators suppressed the expression of kindled seizures, whereas only allopregnanolone and ganaxolone inhibited the development of kindling.

Allopregnanolone and pregnanolone, but not ganaxolone, also reduced cumulative lethality associated with kindling.	[]
These findings demonstrate that some neuroactive steroids attenuate convulsant and sensitizing properties of cocaine and add to a growing literature on their potential use in the modulation of effects of drugs of abuse.	[]

In contrast, both methscopolamine and neostigmine, which do not penetrate the blood - brain barrier, had no effect on the hyperactivity produced by morphine.

Pretreatment of mice with alpha - methyltyrosine ( 20 mg / kg i. p., one hour), an inhibitor of tyrosine hydroxylase, significantly decreased the activity - increasing effects of morphine.	[]
On the other hand, pretreatment with p - chlorophenylalamine ( 3 X 320 mg / kg i. p., 24 hr), a serotonin depletor, caused no significant change in the hyperactivity.	"hyperactivity	152	165	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hyperactivity"", ""start_span"": 152, ""end_span"": 165, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The study suggests that the activity - increasing effects of morphine are mediated by the release of catecholamines from adrenergic neurons in the brain.	[]
And the results are consistent with the hypothesis that morphine acts by retarding the release of acetylcholine at some central cholinergic synapses.	[]
It is also suggested from collected evidence that the activity - increasing effects of morphine in mice are mediated by mechanisms different from those which mediate the activity - increasing effects of morphine in rats.	[]

Rats with lithium - induced nephropathy were subjected to high protein ( HP) feeding, uninephrectomy ( NX) or a combination of these, in an attempt to induce glomerular hyperfiltration and further progression of renal failure.

Newborn female Wistar rats were fed a lithium - containing diet ( 50 mmol / kg) for 8 weeks and then randomized to normal diet, HP diet ( 40 vs. 19%), NX or HP + NX for another 8 weeks.	[]
Corresponding non - lithium pretreated groups were generated.	[]
When comparing all lithium treated versus non - lithium - treated groups, lithium caused a reduction in glomerular filtration rate ( GFR) without significant changes in effective renal plasma flow ( as determined by a marker secreted into the proximal tubules) or lithium clearance.	[]
Consequently, lithium pretreatment caused a fall in filtration fraction and an increase in fractional Li excretion.	[]
Lithium also caused proteinuria and systolic hypertension in absence of glomerulosclerosis.

HP failed to accentuante progression of renal failure and in fact tended to increase GFR and decrease plasma creatinine levels in lithium pretreated rats.	"renal failure	40	53	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""renal failure"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
NX caused an additive deterioration in GFR which, however, was ameliorated by HP.	[]
NX + HP caused a further rise in blood pressure in Li - pretreated rats.	[]
The results indicate that Li - induced nephropathy, even when the GFR is only modestly reduced, is associated with proteinuria and arterial systolic hypertension.

In this model of chronic renal failure the decline in GFR is not accompanied by a corresponding fall in effective renal plasma flow, which may be the functional expression of the formation of nonfiltrating atubular glomeruli.

Fusidic acid is an antibiotic with T - cell specific immunosuppressive effects similar to those of cyclosporin.	[]
Because of the need for the development of new treatments for Crohn ' s disease, a pilot study was undertaken to estimate the pharmacodynamics and tolerability of fusidic acid treatment in chronic active, therapy - resistant patients.

Fusidic acid was administered orally in a dose of 500 mg t. d. s. and the treatment was planned to last 8 weeks.	[]
The disease activity was primarily measured by a modified individual grading score.	[]
Five of 8 patients ( 63%) improved during fusidic acid treatment: 3 at two weeks and 2 after four weeks.	[]
There were no serious clinical side effects, but dose reduction was required in two patients because of nausea.	"nausea	104	110	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""nausea"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Biochemically, an increase in alkaline phosphatases was noted in 5 of 8 cases ( 63%), and the greatest increases were seen in those who had elevated levels prior to treatment.	[]

LY274614, 3SR, 4aRS, 6SR, 8aRS - 6 - [ phosphonomethyl] decahydr oisoquinoline - 3 - carboxylic acid, has been described as a potent antagonist of the N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptor.	[]
Here its ability to antagonize the prolonged depletion of dopamine in the striatum by amphetamine in iprindole - treated rats is reported.	[]
A single 18. 4 mg / kg ( i. p.) dose of ( + / -) - amphetamine hemisulfate, given to rats pretreated with iprindole, resulted in persistent depletion of dopamine in the striatum 1 week later.	[]
This prolonged depletion of dopamine in the striatum was antagonized by dizocilpine ( MK - 801, a non - competitive antagonist of NMDA receptors) or by LY274614 ( a competitive antagonist of NMDA receptors).	[]
The protective effect of LY274614 was dose - dependent, being maximum at 10 - 40 mgkg ( i. p.).	[]
A 10 mg / kg dose of LY274614 was effective in antagonizing the depletion of dopamine in the striatum, when given as long as 8 hr prior to amphetamine but not when given 24 hr prior to amphetamine.	[]
Depletion of dopamine in the striatum was also antagonized when LY274614 was given after the injection of amphetamine; LY274614 protected when given up to 4 hr after but not when given 8 or 24 hr after amphetamine.	[]
The prolonged depletion of dopamine in the striatum in mice, given multiple injections of methamphetamine, was also antagonized dose - dependently and completely by LY274614.	[]
The data strengthen the evidence that the neurotoxic effect of amphetamine and related compounds toward nigrostriatal dopamine neurons involves NMDA receptors and that LY274614 is an NMDA receptor antagonist with long - lasting in vivo effects in rats.

After a 30 - min baseline measure of locomotor activity ( day 0), animals were maintained on a cyclic diet of 12 - h deprivation followed by 12 - h access to 10% sucrose solution and chow pellets ( 12 h access starting 4 h after onset of the dark period) for 21 days.	[]
Locomotor activity was measured again for 30 min at the beginning of days 1 and 21 of sugar access.	[]
Beginning on day 22, all rats were maintained on ad libitum chow.	[]
Nine days later locomotor activity was measured in response to a single low dose of amphetamine ( 0. 5 mg / kg).	[]
The animals that had experienced cyclic sucrose and chow were hyperactive in response to amphetamine compared with four control groups ( ad libitum 10% sucrose and chow followed by amphetamine injection, cyclic chow followed by amphetamine injection, ad libitum chow with amphetamine, or cyclic 10% sucrose and chow with a saline injection).

Both the trigeminal and the cranial parasympathetic systems may be involved in mediating these dysfunctions.	[]
An experimental model was developed in the rat to measure changes in lacrimation and intracranial blood flow following noxious chemical stimulation of facial mucosa.	[]
Blood flow was monitored in arteries of the exposed cranial dura mater and the parietal cortex using laser Doppler flowmetry.	[]
Capsaicin ( 0. 01 - 1 mm) applied to oral or nasal mucosa induced increases in dural and cortical blood flow and provoked lacrimation.

These responses were blocked by systemic pre - administration of hexamethonium chloride ( 20 mg / kg).	[]
The evoked increases in dural blood flow were also abolished by topical pre - administration of atropine ( 1 mm) and [ Lys1, Pro2, 5, Arg3, 4, Tyr6] - VIP ( 0. 1 mm), a vasoactive intestinal polypeptide ( VIP) antagonist, onto the exposed dura mater.

OBJECTIVE: To assess and characterise the risk of bladder cancer, and its relation to cyclophosphamide, in patients with Wegener ' s granulomatosis.

METHODS: In the population based, nationwide Swedish Inpatient Register a cohort of 1065 patients with Wegener ' s granulomatosis, 1969 - 95, was identified.

Nested within the cohort, a matched case - control study was performed to estimate the association between cyclophosphamide and bladder cancer using odds ratios ( ORs) as relative risk.	"bladder cancer	128	142	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""bladder cancer"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In the cohort the cumulative risk of bladder cancer after Wegener ' s granulomatosis, and the relative prevalence of a history of bladder cancer at the time of diagnosis of Wegener ' s granulomatosis, were also estimated.

RESULTS: The median cumulative doses of cyclophosphamide among cases ( n = 11) and controls ( n = 25) were 113 g and 25 g, respectively.	[]
The risk of bladder cancer doubled for every 10 g increment in cyclophosphamide ( OR = 2. 0, 95% confidence interval ( CI) 0. 8 to 4. 9).	"bladder cancer	12	26	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""bladder cancer"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Treatment duration longer than 1 year was associated with an eightfold increased risk ( OR = 7. 7, 95% CI 0. 9 to 69).	[]
The absolute risk for bladder cancer in the cohort reached 10% 16 years after diagnosis of Wegener ' s granulomatosis, and a history of bladder cancer was ( non - significantly) twice as common as expected at the time of diagnosis of Wegener ' s granulomatosis.

Differential modulation by estrogen of alpha2 - adrenergic and I1 - imidazoline receptor - mediated hypotension in female rats.	"hypotension	100	111	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hypotension"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
We have recently shown that estrogen negatively modulates the hypotensive effect of clonidine ( mixed alpha2 - / I1 - receptor agonist) in female rats and implicates the cardiovascular autonomic control in this interaction.	"hypotensive	62	73	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hypotensive"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The present study investigated whether this effect of estrogen involves interaction with alpha2 - and / or I1 - receptors.	[]
Changes evoked by a single intraperitoneal injection of rilmenidine ( 600 microg / kg) or alpha - methyldopa ( 100 mg / kg), selective I1 - and alpha2 - receptor agonists, respectively, in blood pressure, hemodynamic variability, and locomotor activity were assessed in radiotelemetered sham - operated and ovariectomized ( Ovx) Sprague - Dawley female rats with or without 12 - wk estrogen replacement.	[]
Three time domain indexes of hemodynamic variability were employed: the standard deviation of mean arterial pressure as a measure of blood pressure variability and the standard deviation of beat - to - beat intervals ( SDRR) and the root mean square of successive differences in R - wave - to - R - wave intervals as measures of heart rate variability.	[]
In sham - operated rats, rilmenidine or alpha - methyldopa elicited similar hypotension that lasted at least 5 h and was associated with reductions in standard deviation of mean arterial pressure.	"hypotension	76	87	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hypotension"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
SDRR was reduced only by alpha - methyldopa.	[]
Ovx significantly enhanced the hypotensive response to alpha - methyldopa, in contrast to no effect on rilmenidine hypotension.

The enhanced alpha - methyldopa hypotension in Ovx rats was paralleled with further reduction in SDRR and a reduced locomotor activity.	"hypotension	32	43	Disease/Disorder"	"a reduced locomotor activity	106	134	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hypotension"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""a reduced locomotor activity"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Estrogen replacement ( 17beta - estradiol subcutaneous pellet, 14. 2 microg / day, 12 wk) of Ovx rats restored the hemodynamic and locomotor effects of alpha - methyldopa to sham - operated levels.	[]
These findings suggest that estrogen downregulates alpha2 - but not I1 - receptor - mediated hypotension and highlight a role for the cardiac autonomic control in alpha - methyldopa - estrogen interaction.

Pretreatment of TCR, at a dose of 0. 5 mL / 100 g bodyweight per day, orally for 30 days, prevented the increase in lipid peroxidation and activity of marker enzymes observed in isoproterenol - induced rats ( 85 mg kg ( - 1) s. c. for 2 days at an interval of 24 h).	[]
TCR prevented the isoproterenol - induced decrease in antioxidant enzymes in the heart and increased the rate of ADP - stimulated oxygen uptake and respiratory coupling ratio.	[]
TCR protected against pathological changes induced by isoproterenol in rat heart.	[]
The results show that pretreatment with TCR may be useful in preventing the damage induced by isoproterenol in rat heart.	[]

nAChRs are pentameric ion channels usually composed of alpha and beta subunits.	[]
A gene cluster comprises the alpha3, alpha5 and beta4 subunits, which coassemble to form functional receptors.	[]

BACKGROUND: In man, differences in angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE) levels, related to ACE ( I / D) genotype, are associated with renal prognosis.	[]
This raises the hypothesis that individual differences in renal ACE activity are involved in renal susceptibility to inflicted damage.	[]
Therefore, we studied the predictive effect of renal ACE activity for the severity of renal damage induced by a single injection of adriamycin in rats.	"renal damage	86	98	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""renal damage"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

BACKGROUND: A previous randomized controlled trial evaluating the use of spironolactone in heart failure patients reported a low risk of hyperkalemia ( 2%) and renal insufficiency ( 0%).

Clinical characteristics, medications, and serum chemistries at baseline and follow - up time periods were compared.	[]
RESULTS: Sixty - seven of 926 patients ( 7. 2%) required discontinuation of spironolactone due to hyperkalemia ( n = 33) or renal failure ( n = 34).

Patients who developed hyperkalemia were older and more likely to have diabetes, had higher baseline serum potassium levels and lower baseline potassium supplement doses, and were more likely to be treated with beta - blockers than controls ( n = 134).

Reserpine injection ( one dose of 1 mg / kg s. c.) every other day for 3 days caused a significant increase in vacuous chewing, tongue protrusion and duration of facial twitching, compared to the control.	[]
Haloperidol administration ( one dose of 12 mg / kg once a week s. c.) for 4 weeks caused an increase in vacuous chewing, tongue protrusion and duration of facial twitching observed in four weekly evaluations.	[]
After the treatments and behavioral observation, glutamate uptake by segments of the brain was analyzed.	[]
A decreased glutamate uptake was observed in the subcortical parts of animals treated with reserpine and haloperidol, compared to the control.	[]
Importantly, a decrease in glutamate uptake correlates negatively with an increase in the incidence of orofacial diskinesia.	"orofacial diskinesia	103	123	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""orofacial diskinesia"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

BACKGROUND: Cyclooxygenase ( COX) inhibitors are one of the most often ingested drugs during pregnancy.	[]
Unlike general toxicity data, their prenatal toxic effects were not extensively studied before.	"toxicity	15	23	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""toxicity"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The aim of the experiment was to evaluate the developmental toxicity of the non - selective ( piroxicam) and selective ( DFU; 5, 5 - dimethyl - 3 - ( 3 - fluorophenyl) - 4 - ( 4 - methylsulphonyl) phenyl - 2 ( 5H) - furanon) COX - 2 inhibitors.	"toxicity	60	68	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""toxicity"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
METHODS: Drugs were separately, orally once daily dosed to pregnant rats from day 8 to 21 ( GD1 = plug day).	[]
Doses were set at 0. 3, 3. 0 and 30. 0mg / kg for piroxicam and 0. 2, 2. 0 and 20. 0mg / kg for DFU.	[]
Fetuses were delivered on GD 21 and routinely examined.	[]
Comprehensive clinical and developmental measurements were done.	[]
The pooled statistical analysis for ventricular septal ( VSD) and midline ( MD) defects was performed for rat fetuses exposed to piroxicam, selective and non - selective COX - 2 inhibitor based on present and historic data.	[]
RESULTS: Maternal toxicity, intrauterine growth retardation, and increase of external and skeletal variations were found in rats treated with the highest dose of piroxicam.

Decrease of fetal length was the only signs of the DFU developmental toxicity observed in pups exposed to the highest compound dose.	"toxicity	69	77	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""toxicity"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Lack of teratogenicity was found in piroxicam and DFU - exposed groups.	[]
Prenatal exposure to non - selective COX inhibitors increases the risk of VSD and MD when compared to historic control but not with selective COX - 2 inhibitors.	[]
CONCLUSION: Both selective and non - selective COX - 2 inhibitors were toxic for rats fetuses when administered in the highest dose.	[]
Unlike DFU, piroxicam was also highly toxic to the dams.	[]
Prenatal exposure to selective COX - 2 inhibitors does not increase the risk of ventricular septal and midline defects in rat when compared to non - selective drugs and historic control.

Thyroid - stimulating hormone, magnesium, and potassium levels were within normal limits, urine drug screen was negative, and alcohol use was denied.	[]
However, when the patient was questioned about use of herbal products and supplements, the use of creatine monohydrate was revealed.	[]
The patient was admitted to the hospital, anticoagulated with unfractionated heparin, and given intravenous diltiazem for rate control and intravenous amiodarone for rate and rhythm control.	[]
When discharged less than 24 hours later, he was receiving metoprolol and aspirin, with follow - up plans for echocardiography and nuclear imaging to assess perfusion.	[]

Antagonists at serotonin type 6 ( 5 - HT ( 6)) receptors show activity in models of learning and memory.	[]
Although the underlying mechanism ( s) are not well understood, these effects may involve an increase in acetylcholine ( ACh) levels.	[]
The present study sought to characterize the cognitive - enhancing effects of the 5 - HT ( 6) antagonist Ro4368554 ( 3 - benzenesulfonyl - 7 - ( 4 - methyl - piperazin - 1 - yl) 1H - indole) in a rat object recognition task employing a cholinergic ( scopolamine pretreatment) and a serotonergic - ( tryptophan ( TRP) depletion) deficient model, and compared its pattern of action with that of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor metrifonate.

Initial testing in a time - dependent forgetting task employing a 24 - h delay between training and testing showed that metrifonate improved object recognition ( at 10 and 30 mg / kg, p. o.), whereas Ro4368554 was inactive.	[]
Both, Ro4368554 ( 3 and 10 mg / kg, intraperitoneally ( i. p.)) and metrifonate ( 10 mg / kg, p. o., respectively) reversed memory deficits induced by scopolamine and TRP depletion ( 10 mg / kg, i. p., and 3 mg / kg, p. o., respectively).

However, the behavioral effects of centrally administered U - II have received little attention.	[]
In the present study, we tested the effects of i. c. v. injections of U - II on behavioral, metabolic, and endocrine responses in mice.	[]
Administration of graded doses of U - II ( 1 - 10, 000 ng / mouse) provoked: ( 1) a dose - dependent reduction in the number of head dips in the hole - board test; ( 2) a dose - dependent reduction in the number of entries in the white chamber in the black - and - white compartment test, and in the number of entries in the central platform and open arms in the plus - maze test; and ( 3) a dose - dependent increase in the duration of immobility in the forced - swimming test and tail suspension test.

The effects of short - term raloxifene therapy on fibrinolysis markers: TAFI, tPA, and PAI - 1.	[]
BACKGROUND: Markers of fibrinolysis, thrombin - activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor ( TAFI), tissue - type plasminogen activator ( tPA), and plasminogen activator inhibitor - 1 ( PAI - 1) levels were studied for the evaluation of short - term effects of raloxifene administration in postmenopausal women.

Twenty - five women were given raloxifene hydrochloride ( 60 mg / day) plus calcium ( 500 mg / day).	[]
Age - matched controls ( n = 14) were given only calcium.	[]
Plasma TAFI, tPA, and PAI - 1 antigen levels were measured at baseline and after 3 months of treatment by commercially available ELISA kits.	[]
Variations of individuals were assessed by Wilcoxon ' s test.	[]
Relationship between those markers and demographic characteristics were investigated.	[]
RESULTS: Three months of raloxifene treatment was associated with a significant decrease in the plasma TAFI antigen concentrations ( 16% change, P < 0. 01), and a significant increase in tPA antigen concentrations ( 25% change, P < 0. 05).	[]

Safety profile of a nicotine lozenge compared with that of nicotine gum in adult smokers with underlying medical conditions: a 12 - week, randomized, open - label study.	[]
BACKGROUND: Nicotine polacrilex lozenges deliver 25% to 27% more nicotine compared with equivalent doses of nicotine polacrilex gum.	[]
The increased nicotine exposure from the lozenge has raised questions about the relative safety of the lozenge and gum.	[]
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the safety profiles of the 4 - mg nicotine lozenge and 4 - mg nicotine gum in smokers with selected label - restricted diseases.	[]
METHODS: This was a multicenter, randomized, open - label study in adult smokers with heart disease, hypertension not controlled by medication, and / or diabetes mellitus.

Patients were randomized in a 1: 1 ratio to receive the 4 - mg nicotine lozenge or 4 - mg nicotine gum.	[]
Safety assessments were made at baseline and at 2, 4, 6, and 12 weeks after the start of product use.	[]
RESULTS: Nine hundred one patients were randomized to treatment, 447 who received the lozenge and 454 who received the gum ( safety population).	[]
The majority were women ( 52. 7%).	[]
Patients ' mean age was 53. 9 years, their mean weight was 193. 9 pounds, and they smoked a mean of 25. 2 cigarettes per day at baseline.	[]
Five hundred fifty - three patients, 264 taking the lozenge and 289 taking the gum, used the study product for > or = 4 days per week during the first 2 weeks ( evaluable population).	[]
The nicotine lozenge and nicotine gum were equally well tolerated, despite increased nicotine exposure from the lozenge.	[]
The incidence of adverse events in the 2 groups was similar during the first 2 weeks of product use ( evaluation population: 55. 3% lozenge, 54. 7% gum), as well as during the entire study ( safety population: 63. 8% and 58. 6%, respectively).	[]
Stratification of patients by sex, age, extent of concurrent smoking, extent of product use, and severity of adverse events revealed no clinically significant differences between the lozenge and gum.	[]
The most common adverse events were nausea ( 17. 2% and 16. 1%; 95% CI, - 3. 7 to 6. 0), hiccups ( 10. 7% and 6. 6%; 95% CI, 0. 5 to 7. 8), and headache ( 8. 7% and 9. 9%; 95% Cl, - 5. 0 to 2. 6).

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI) in normal volunteers, we studied the gabapentin - induced modulation of brain activity in response to nociceptive mechanical stimulation of normal skin and capsaicin - induced secondary hyperalgesia.

The dose of gabapentin was 1, 800 mg per os, in a single administration.	[]
We found that ( i) gabapentin reduced the activations in the bilateral operculoinsular cortex, independently of the presence of central sensitization; ( ii) gabapentin reduced the activation in the brainstem, only during central sensitization; ( iii) gabapentin suppressed stimulus - induced deactivations, only during central sensitization; this effect was more robust than the effect on brain activation.	[]
The observed drug - induced effects were not due to changes in the baseline fMRI signal.	[]
These findings indicate that gabapentin has a measurable antinociceptive effect and a stronger antihyperalgesic effect most evident in the brain areas undergoing deactivation, thus supporting the concept that gabapentin is more effective in modulating nociceptive transmission when central sensitization is present.

Increased production of FRs may cause mtDNA damage leading to decreased activities of oxidative phosphorylation complexes containing mtDNA - encoded subunits.	[]
In this study, we investigated whether increased generation of FR during status epilepticus would be sufficient to provoke abnormalities in mtDNA and in the expression and activity of cytochrome c oxidase ( CCO), complex IV of the respiratory chain, in the chronic phase of the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy.

DNA analysis revealed low amounts of a 4. 8 kb mtDNA deletion but with no differences in frequency or quantity in the control and experimental groups.	[]

No abnormality in CCO activity was observed through histochemistry.	[]
Although evidences of mitochondrial abnormalities were found in previously published studies, our results do not suggest that the FRs, generated during the acute phase, determined important abnormalities in mtDNA, in expression of CCO - I, and in CCO activity.

Compared with MDMA - free polydrug controls, MDMA polydrug users showed impairments in set shifting and memory updating, and also in social and emotional judgement processes.	[]
The latter two deficits remained significant after controlling for other drug use.	[]
These data lend further support to the proposal that cognitive processes mediated by the prefrontal cortex may be impaired by recreational ecstasy use.	[]

Pharmacokinetics of desipramine HCl when administered with cinacalcet HCl.	[]
OBJECTIVE: In vitro work has demonstrated that cinacalcet is a strong inhibitor of cytochrome P450 isoenzyme ( CYP) 2D6.	[]
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of cinacalcet on CYP2D6 activity, using desipramine as a probe substrate, in healthy subjects.	[]
METHODS: Seventeen subjects who were genotyped as CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers were enrolled in this randomized, open - label, crossover study to receive a single oral dose of desipramine ( 50 mg) on two separate occasions, once alone and once after multiple doses of cinacalcet ( 90 mg for 7 days).	[]
Blood samples were obtained predose and up to 72 h postdose.	[]
RESULTS: Fourteen subjects completed both treatment arms.	[]
Relative to desipramine alone, mean AUC and C ( max) of desipramine increased 3. 6 - and 1. 8 - fold when coadministered with cinacalcet.	[]
The t ( 1 / 2, z) of desipramine was longer when desipramine was coadministered with cinacalcet ( 21. 0 versus 43. 3 hs).	[]
The t ( max) was similar between the regimens.	[]
Fewer subjects reported adverse events following treatment with desipramine alone than when receiving desipramine with cinacalcet ( 33 versus 86%), the most frequent of which ( nausea and headache) have been reported for patients treated with either desipramine or cinacalcet.

The present study was aimed at investigating the effects of Daucus carota seeds on cognitive functions, total serum cholesterol levels and brain cholinesterase activity in mice.	[]
The ethanolic extract of Daucus carota seeds ( DCE) was administered orally in three doses ( 100, 200, 400 mg / kg) for seven successive days to different groups of young and aged mice.	[]
Elevated plus maze and passive avoidance apparatus served as the exteroceptive behavioral models for testing memory.	[]
Diazepam -, scopolamine - and ageing - induced amnesia served as the interoceptive behavioral models.	"amnesia	47	54	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""amnesia"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
DCE ( 200, 400 mg / kg, p. o.) showed significant improvement in memory scores of young and aged mice.	[]
The extent of memory improvement evoked by DCE was 23% at the dose of 200 mg / kg and 35% at the dose of 400 mg / kg in young mice using elevated plus maze.	[]
Similarly, significant improvements in memory scores were observed using passive avoidance apparatus and aged mice.	[]
Furthermore, DCE reversed the amnesia induced by scopolamine ( 0. 4 mg / kg, i. p.) and diazepam ( 1 mg / kg, i. p.).	"amnesia	30	37	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""amnesia"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Daucus carota extract ( 200, 400 mg / kg, p. o.) reduced significantly the brain acetylcholinesterase activity and cholesterol levels in young and aged mice.	[]
The extent of inhibition of brain cholinesterase activity evoked by DCE at the dose of 400 mg / kg was 22% in young and 19% in aged mice.	[]
There was a remarkable reduction in total cholesterol level as well, to the extent of 23% in young and 21% in aged animals with this dose of DCE.	[]
Therefore, DCE may prove to be a useful remedy for the management of cognitive dysfunctions on account of its multifarious beneficial effects such as, memory improving property, cholesterol lowering property and anticholinesterase activity.

Hormone therapy users were compared with never users.	[]
RESULTS: Intramuscular hormone therapy use for 1 year or longer was reported by 25 women.	[]
In almost half of these women severe atherosclerosis of the aorta was present ( n = 11), while in women without hormone use severe atherosclerosis of the aorta was present in less than 20% ( OR 3. 1; 95% CI, 1. 1 - 8. 5, adjusted for age, years since menopause, smoking, and body mass index).

Male SD rats ( n = 30) were treated with Ato ( 50 mg / kg per day in drinking water) or tap water for 15 days.	[]
Dexamethasone ( 10 microg / kg per day, s. c.) or saline was started after 4 days in Ato - treated and non - treated rats and continued for 11 - 13 days.	[]
Systolic blood pressure ( SBP) was measured on alternate days using the tail - cuff method.	[]
Endothelial function was assessed by acetylcholine - induced vasorelaxation and phenylephrine - induced vasoconstriction in aortic segments.	[]
Vascular eNOS mRNA was assessed by semi - quantitative reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction.	[]

It has also been suggested that sirolimus directly causes increased glomerular permeability / injury, but evidence for this mechanism is currently inconclusive.	[]
The acute renal dysfunction associated with sirolimus ( such as in delayed graft function) may be due to suppression of compensatory renal cell proliferation and survival / repair processes.

Although these adverse effects occur in some patients, their occurrence could be minimised by knowledge of the molecular effects of sirolimus on the kidney, the use of sirolimus in appropriate patient populations, close monitoring of proteinuria and renal function, use of angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers if proteinuria occurs and withdrawal if needed.

Responses of urinary strip preparations from control and cyclophosphamide - pretreated rats to electrical field stimulation and to agonists were assessed in the absence and presence of muscarinic, adrenergic and purinergic receptor antagonists.	[]
Generally, atropine reduced contractions, but in contrast to controls, it also reduced responses to low electrical field stimulation intensity ( 1 - 5 Hz) in inflamed preparations.	[]
In both types, purinoceptor desensitization with alpha, beta - methylene adenosine - 5 ' - triphosphate ( alpha, beta - meATP) caused further reductions at low frequencies ( < 10 Hz).	[]
The muscarinic receptor antagonists atropine, 4 - diphenylacetoxy - N - methylpiperidine ( 4 - DAMP) ( ' M ( 1) / M ( 3) / M ( 5) - selective '), methoctramine ( ' M ( 2) - selective ') and pirenzepine ( ' M ( 1) - selective ') antagonized the tonic component of the electrical field stimulation - evoked contractile response more potently than the phasic component.	[]
4 - DAMP inhibited the tonic contractions in controls more potently than methoctramine and pirenzepine.	[]
In inflamed preparations, the muscarinic receptor antagonism on the phasic component of the electrical field stimulation - evoked contraction was decreased and the pirenzepine and 4 - DAMP antagonism on the tonic component was much less efficient than in controls.	[]
In contrast to controls, methoctramine increased - - instead of decreased - - the tonic responses at high frequencies.	[]
While contractions to carbachol and ATP were the same in inflamed and in control strips when related to a reference potassium response, isoprenaline - induced relaxations were smaller in inflamed strips.	[]

Activation of presynaptic alpha2 - adrenoceptors is the most widely accepted mechanism of action of the antisympathetic drug clonidine; however, other target proteins have been postulated to contribute to the in vivo actions of clonidine.	[]
METHODS AND RESULTS: To test whether clonidine elicits pharmacological effects independent of alpha2 - adrenoceptors, we have generated mice with a targeted deletion of all 3 alpha2 - adrenoceptor subtypes ( alpha2ABC - / -).	[]
Alpha2ABC - / - mice were completely unresponsive to the analgesic and hypnotic effects of clonidine; however, clonidine significantly lowered heart rate in alpha2ABC - / - mice by up to 150 bpm.	[]
Clonidine - induced bradycardia in conscious alpha2ABC - / - mice was 32. 3% ( 10 microg / kg) and 26. 6% ( 100 microg / kg) of the effect in wild - type mice.	"bradycardia	20	31	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""bradycardia"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
A similar bradycardic effect of clonidine was observed in isolated spontaneously beating right atria from alpha2ABC - knockout and wild - type mice.	[]
Clonidine inhibited the native pacemaker current ( I ( f)) in isolated sinoatrial node pacemaker cells and the I ( f) - generating hyperpolarization - activated cyclic nucleotide - gated ( HCN) 2 and HCN4 channels in transfected HEK293 cells.	[]
As a consequence of blocking I ( f), clonidine reduced the slope of the diastolic depolarization and the frequency of pacemaker potentials in sinoatrial node cells from wild - type and alpha2ABC - knockout mice.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: Direct inhibition of cardiac HCN pacemaker channels contributes to the bradycardic effects of clonidine gene - targeted mice in vivo, and thus, clonidine - like drugs represent novel structures for future HCN channel inhibitors.	[]

Influence of smoking on developing cochlea.	[]
Does smoking during pregnancy affect the amplitudes of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions in newborns?	[]
OBJECTIVE: Maternal tobacco smoking has negative effects on fetal growth.	[]
The influence of smoking during pregnancy on the developing cochlea has not been estimated, although smoking has been positively associated with hearing loss in adults.

The objective of this study was to determine the effects of maternal smoking on transient evoked otoacoustic emissions ( TEOAEs) of healthy neonates.	[]
METHODS: This study was undertaken as part of neonatal screening for hearing impairment and involved both ears of 200 newborns.	"hearing impairment	69	87	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hearing impairment"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Newborns whose mothers reported smoking during pregnancy ( n = 200 ears) were compared to a control group of newborns ( n = 200 ears), whose mothers were non - smokers.	[]
Exposure to tobacco was characterized as low ( < 5 cigarettes per day, n = 88 ears), moderate ( 5 < or = cigarettes per day < 10, n = 76) or high ( > or = 10 cigarettes per day, n = 36).	[]
RESULTS: In exposed neonates, TEOAEs mean response ( across frequency) and mean amplitude at 4000Hz was significantly lower than in non - exposed neonates.	[]
Comparisons between exposed newborns ' subgroups revealed no significant differences.	[]
However, by comparing each subgroup to control group, we found statistically significant decreases of TEOAEs amplitudes at 4000Hz for all three groups.	"decreases of TEOAEs amplitudes	89	119	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""decreases of TEOAEs amplitudes"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Mean TEOAEs responses of highly exposed newborns were also significantly lower in comparison to our control group.	[]
CONCLUSION: In utero, exposure to tobacco smoking seems to have a small impact on outer hair cells.	[]
These effects seem to be equally true for all exposed newborns, regardless of the degree of exposure.	[]
Further studies are needed in order to establish a potential negative effect of maternal smoking on the neonate ' s hearing acuity.	[]

We studied the effects of terbutaline on microglial activation in different brain regions and behavioral outcomes in developing rats.	[]
Newborn rats were given terbutaline ( 10 mg / kg) daily on postnatal days ( PN) 2 to 5 or PN 11 to 14 and examined 24 h after the last dose and at PN 30.	[]
Immunohistochemical studies showed that administration of terbutaline on PN 2 to 5 produced a robust increase in microglial activation on PN 30 in the cerebral cortex, as well as in cerebellar and cerebrocortical white matter.	[]
None of these effects occurred in animals given terbutaline on PN 11 to 14.	[]
In behavioral tests, animals treated with terbutaline on PN 2 to 5 showed consistent patterns of hyper - reactivity to novelty and aversive stimuli when assessed in a novel open field, as well as in the acoustic startle response test.	[]
Our findings indicate that beta2 - adrenoceptor overstimulation during an early critical period results in microglial activation associated with innate neuroinflammatory pathways and behavioral abnormalities, similar to those described in autism.

Upregulation of brain expression of P - glycoprotein in MRP2 - deficient TR ( -) rats resembles seizure - induced up - regulation of this drug efflux transporter in normal rats.

PURPOSE: The multidrug resistance protein 2 ( MRP2) is a drug efflux transporter that is expressed predominantly at the apical domain of hepatocytes but seems also to be expressed at the apical membrane of brain capillary endothelial cells that form the blood - brain barrier ( BBB).	[]
MRP2 is absent in the transport - deficient ( TR ( -)) Wistar rat mutant, so that this rat strain was very helpful in defining substrates of MRP2 by comparing tissue concentrations or functional activities of compounds in MRP2 - deficient rats with those in transport - competent Wistar rats.	[]
By using this strategy to study the involvement of MRP2 in brain access of antiepileptic drugs ( AEDs), we recently reported that phenytoin is a substrate for MRP2 in the BBB.	[]
However, one drawback of such studies in genetically deficient rats is the fact that compensatory changes with upregulation of other transporters can occur.	[]
This prompted us to study the brain expression of P - glycoprotein ( Pgp), a major drug efflux transporter in many tissues, including the BBB, in TR ( -) rats compared with nonmutant ( wild - type) Wistar rats.	[]
METHODS: The expression of MRP2 and Pgp in brain and liver sections of TR ( -) rats and normal Wistar rats was determined with immunohistochemistry, by using a novel, highly selective monoclonal MRP2 antibody and the monoclonal Pgp antibody C219, respectively.	[]
RESULTS: Immunofluorescence staining with the MRP2 antibody was found to label a high number of microvessels throughout the brain in normal Wistar rats, whereas such labeling was absent in TR ( -) rats.	[]
TR ( -) rats exhibited a significant up - regulation of Pgp in brain capillary endothelial cells compared with wild - type controls.	[]
No such obvious upregulation of Pgp was observed in liver sections.	[]
A comparable overexpression of Pgp in the BBB was obtained after pilocarpine - induced seizures in wild - type Wistar rats.	"seizures	87	95	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""seizures"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Experiments with systemic administration of the Pgp substrate phenobarbital and the selective Pgp inhibitor tariquidar in TR ( -) rats substantiated that Pgp is functional and compensates for the lack of MRP2 in the BBB.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: The data on TR ( -) rats indicate that Pgp plays an important role in the compensation of MRP2 deficiency in the BBB.	[]
Because such a compensatory mechanism most likely occurs to reduce injury to the brain from cytotoxic compounds, the present data substantiate the concept that MRP2 performs a protective role in the BBB.	"injury to the brain	67	86	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""injury to the brain"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Furthermore, our data suggest that TR ( -) rats are an interesting tool to study consequences of overexpression of Pgp in the BBB on access of drugs in the brain, without the need of inducing seizures or other Pgp - enhancing events for this purpose.

Assessment of a new non - invasive index of cardiac performance for detection of dobutamine - induced myocardial ischemia.	"myocardial ischemia	102	121	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""myocardial ischemia"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
BACKGROUND: Electrocardiography has a very low sensitivity in detecting dobutamine - induced myocardial ischemia.	"myocardial ischemia	93	112	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""myocardial ischemia"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
OBJECTIVES: To assess the added diagnostic value of a new cardiac performance index ( dP / dtejc) measurement, based on brachial artery flow changes, as compared to standard 12 - lead ECG, for detecting dobutamine - induced myocardial ischemia, using Tc99m - Sestamibi single - photon emission computed tomography as the gold standard of comparison to assess the presence or absence of ischemia.

METHODS: The study group comprised 40 patients undergoing Sestamibi - SPECT / dobutamine stress test.	[]
Simultaneous measurements of ECG and brachial artery dP / dtejc were performed at each dobutamine level.	[]
In 19 of the 40 patients perfusion defects compatible with ischemia were detected on SPECT.	"ischemia	59	67	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ischemia"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The increase in dP / dtejc during infusion of dobutamine in this group was severely impaired as compared to the non - ischemic group.	[]
dP / dtejc outcome was combined with the ECG results, giving an ECG - enhanced value, and compared to ECG alone.	[]
RESULTS: The sensitivity improved dramatically from 16% to 79%, positive predictive value increased from 60% to 68% and negative predictive value from 54% to 78%, and specificity decreased from 90% to 67%.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: If ECG alone is used for specificity, the combination with dP / dtejc improved the sensitivity of the test and could be a cost - savings alternative to cardiac imaging or perfusion studies to detect myocardial ischemia, especially in patients unable to exercise.

BACKGROUND: No direct comparisons exist of the renal tolerability of the low - osmolality contrast medium iopamidol with that of the iso - osmolality contrast medium iodixanol in high - risk patients.	[]
METHODS AND RESULTS: The present study is a multicenter, randomized, double - blind comparison of iopamidol and iodixanol in patients with chronic kidney disease ( estimated glomerular filtration rate, 20 to 59 mL / min) who underwent cardiac angiography or percutaneous coronary interventions.

Serum creatinine ( SCr) levels and estimated glomerular filtration rate were assessed at baseline and 2 to 5 days after receiving medications.	[]
The primary outcome was a postdose SCr increase > or = 0. 5 mg / dL ( 44. 2 micromol / L) over baseline.	[]
Secondary outcomes were a postdose SCr increase > or = 25%, a postdose estimated glomerular filtration rate decrease of > or = 25%, and the mean peak change in SCr.	[]
In 414 patients, contrast volume, presence of diabetes mellitus, use of N - acetylcysteine, mean baseline SCr, and estimated glomerular filtration rate were comparable in the 2 groups.

To develop a novel and effective drug that could enhance cognitive function and neuroprotection, we newly synthesized maltolyl p - coumarate by the esterification of maltol and p - coumaric acid.	[]
In the present study, we investigated whether maltolyl p - coumarate could improve cognitive decline in scopolamine - injected rats and in amyloid beta peptide ( 1 - 42) - infused rats.

We also examined the neuroprotective effects of maltolyl p - coumarate in vitro using SH - SY5Y cells.	[]
Cells were pretreated with maltolyl p - coumarate, before exposed to amyloid beta peptide ( 1 - 42), glutamate or H2O2.	[]
We found that maltolyl p - coumarate significantly decreased apoptotic cell death and reduced reactive oxygen species, cytochrome c release, and caspase 3 activation.	[]

Such systemic lipopolysaccharide treatment mitigated methamphetamine - induced striatal dopamine and 3, 4 - dihydroxyphenylacetic acid depletions in a dose - dependent manner.	[]
As the most potent dose ( 1 mg / kg) of lipopolysaccharide was administered two weeks, one day before or after the methamphetamine dosing regimen, methamphetamine - induced striatal dopamine and 3, 4 - dihydroxyphenylacetic acid depletions remained unaltered.	[]
Moreover, systemic lipopolysaccharide pretreatment ( 1 mg / kg) attenuated local methamphetamine infusion - produced dopamine and 3, 4 - dihydroxyphenylacetic acid depletions in the striatum, indicating that the protective effect of lipopolysaccharide is less likely due to interrupted peripheral distribution or metabolism of methamphetamine.

DISCUSSION: The risk of rhabdomyolysis is increased in the presence of concomitant drugs that inhibit simvastatin metabolism.	"rhabdomyolysis	24	38	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""rhabdomyolysis"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Simvastatin is metabolized by CYP3A4.	[]
Amiodarone and atazanavir are recognized CYP3A4 inhibitors.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacokinetic differences in statins are an important consideration for assessing the risk of potential drug interactions.	[]
In patients requiring the concurrent use of statins and CYP3A4 inhibitors, pravastatin, fluvastatin, and rosuvastatin carry the lowest risk of drug interactions; atorvastatin carries moderate risk, whereas simvastatin and lovastatin have the highest risk and should be avoided in patients taking concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors.

It remains to be seen whether such pre - existing antiviral mutations could result in widespread emergence of HBV resistant strains when lamivudine - containing highly active antiretroviral ( ARV) treatment ( HAART) regimens become widely applied in South Africa, as this is likely to have potential implications in the management of HBV - HIV co - infected patients.

Estrogen prevents cholesteryl ester accumulation in macrophages induced by the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir.	[]
Individuals with HIV can now live long lives with drug therapy that often includes protease inhibitors such as ritonavir.	[]
Many patients, however, develop negative long - term side effects such as premature atherosclerosis.	"premature atherosclerosis	74	99	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""premature atherosclerosis"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Furthermore, peripheral blood monocytes isolated from ritonavir - treated females had less cholesteryl ester accumulation.	[]
In the present study, we have investigated the molecular mechanisms by which female hormones influence cholesterol metabolism in macrophages in response to the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir.	[]
We have utilized the human monocyte cell line, THP - 1 as a model to address this question.	[]
Briefly, cells were differentiated for 72 h with 100 nM PMA to obtain a macrophage - like phenotype in the presence or absence of 1 nM 17beta - estradiol ( E2), 100 nM progesterone or vehicle ( 0. 01% ethanol).	[]
Cells were then treated with 30 ng / ml ritonavir or vehicle in the presence of aggregated LDL for 24 h.	[]
Cell extracts were harvested, and lipid or total RNA was isolated.	[]
E2 decreased the accumulation of cholesteryl esters in macrophages following ritonavir treatment.	[]
Ritonavir increased the expression of the scavenger receptor, CD36 mRNA, responsible for the uptake of LDL.	[]
Additionally, ritonavir treatment selectively increased the relative levels of PPARgamma mRNA, a transcription factor responsible for the regulation of CD36 mRNA expression.	[]
Treatment with E2, however, failed to prevent these increases at the mRNA level.	[]
E2 did, however, significantly suppress CD36 protein levels as measured by fluorescent immunocytochemistry.	[]
This data suggests that E2 modifies the expression of CD36 at the level of protein expression in monocyte - derived macrophages resulting in reduced cholesteryl ester accumulation following ritonavir treatment.	[]

Associations between use of benzodiazepines or related drugs and health, physical abilities and cognitive function: a non - randomised clinical study in the elderly.	[]
OBJECTIVE: To describe associations between the use of benzodiazepines or related drugs ( BZDs / RDs) and health, functional abilities and cognitive function in the elderly.	[]
METHODS: A non - randomised clinical study of patients aged > or = 65 years admitted to acute hospital wards during 1 month.	[]
164 patients ( mean age + / - standard deviation [ SD] 81. 6 + / - 6. 8 years) were admitted.	[]
Of these, nearly half ( n = 78) had used BZDs / RDs before admission, and the remainder ( n = 86) were non - users.	[]
Cognitive ability was assessed by the Mini - Mental State Examination ( MMSE).	[]
Patients scoring > or = 20 MMSE sum points were interviewed ( n = 79) and questioned regarding symptoms and functional abilities during the week prior to admission.	[]
Data on use of BZDs / RDs before admission, current medications and discharge diagnoses were collected from medical records.	[]
Health, physical abilities and cognitive function were compared between BZD / RD users and non - users, and adjustments were made for confounding variables.	[]
The residual serum concentrations of oxazepam, temazepam and zopiclone were analysed.	[]
RESULTS: The mean + / - SD duration of BZD / RD use was 7 + / - 7 years ( range 1 - 31).	[]
Two or three BZDs / RDs were concomitantly taken by 26% of users ( n = 20).	[]
Long - term use of these drugs was associated with female sex and use of a higher number of drugs with effects on the CNS, which tended to be related to diagnosed dementia.	"dementia	163	171	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""dementia"", ""start_span"": 163, ""end_span"": 171, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
After adjustment for these variables as confounders, use of BZDs / RDs was not associated with cognitive function as measured by the MMSE.	[]
However, use of BZDs / RDs was associated with dizziness, inability to sleep after awaking at night and tiredness in the mornings during the week prior to admission and with stronger depressive symptoms measured at the beginning of the hospital stay.	"dizziness	47	56	Disease/Disorder"	"inability to sleep	58	76	Disease/Disorder"	"tiredness	104	113	Disease/Disorder"	"depressive symptoms	183	202	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""dizziness"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""inability to sleep"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""tiredness"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""depressive symptoms"", ""start_span"": 183, ""end_span"": 202, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Use of BZDs / RDs tended to be associated with a reduced ability to walk and shorter night - time sleep during the week prior to admission.	[]
A higher residual serum concentration of temazepam correlated with a lower MMSE sum score after adjustment for confounding variables.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: Long - term use and concomitant use of more than one BZD / RD were common in elderly patients hospitalised because of acute illnesses.	[]
Long - term use was associated with daytime and night - time symptoms indicative of poorer health and potentially caused by the adverse effects of these drugs.	[]

Norepinephrine signaling through beta - adrenergic receptors is critical for expression of cocaine - induced anxiety.	"anxiety	109	116	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""anxiety"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
BACKGROUND: Cocaine is a widely abused psychostimulant that has both rewarding and aversive properties.	[]
While the mechanisms underlying cocaine ' s rewarding effects have been studied extensively, less attention has been paid to the unpleasant behavioral states induced by cocaine, such as anxiety.	"anxiety	186	193	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""anxiety"", ""start_span"": 186, ""end_span"": 193, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the performance of dopamine beta - hydroxylase knockout ( Dbh - / -) mice, which lack norepinephrine ( NE), in the elevated plus maze ( EPM) to examine the contribution of noradrenergic signaling to cocaine - induced anxiety.	"anxiety	254	261	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""anxiety"", ""start_span"": 254, ""end_span"": 261, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
RESULTS: We found that cocaine dose - dependently increased anxiety - like behavior in control ( Dbh + / -) mice, as measured by a decrease in open arm exploration.	"anxiety	60	67	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""anxiety"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The Dbh - / - mice had normal baseline performance in the EPM but were completely resistant to the anxiogenic effects of cocaine.	[]
Cocaine - induced anxiety was also attenuated in Dbh + / - mice following administration of disulfiram, a dopamine beta - hydroxylase ( DBH) inhibitor.	"anxiety	18	25	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""anxiety"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In experiments using specific adrenergic antagonists, we found that pretreatment with the beta - adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol blocked cocaine - induced anxiety - like behavior in Dbh + / - and wild - type C57BL6 / J mice, while the alpha ( 1) antagonist prazosin and the alpha ( 2) antagonist yohimbine had no effect.	"anxiety	166	173	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""anxiety"", ""start_span"": 166, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Hypothalamic prolactin receptor messenger ribonucleic acid levels, prolactin signaling, and hyperprolactinemic inhibition of pulsatile luteinizing hormone secretion are dependent on estradiol.

Although central prolactin actions are thought to contribute to this, the mechanisms are poorly understood.	[]
We first tested whether chronic hyperprolactinemia inhibited two neuroendocrine parameters necessary for female fertility: pulsatile LH secretion and the estrogen - induced LH surge.	"hyperprolactinemia	32	50	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hyperprolactinemia"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Chronic hyperprolactinemia induced by the dopamine antagonist sulpiride caused a 40% reduction LH pulse frequency in ovariectomized rats, but only in the presence of chronic low levels of estradiol.	"hyperprolactinemia	8	26	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hyperprolactinemia"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Sulpiride did not affect the magnitude of a steroid - induced LH surge or the percentage of GnRH neurons activated during the surge.	[]
Estradiol is known to influence expression of the long form of prolactin receptors ( PRL - R) and components of prolactin ' s signaling pathway.	[]
To test the hypothesis that estrogen increases PRL - R expression and sensitivity to prolactin, we next demonstrated that estradiol greatly augments prolactin - induced STAT5 activation.	[]
Lastly, we measured PRL - R and suppressor of cytokine signaling ( SOCS - 1 and - 3 and CIS, which reflect the level of prolactin signaling) mRNAs in response to sulpiride and estradiol.	[]
Sulpiride induced only SOCS - 1 in the medial preoptic area, where GnRH neurons are regulated, but in the arcuate nucleus and choroid plexus, PRL - R, SOCS - 3, and CIS mRNA levels were also induced.	[]
Estradiol enhanced these effects on SOCS - 3 and CIS.	[]
Interestingly, estradiol also induced PRL - R, SOCS - 3, and CIS mRNA levels independently.	[]
These data show that GnRH pulse frequency is inhibited by chronic hyperprolactinemia in a steroid - dependent manner.	"hyperprolactinemia	66	84	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hyperprolactinemia"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Doses were flexibly titrated up to 0. 6 mg / day for clonidine and 60 mg / day for methylphenidate ( both with divided dosing).	[]
Groups were compared regarding adverse events and changes from baseline to week 16 in electrocardiograms and vital signs.	[]
RESULTS: There were more incidents of bradycardia in subjects treated with clonidine compared with those not treated with clonidine ( 17. 5% versus 3. 4%; p =. 02), but no other significant group differences regarding electrocardiogram and other cardiovascular outcomes.

The novel immunosuppressive ( IS) drug sirolmus ( Srl) lacks nephrotoxic effects; however, proteinuria associated with Srl has been reported following renal transplantation.

In this study, long - term cardiac transplant patients were switched from cyclosporine to Srl - based IS.	[]
Concomitant IS consisted of mycophenolate mofetil + / - steroids.	[]
Proteinuria increased significantly from a median of 0. 13 g / day ( range 0 - 5. 7) preswitch to 0. 23 g / day ( 0 - 9. 88) at 24 months postswitch ( p = 0. 0024).	[]
Before the switch, 11. 5% of patients had high - grade proteinuria ( > 1. 0 g / day); this increased to 22. 9% postswitch ( p = 0. 006).	"proteinuria	55	66	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""proteinuria"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Ginsenoside Rg1 restores the impairment of learning induced by chronic morphine administration in rats.	"impairment of learning	29	51	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""impairment of learning"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Rg1, as a ginsenoside extracted from Panax ginseng, could ameliorate spatial learning impairment.	"learning impairment	77	96	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""learning impairment"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Previous studies have demonstrated that Rg1 might be a useful agent for the prevention and treatment of the adverse effects of morphine.	[]
The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Rg1 on learning impairment by chronic morphine administration and the mechanism responsible for this effect.	"learning impairment	62	81	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""learning impairment"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Male rats were subcutaneously injected with morphine ( 10 mg / kg) twice a day at 12 hour intervals for 10 days, and Rg1 ( 30 mg / kg) was intraperitoneally injected 2 hours after the second injection of morphine once a day for 10 days.	[]
Spatial learning capacity was assessed in the Morris water maze.	[]
The results showed that rats treated with Morphine / Rg1 decreased escape latency and increased the time spent in platform quadrant and entering frequency.	[]
By implantation of electrodes and electrophysiological recording in vivo, the results showed that Rg1 restored the long - term potentiation ( LTP) impaired by morphine in both freely moving and anaesthetised rats.	[]
The electrophysiological recording in vitro showed that Rg1 restored the LTP in slices from the rats treated with morphine, but not changed LTP in the slices from normal saline - or morphine / Rg1 - treated rats; this restoration could be inhibited by N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA) receptor antagonist MK801.	[]
We conclude that Rg1 may significantly improve the spatial learning capacity impaired by chonic morphine administration and restore the morphine - inhibited LTP.	[]
This effect is NMDA receptor dependent.	[]

Evidence for an involvement of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors in mediating nicotine - induced hyperactivity in rats.	"hyperactivity	92	105	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hyperactivity"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Previous studies have suggested that repeated exposure of rats to the drug or to the experimental environment is necessary to observe nicotine - induced locomotor stimulation.	[]
In the present study the role of habituation to the experimental environment on the stimulant effect of nicotine in rats was examined.	[]
In addition, the role of dopamine receptors in mediating nicotine - induced locomotor stimulation was investigated by examining the effects of selective D1 and D2 dopamine receptor antagonists on activity induced by nicotine.	[]
Locomotor activity was assessed in male Sprague - Dawley rats tested in photocell cages.	[]
Nicotine ( 1. 0 mg / kg) caused a significant increase in locomotor activity in rats that were habituated to the test environment, but had only a weak and delayed stimulant action in rats that were unfamiliar with the test environment.

The stimulant action of nicotine was blocked by the central nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine but not by the peripheral nicotinic blocker hexamethonium, indicating that the response is probably mediated by central nicotinic receptors.	[]
Nicotine - induced hyperactivity was blocked by the selective D1 antagonist SCH 23390, the selective D2 antagonist raclopride and the D1 / D2 antagonist fluphenazine.

The bronchodilator effects of a single dose of ipratropium bromide aerosol ( 36 micrograms) and short - acting theophylline tablets ( dose titrated to produce serum levels of 10 - 20 micrograms / mL) were compared in a double - blind, placebo - controlled crossover study in 21 patients with stable, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.	"chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	300	337	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""chronic obstructive pulmonary disease"", ""start_span"": 300, ""end_span"": 337, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Mean peak forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV1) increases over baseline and the proportion of patients attaining at least a 15% increase in the FEV1 ( responders) were 31% and 90%, respectively, for ipratropium and 17% and 50%, respectively, for theophylline.	[]
The average FEV1 increases during the 6 - hour observation period were 18% for ipratropium and 8% for theophylline.	[]
The mean duration of action was 3. 8 hours with ipratropium and 2. 4 hours with theophylline.	[]

Methamphetamine - induced neurotoxicity and microglial activation are not mediated by fractalkine receptor signaling.	"neurotoxicity	26	39	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""neurotoxicity"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Methamphetamine ( METH) damages dopamine ( DA) nerve endings by a process that has been linked to microglial activation but the signaling pathways that mediate this response have not yet been delineated.	[]
Cardona et al.	[]
[ Nat. Neurosci. 9 ( 2006), 917] recently identified the microglial - specific fractalkine receptor ( CX3CR1) as an important mediator of MPTP - induced neurodegeneration of DA neurons.	"neurodegeneration	153	170	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""neurodegeneration"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 170, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Because the CNS damage caused by METH and MPTP is highly selective for the DA neuronal system in mouse models of neurotoxicity, we hypothesized that the CX3CR1 plays a role in METH - induced neurotoxicity and microglial activation.	"CNS damage	12	22	Disease/Disorder"	"neurotoxicity	113	126	Disease/Disorder"	"neurotoxicity	113	126	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""CNS damage"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""neurotoxicity"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""neurotoxicity"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Mice in which the CX3CR1 gene has been deleted and replaced with a cDNA encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein ( eGFP) were treated with METH and examined for striatal neurotoxicity.	"neurotoxicity	173	186	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""neurotoxicity"", ""start_span"": 173, ""end_span"": 186, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
METH depleted DA, caused microglial activation, and increased body temperature in CX3CR1 knockout mice to the same extent and over the same time course seen in wild - type controls.	[]
The effects of METH in CX3CR1 knockout mice were not gender - dependent and did not extend beyond the striatum.	[]
Striatal microglia expressing eGFP constitutively show morphological changes after METH that are characteristic of activation.	[]
This response was restricted to the striatum and contrasted sharply with unresponsive eGFP - microglia in surrounding brain areas that are not damaged by METH.	[]
We conclude from these studies that CX3CR1 signaling does not modulate METH neurotoxicity or microglial activation.	"neurotoxicity	76	89	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""neurotoxicity"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Furthermore, it appears that striatal - resident microglia respond to METH with an activation cascade and then return to a surveying state without undergoing apoptosis or migration.	[]

Acute effects of N - ( 2 - propylpentanoyl) urea on hippocampal amino acid neurotransmitters in pilocarpine - induced seizure in rats.	"seizure	118	125	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""seizure"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The present study aimed to investigate the anticonvulsant activity as well as the effects on the level of hippocampal amino acid neurotransmitters ( glutamate, aspartate, glycine and GABA) of N - ( 2 - propylpentanoyl) urea ( VPU) in comparison to its parent compound, valproic acid ( VPA).	[]
VPU was more potent than VPA, exhibiting the median effective dose ( ED ( 50)) of 49 mg / kg in protecting rats against pilocarpine - induced seizure whereas the corresponding value for VPA was 322 mg / kg.	"seizure	142	149	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""seizure"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In vivo microdialysis demonstrated that an intraperitoneal administration of pilocarpine induced a pronounced increment of hippocampal glutamate and aspartate whereas no significant change was observed on the level of glycine and GABA.	[]
Pretreatment with either VPU ( 50 and 100 mg / kg) or VPA ( 300 and 600 mg / kg) completely abolished pilocarpine - evoked increases in extracellular glutamate and aspartate.	[]
In addition, a statistically significant reduction was also observed on the level of GABA and glycine but less than a drastic reduction of glutamate and aspartate level.	[]
Based on the finding that VPU and VPA could protect the animals against pilocarpine - induced seizure it is suggested that the reduction of inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitters was comparatively minor and offset by a pronounced reduction of glutamate and aspartate.	"seizure	94	101	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""seizure"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Therefore, like VPA, the finding that VPU could drastically reduce pilocarpine - induced increases in glutamate and aspartate should account, at least partly, for its anticonvulsant activity observed in pilocarpine - induced seizure in experimental animals.

Two groups were compared in this study.	[]
The prophylactic lamivudin group consisted of 37 patients who received prophylactic lamivudine treatment.	[]
The historical controls consisted of 50 consecutive patients who underwent CT without prophylactic lamivudine.	[]
They were followed up during and for 8 weeks after CT.	[]
The outcomes were compared for both groups.	[]
Of our control group ( n = 50), 21 patients ( 42%) were established hepatitis.	"hepatitis	68	77	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hepatitis"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Fentanyl is a commonly used supplement that may contribute to this, although it may also improve analgesia.	[]
METHODS: This double - blind study examined the incidence and severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting and pain in the first 24 h after sevoflurane anaesthesia in 216 adult day surgery patients.

Patients were randomly allocated to either receive or not receive 1 1 fentanyl, while a third group received dexamethasone in addition to fentanyl.	[]
RESULTS: Omission of fentanyl did not reduce the overall incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, but did reduce the incidence of vomiting and / or moderate to severe nausea prior to discharge from 20% and 17% with fentanyl and fentanyl - dexamethasone, respectively, to 5% ( P = 0. 013).

Antiemetic requirements were reduced from 24% and 31% to 7% ( P = 0. 0012).	[]
Dexamethasone had no significant effect on the incidence or severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting.	"postoperative nausea and vomiting	72	105	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""postoperative nausea and vomiting"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Combining the two fentanyl groups revealed further significant benefits from the avoidance of opioids, reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting and nausea prior to discharge from 35% and 33% to 22% and 19% ( P = 0. 049 and P = 0. 035), respectively, while nausea in the first 24 h was decreased from 42% to 27% ( P = 0. 034).

Pain severity and analgesic requirements were unaffected by the omission of fentanyl.	"Pain	0	4	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Pain"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Fentanyl did reduce minor intraoperative movement but had no sevoflurane - sparing effect and increased respiratory depression, hypotension and bradycardia.

CONCLUSION: As fentanyl exacerbated postoperative nausea and vomiting without an improvement in postoperative pain and also had adverse cardiorespiratory effects, it appears to be an unnecessary and possibly detrimental supplement to sevoflurane in day surgery.

METHODS: All PD patients in the Amiens area treated with pergolide were invited to attend a cardiologic assessment including transthoracic echocardiography.	"PD	13	15	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""PD"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Thirty PD patients participated in the study.	"PD	7	9	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""PD"", ""start_span"": 7, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
A second echocardiography was performed ( median interval: 13 months) after pergolide withdrawal ( n = 10 patients).	[]

RESULTS: Compared to controls, aortic regurgitation ( OR: 3. 1; 95% IC: 1. 1 - 8. 8) and mitral regurgitation ( OR: 10. 7; 95% IC: 2. 1 - 53) were more frequent in PD patients ( tricuspid: NS).

The number of affected valves ( n = 2. 4 + / - 0. 7) and the sum of regurgitation grades ( n = 2. 8 + / - 1. 09) were higher ( p = 0. 008 and p = 0. 006, respectively) in the pergolide group.	[]
Severity of regurgitation was not correlated with pergolide cumulative dose.	[]
A restrictive pattern of valvular regurgitation, suggestive of the role of pergolide, was observed in 12 / 30 ( 40%) patients including two with heart failure.

BACKGROUND: The mechanisms underlying heart failure induced by adriamycin are very complicated and still unclear.	"heart failure	38	51	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""heart failure"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The aim of this study was to investigate whether autophagy was involved in the progression of heart failure induced by adriamycin, so that we can develop a novel treatment strategy for heart failure.

METHODS: 3 - methyladenine ( 3MA), a specific inhibitor on autophagy was used in a heart failure model of rats induced by adriamycin.	"heart failure	83	96	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""heart failure"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Neonatal cardiomyocytes were isolated from Sprague - Dawley rat hearts and randomly divided into controls, an adriamycin - treated group, and a 3MA plus adriamycin - treated group.	[]
We then examined the morphology, expression of beclin 1 gene, mitochondrial permeability transition ( MPT), and Na + - K + ATPase activity in vivo.	[]
We also assessed cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential changes and counted autophagic vacuoles in cultured cardiomyocytes.	[]
In addition, we analyzed the expression of autophagy associated gene, beclin 1 using RT - PCR and Western blotting in an animal model.	[]
RESULTS: 3MA significantly improved cardiac function and reduced mitochondrial injury.	[]
Furthermore, adriamycin induced the formation of autophagic vacuoles, and 3MA strongly downregulated the expression of beclin 1 in adriamycin - induced failing heart and inhibited the formation of autophagic vacuoles.	[]
CONCLUSION: Autophagic cardiomyocyte death plays an important role in the pathogenesis of heart failure in rats induced by adriamycin.

The timing of papaverine application and ongoing operative events was reviewed relative to changes in neurophysiological recordings.	[]
Brainstem auditory evoked potentials ( BAEPs) were routinely used to monitor cochlear nerve function during these operations.	[]
FINDINGS: A temporal relationship was found between topical papaverine and BAEP changes leading to complete waveform loss.	[]
The average temporal delay between papaverine and the onset of an adverse BAEP change was 5 min.	[]
In 10 of 11 patients, BAEP waves II / III - V completely disappeared within 2 to 25 min after papaverine.	[]
Eight of these 10 patients had complete loss of BAEP waveforms within 10 min.	[]
One patient showed no recovery of later waves and a delayed profound sensorineural hearing loss.	"sensorineural hearing loss	69	95	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""sensorineural hearing loss"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

The objective of this study was to report our experience concerning the effectiveness of the prophylactic administration of lamivudine in hepatitis B virus surface antigen ( HBs Ag) positive patients with rheumatologic disease.	"rheumatologic disease	205	226	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""rheumatologic disease"", ""start_span"": 205, ""end_span"": 226, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
From June 2004 to October 2006, 11 HBs Ag positive patients with rheumatologic diseases, who were on both immunosuppressive and prophylactic lamivudine therapies, were retrospectively assessed.

Eleven patients ( six male) with median age 47 years ( range 27 - 73), median disease duration 50 months ( range 9 - 178) and median follow - up period of patients 13. 8 months ( range 5 - 27) were enrolled in this study.	[]
Lamivudine therapy was started 3 - 7 days prior to immunosuppressive therapy in all patients.	[]
Baseline, liver function tests were elevated in two patients ( fourth patient: ALT: 122 IU / l, AST: 111 IU / l, tenth patient: ALT: 294 IU / l, AST: 274 IU / l, with minimal changes in the liver biopsy in both).	[]
Shortly after treatment their tests normalized and during follow - up period none of the patients had abnormal liver function tests.	"abnormal liver function	102	125	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""abnormal liver function"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In four patients HBV DNA levels were higher than normal at baseline.	[]
Two of these normalized and the others increased later.	[]
In three additional patients, HBV DNA levels were increased during follow - up.	[]
None of the patients had significant clinical sings of HBV activation.	[]
Lamivudine was well tolerated and was continued in all patients.	[]
Prophylactic administration of lamivudine in patients who required immunosuppressive therapy seems to be safe, well tolerated and effective in preventing HBV reactivation.	[]
Effect of green tea and vitamin E combination in isoproterenol induced myocardial infarction in rats.	"myocardial infarction	71	92	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""myocardial infarction"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The present study was aimed to investigate the combined effects of green tea and vitamin E on heart weight, body weight, serum marker enzymes, lipid peroxidation, endogenous antioxidants and membrane bound ATPases in isoproterenol ( ISO) - induced myocardial infarction in rats.	"myocardial infarction	248	269	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""myocardial infarction"", ""start_span"": 248, ""end_span"": 269, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Adult male albino rats, treated with ISO ( 200 mg / kg, s. c.) for 2 days at an interval of 24 h caused a significant ( P < 0. 05) elevation of heart weight, serum marker enzymes, lipid peroxidation and Ca + 2 ATPase level whereas there was a significant ( P < 0. 05) decrease in body weight, endogenous antioxidants, Na + / K + ATPase and Mg + 2 ATPase levels.	[]
Administration of green tea ( 100 mg / kg / day, p. o.) and vitamin E ( 100 mg / kg / day, p. o.) together for 30 consecutive days and challenged with ISO on the day 29th and 30th, showed a significant ( P < 0. 05) decrease in heart weight, serum marker enzymes, lipid peroxidation, Ca + 2 ATPase and a significant increase in the body weight, endogenous antioxidants, Na + / K + ATPase and Mg + 2 ATPase when compared with ISO treated group and green tea or vitamin E alone treated groups.

Renal papillary necrosis ( RPN) and a decreased urinary concentrating ability developed during continuous long - term treatment with aspirin and paracetamol in female Fischer 344 rats.

Renal structure and concentrating ability were examined after a recovery period of up to 18 weeks, when no analgesics were given, to investigate whether the analgesic - induced changes were reversible.	[]
There was no evidence of repair to the damaged medullary interstitial matrix, or proliferation of remaining undamaged type 1 medullary interstitial cells after the recovery period following analgesic treatment.	[]
The recovery of urinary concentrating ability was related to the length of analgesic treatment and the extent of the resulting inner medullary structural damage.	[]
During the early stages of analgesic treatment, the changes in urinary concentrating ability were reversible, but after prolonged analgesic treatment, maximum urinary concentrating ability failed to recover.	[]
This study shows that prolonged analgesic treatment in Fischer 344 rats causes progressive and irreversible damage to the interstitial matrix and type 1 interstitial cells leading to RPN.	"RPN	183	186	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""RPN"", ""start_span"": 183, ""end_span"": 186, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Testosterone - dependent hypertension and upregulation of intrarenal angiotensinogen in Dahl salt - sensitive rats.	"hypertension	25	37	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hypertension"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Blood pressure ( BP) is more salt sensitive in men than in premenopausal women.	[]
In Dahl salt - sensitive rats ( DS), high - salt ( HS) diet increases BP more in males than females.	[]
In contrast to the systemic renin - angiotensin system, which is suppressed in response to HS in male DS, intrarenal angiotensinogen expression is increased, and intrarenal levels of ANG II are not suppressed.	[]
In this study, the hypothesis was tested that there is a sexual dimorphism in HS - induced upregulation of intrarenal angiotensinogen mediated by testosterone that also causes increases in BP and renal injury.	"renal injury	196	208	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""renal injury"", ""start_span"": 196, ""end_span"": 208, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
On a low - salt ( LS) diet, male DS had higher levels of intrarenal angiotensinogen mRNA than females.	[]
HS diet for 4 wk increased renal cortical angiotensinogen mRNA and protein only in male DS, which was prevented by castration.	[]
Ovariectomy of female DS had no effect on intrarenal angiotensinogen expression on either diet.	[]
Radiotelemetric BP was similar between males and castrated rats on LS diet.	[]
HS diet for 4 wk caused a progressive increase in BP, protein and albumin excretion, and glomerular sclerosis in male DS rats, which were attenuated by castration.

In order to address long - term pain memory, nine healthy male volunteers received intradermal injections of three doses of capsaicin ( 0. 05, 1 and 20 microg, separated by 15 min breaks), each given three times in a balanced design across three sessions at one week intervals.	"pain	32	36	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""pain"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Pain rating was performed using a computerized visual analogue scale ( 0 - 100) digitized at 1 / s, either immediately online or one hour or one day after injection.	"Pain	0	4	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Pain"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Correlation with rating recall after one week was best when first - time ratings were requested as late as one day after injection ( R ( 2) = 0. 79) indicating that both rating retrievals utilized similar memory traces.	[]

PURPOSE: The influence of an irreversible inhibitor of constitutive NO synthase ( L - NOArg; 1. 0 mg / kg ip), a relatively selective inhibitor of inducible NO synthase ( L - NIL; 1. 0 mg / kg ip) and a relatively specific inhibitor of neuronal NO synthase ( 7 - NI; 0. 1 mg / kg ip), on antihyperalgesic action of selective antagonists of B2 and B1 receptors: D - Arg - [ Hyp3, Thi5, D - Tic7, Oic8] bradykinin ( HOE 140; 70 nmol / kg ip) or des Arg10 HOE 140 ( 70 nmol / kg ip) respectively, in model of diabetic ( streptozotocin - induced) and toxic ( vincristine - induced) neuropathy was investigated.

METHODS: The changes in pain thresholds were determined using mechanical stimuli - - the modification of the classic paw withdrawal test described by Randall - Selitto.	"pain	24	28	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""pain"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
RESULTS: The results of this paper confirm that inhibition of bradykinin receptors and inducible NO synthase but not neuronal NO synthase activity reduces diabetic hyperalgesia.

Pretreatment with L - NOArg and L - NIL but not 7 - NI, significantly increases antihyperalgesic activity both HOE 140 and des Arg10 HOE 140.	[]
It was also shown that both products of inducible NO synthase and neuronal NO synthase activation as well as bradykinin are involved in hyperalgesia produced by vincristine.

Moreover, L - NOArg and 7 - NI but not L - NIL intensify antihyperalgesic activity of HOE 140 or des - Arg10HOE 140 in toxic neuropathy.	"toxic neuropathy	119	135	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""toxic neuropathy"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
CONCLUSIONS: Results of these studies suggest that B1 and B2 receptors are engaged in transmission of nociceptive stimuli in both diabetic and toxic neuropathy.	"diabetic and toxic neuropathy	130	159	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""diabetic and toxic neuropathy"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 159, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In streptozotocin - induced hyperalgesia, inducible NO synthase participates in pronociceptive activity of bradykinin, whereas in vincristine - induced hyperalgesia bradykinin seemed to activate neuronal NO synthase pathway.

Therefore, concomitant administration of small doses of bradykinin receptor antagonists and NO synthase inhibitors can be effective in alleviation of neuropathic pain, even in hospital care.

Initial brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) were obtained after the hospitalization, including DWI ( 8 / 8), apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC) map ( 4 / 8), FLAIR ( 7 / 8), and T2 - weighted image ( 8 / 8).	[]
Follow - up MRIs were performed on 5 patients from third to 14th days after discontinuation of metronidazole administration.	[]
Findings of initial and follow - up MRIs were retrospectively evaluated by 2 neuroradiologists by consensus, to analyze the presence of abnormal signal intensities, their locations, and signal changes on follow - up images.	[]
RESULTS: Initial MRIs showed abnormal high signal intensities on DWI and FLAIR ( or T2 - weighted image) at the dentate nucleus ( 8 / 8), inferior colliculus ( 6 / 8), corpus callosum ( 2 / 8), pons ( 2 / 8), medulla ( 1 / 8), and bilateral cerebral white matter ( 1 / 8).	[]
High - signal intensity lesions on DWI tended to show low signal intensity on ADC map ( 3 / 4), but in one patient, high signal intensity was shown at bilateral dentate nuclei on not only DWI but also ADC map.	[]
All the lesions in dentate, inferior colliculus, pons, and medullas had been resolved completely on follow - up MRIs in 5 patients, but in 1 patient of them, corpus callosal lesion persisted.

These lemon essential oils showed strong ability to improve memory impaired by scopolamine; however, s - perillyl alcohol relieved the deficit of associative memory in PA only, and did not improve non - associative memory significantly in OFH.

Disulfiram - like syndrome after hydrogen cyanamide professional skin exposure: two case reports in France.	[]
Hydrogen cyanamide is a plant growth regulator used in agriculture to induce bud break in fruit trees.	[]
Contact with the skin can result in percutaneous absorption of the substance that inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase and can induce acetaldehyde syndrome in case of alcohol use.	[]
The purpose of this report is to describe two cases of a disulfiram - like syndrome following occupational exposure to hydrogen cyanamide.	[]
The first case involved a 59 - year - old man who used Dormex, which contains hydrogen cyanamide, without protection after consuming a large amount of alcohol during a meal.	[]
In less than 1 hour after the ingestion of alcohol, he developed malaise with flushing of the face, tachycardia, and dyspnea.

Comparative cognitive and subjective side effects of immediate - release oxycodone in healthy middle - aged and older adults.	[]
This study measured the objective and subjective neurocognitive effects of a single 10 - mg dose of immediate - release oxycodone in healthy, older ( > 65 years), and middle - aged ( 35 to 55 years) adults who were not suffering from chronic or significant daily pain.

Seventy - one participants completed 2 separate study days and were blind to medication condition ( placebo, 10 - mg oxycodone).	[]
Plasma oxycodone concentration peaked between 60 and 90 minutes postdose ( P <. 01) and pupil size, an indication of physiological effects of the medication, peaked at approximately 90 to 120 minutes postdose ( P <. 01).	[]
Significant declines in simple and sustained attention, working memory, and verbal memory were observed at 1 hour postdose compared to baseline for both age groups with a trend toward return to baseline by 5 hours postdose.	[]
For almost all cognitive measures, there were no medication by age - interaction effects, which indicates that the 2 age groups exhibited similar responses to the medication challenge.	[]
This study suggests that for healthy older adults who are not suffering from chronic pain, neurocognitive and pharmacodynamic changes in response to a 10 - mg dose of immediate - release oxycodone are similar to those observed for middle - aged adults.

PERSPECTIVE: Study findings indicate that the metabolism, neurocognitive effects, and physical side effects of oral oxycodone are similar for healthy middle - aged and older adults.	[]
Therefore, clinicians should not avoid prescribing oral opioids to older adults based on the belief that older adults are at higher risk for side effects than younger adults.	[]
The glycine transporter - 1 inhibitor SSR103800 displays a selective and specific antipsychotic - like profile in normal and transgenic mice.	[]
Schizophrenia has been initially associated with dysfunction in dopamine neurotransmission.	"Schizophrenia	0	13	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Schizophrenia"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
However, the observation that antagonists of the glutamate N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA) receptor produce schizophrenic - like symptoms in humans has led to the idea of a dysfunctioning of the glutamatergic system via its NMDA receptor.	"schizophrenic	111	124	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""schizophrenic"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
As a result, there is a growing interest in the development of pharmacological agents with potential antipsychotic properties that enhance the activity of the glutamatergic system via a modulation of the NMDA receptor.	[]
Among them are glycine transporter - 1 ( GlyT1) inhibitors such as SSR103800, which indirectly enhance NMDA receptor function by increasing the glycine ( a co - agonist for the NMDA receptor) levels in the synapse.	[]
This study aimed at investigating the potential antipsychotic - like properties of SSR103800, with a particular focus on models of hyperactivity, involving either drug challenge ( ie, amphetamine and MK - 801) or transgenic mice ( ie, NMDA Nr1 ( neo - / -) and DAT ( - / -)).

Results showed that SSR103800 ( 10 - 30 mg / kg p. o.) blocked hyperactivity induced by the non - competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, MK - 801 and partially reversed spontaneous hyperactivity of NMDA Nr1 ( neo - / -) mice.

In contrast, SSR103800 failed to affect hyperactivity induced by amphetamine or naturally observed in dopamine transporter ( DAT ( - / -)) knockout mice ( 10 - 30 mg / kg p. o.).	"hyperactivity	40	53	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hyperactivity"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Importantly, both classical ( haloperidol) and atypical ( olanzapine, clozapine and aripiprazole) antipsychotics were effective in all these models of hyperactivity.	"hyperactivity	151	164	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hyperactivity"", ""start_span"": 151, ""end_span"": 164, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
However, unlike these latter, SSR103800 did not produce catalepsy ( retention on the bar test) up to 30 mg / kg p. o.	"catalepsy	56	65	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""catalepsy"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Together these findings show that the GlyT1 inhibitor, SSR103800, produces antipsychotic - like effects, which differ from those observed with compounds primarily targeting the dopaminergic system, and has a reduced side - effect potential as compared with these latter drugs.	[]

Less frequent lithium administration and lower urine volume.	[]
OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to determine whether patients maintained on a regimen of lithium on a once - per - day schedule have lower urine volumes than do patients receiving multiple doses per day.	[]
METHOD: This was a cross - sectional study of 85 patients from a lithium clinic who received different dose schedules.	[]
Patients were admitted to the hospital for measurement of lithium level, creatinine clearance, urine volume, and maximum osmolality.	[]
RESULTS: Multiple daily doses of lithium were associated with higher urine volumes.	[]
The dosing schedule, duration of lithium treatment, and daily dose of lithium did not affect maximum osmolality or creatinine clearance.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: Urine volume can be reduced by giving lithium once daily and / or by lowering the total daily dose.	[]

Differential impact of immune escape mutations G145R and P120T on the replication of lamivudine - resistant hepatitis B virus e antigen - positive and - negative strains.	[]
Immune escape variants of the hepatitis B virus ( HBV) represent an emerging clinical challenge, because they can be associated with vaccine escape, HBV reactivation, and failure of diagnostic tests.	"hepatitis B	30	41	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hepatitis B"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Recent data suggest a preferential selection of immune escape mutants in distinct peripheral blood leukocyte compartments of infected individuals.	[]
We therefore systematically analyzed the functional impact of the most prevalent immune escape variants, the sG145R and sP120T mutants, on the viral replication efficacy and antiviral drug susceptibility of common treatment - associated mutants with resistance to lamivudine ( LAM) and / or HBeAg negativity.	[]
Replication - competent HBV strains with sG145R or sP120T and LAM resistance ( rtM204I or rtL180M / rtM204V) were generated on an HBeAg - positive and an HBeAg - negative background with precore ( PC) and basal core promoter ( BCP) mutants.	[]
The sG145R mutation strongly reduced HBsAg levels and was able to fully restore the impaired replication of LAM - resistant HBV mutants to the levels of wild - type HBV, and PC or BCP mutations further enhanced viral replication.	[]
Although the sP120T substitution also impaired HBsAg secretion, it did not enhance the replication of LAM - resistant clones.	[]
However, the concomitant occurrence of HBeAg negativity ( PC / BCP), sP120T, and LAM resistance resulted in the restoration of replication to levels of wild - type HBV.	[]
In all clones with combined immune escape and LAM resistance mutations, the nucleotide analogues adefovir and tenofovir remained effective in suppressing viral replication in vitro.	[]
These findings reveal the differential impact of immune escape variants on the replication and drug susceptibility of complex HBV mutants, supporting the need of close surveillance and treatment adjustment in response to the selection of distinct mutational patterns.	[]

RESULTS: Induction of anesthesia was followed by a decrease in MAP, HR, SV, and CO concomitant with an elevation in S ( c) O ( 2).	[]
After administration of phenylephrine, MAP increased ( 51 + / - 12 to 81 + / - 13 mmHg; P < 0. 001; mean + / - SD).	[]
However, a 14% ( from 70 + / - 8% to 60 + / - 7%) reduction in S ( c) O ( 2) ( P < 0. 05) followed with no change in CO ( 3. 7 + / - 1. 1 to 3. 4 + / - 0. 9 l min ( - 1)).	[]
The administration of ephedrine led to a similar increase in MAP ( 53 + / - 9 to 79 + / - 8 mmHg; P < 0. 001), restored CO ( 3. 2 + / - 1. 2 to 5. 0 + / - 1. 3 l min ( - 1)), and preserved S ( c) O ( 2).	[]
CONCLUSIONS: The utilization of phenylephrine to correct hypotension induced by anesthesia has a negative impact on S ( c) O ( 2) while ephedrine maintains frontal lobe oxygenation potentially related to an increase in CO.

Normalizing effects of modafinil on sleep in chronic cocaine users.	[]
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of morning - dosed modafinil on sleep and daytime sleepiness in chronic cocaine users.	"daytime sleepiness	114	132	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""daytime sleepiness"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
METHOD: Twenty cocaine - dependent participants were randomly assigned to receive modafinil, 400 mg ( N = 10), or placebo ( N = 10) every morning at 7: 30 a. m. for 16 days in an inpatient, double - blind randomized trial.	[]
Participants underwent polysomnographic sleep recordings on days 1 to 3, 7 to 9, and 14 to 16 ( first, second, and third weeks of abstinence).	[]
The Multiple Sleep Latency Test was performed at 11: 30 a. m., 2: 00 p. m., and 4: 30 p. m. on days 2, 8, and 15.	[]
For comparison of sleep architecture variables, 12 healthy comparison participants underwent a single night of experimental polysomnography that followed 1 night of accommodation polysomnography.	[]
RESULTS: Progressive abstinence from cocaine was associated with worsening of all measured polysomnographic sleep outcomes.	[]
Compared with placebo, modafinil decreased nighttime sleep latency and increased slow - wave sleep time in cocaine - dependent participants.	[]
The effect of modafinil interacted with the abstinence week and was associated with longer total sleep time and shorter REM sleep latency in the third week of abstinence.	[]
Comparison of slow - wave sleep time, total sleep time, and sleep latency in cocaine - dependent and healthy participants revealed a normalizing effect of modafinil in cocaine - dependent participants.	[]
Modafinil was associated with increased daytime sleep latency, as measured by the Multiple Sleep Latency Test, and a nearly significant decrease in subjective daytime sleepiness.

METHOD: prospective study with 137 patients that underwent TEE with MZ associated to moderate sedation.	[]
We analyzed the following events: complications related with the topical anesthesia, with MZ use and with the procedure.	[]
Uni - and multivariate analyses were used to test the influence of the clinical variables: age, sex, stroke, myocardiopathy ( MP), duration of the test, mitral regurgitation ( MR) and the MZ dose.

Methylergonovine was administered continuously at a rate of 10 micrograms / min up to 50 micrograms.	[]
In all patients with variant angina, coronary spasm was provoked at a mean dose of 28 + / - 13 micrograms ( mean + / - SD).

In the control group neither ischemic ST change nor localized spasm occurred.	"spasm	62	67	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""spasm"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The basal tone of the right coronary artery was significantly lower than that of the left coronary artery.	[]
The percentage of vasoconstriction of the right coronary artery was significantly higher than that of the left coronary artery.	[]
These results suggest that spasm provocation tests, which use an intracoronary injection of a relatively low dose of methylergonovine, have a high sensitivity in variant angina and the vasoreactivity of the right coronary artery may be greater than that of the other coronary arteries.

Cocaine causes memory and learning impairments in rats: involvement of nuclear factor kappa B and oxidative stress, and prevention by topiramate.

Different mechanisms have been suggested for cocaine toxicity including an increase in oxidative stress but the association between oxidative status in the brain and cocaine induced - behaviour is poorly understood.

Nuclear factor kappa B ( NFkappaB) is a sensor of oxidative stress and participates in memory formation that could be involved in drug toxicity and addiction mechanisms.

Therefore NFkappaB activity, oxidative stress, neuronal nitric oxide synthase ( nNOS) activity, spatial learning and memory as well as the effect of topiramate, a previously proposed therapy for cocaine addiction, were evaluated in an experimental model of cocaine administration in rats.	"cocaine addiction	195	212	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cocaine addiction"", ""start_span"": 195, ""end_span"": 212, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
NFkappaB activity was decreased in the frontal cortex of cocaine treated rats, as well as GSH concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity in the hippocampus, whereas nNOS activity in the hippocampus was increased.	[]
Memory retrieval of experiences acquired prior to cocaine administration was impaired and negatively correlated with NFkappaB activity in the frontal cortex.	[]
In contrast, learning of new tasks was enhanced and correlated with the increase of nNOS activity and the decrease of glutathione peroxidase.	[]
These results provide evidence for a possible mechanistic role of oxidative and nitrosative stress and NFkappaB in the alterations induced by cocaine.	[]
Topiramate prevented all the alterations observed, showing novel neuroprotective properties.	[]

METHODS: Thoracic aorta of male Sprague - Dawley rats was exposed to 0. 5M CaCl ( 2) or normal saline ( NaCl).	[]
After 12weeks, animals were euthanized, and CaCl ( 2) - treated, CaCl ( 2) - untreated ( n = 12) and NaCl - treated aortic segments ( n = 12) were collected for histological and molecular assessments.	[]
MMP - TIMP and ADAM mRNAs were semi - quantitatively analyzed and protein expressions were determined by immunohistochemistry.	[]
RESULTS: Despite similar external diameters among CaCl ( 2) - treated, non - CaCl ( 2) - treated and NaCl - treated segments, aneurymal alteration ( n = 6, 50%), media degeneration with regional disruption, fragmentation of elastic fiber, and increased collagen deposition ( n = 12, 100%) were demonstrated in CaCl ( 2) - treated segments.	[]
MMP - 2, MMP - 9, ADAM - 10 and ADAM - 17 mRNA levels were increased in CaCl ( 2) - treated segments ( all p < 0. 01), with trends of elevation in CaCl ( 2) - untreated segments, as compared with NaCl - treated segments.	[]
Immunohistochemistry displayed significantly increased expressions of MMP - 2, MMP - 9, ADAM - 10 and ADAM - 17 ( all p < 0. 01) in intima and media for CaCl ( 2) - treated segments.	[]
TIMP mRNA and tissue levels did not differ obviously among the three aortic segments.	[]
CONCLUSION: This study establishes a TAA model by periarterial CaCl ( 2) exposure in rats, and demonstrates a significant elevation of expression of MMP - 2, MMP - 9, ADAM10 and ADAM17 in the pathogenesis of vascular remodeling.

OBJECTIVE: The globus pallidus plays a critical role in movement regulation.	[]
Previous studies have indicated that the globus pallidus receives neurotensinergic innervation from the striatum, and systemic administration of a neurotensin analog could produce antiparkinsonian effects.	[]
The present study aimed to investigate the effects of pallidal neurotensin on haloperidol - induced parkinsonian symptoms.	"parkinsonian symptoms	100	121	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""parkinsonian symptoms"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
METHODS: Behavioral experiments and electrophysiological recordings were performed in the present study.	[]
RESULTS: Bilateral infusions of neurotensin into the globus pallidus reversed haloperidol - induced parkinsonian catalepsy in rats.	"parkinsonian catalepsy	100	122	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""parkinsonian catalepsy"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Electrophysiological recordings showed that microinjection of neurotensin induced excitation of pallidal neurons in the presence of systemic haloperidol administration.	[]
The neurotensin type - 1 receptor antagonist SR48692 blocked both the behavioral and the electrophysiological effects induced by neurotensin.	[]
CONCLUSION: Activation of pallidal neurotensin receptors may be involved in neurotensin - induced antiparkinsonian effects.	[]

Butyrylcholinesterase gene mutations in patients with prolonged apnea after succinylcholine for electroconvulsive therapy.	"apnea	64	69	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""apnea"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
BACKGROUND: patients undergoing electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT) often receive succinylcholine as part of the anesthetic procedure.	[]
The duration of action may be prolonged in patients with genetic variants of the butyrylcholinesterase enzyme ( BChE), the most common being the K - and the A - variants.	[]
The aim of the study was to assess the clinical significance of genetic variants in butyrylcholinesterase gene ( BCHE) in patients with a suspected prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine after ECT.	[]
METHODS: a total of 13 patients were referred to the Danish Cholinesterase Research Unit after ECT during 38 months.	[]
We determined the BChE activity and the BCHE genotype using molecular genetic methods, the duration of apnea, time to sufficient spontaneous ventilation and whether neuromuscular monitoring was used.

RESULTS: in 11 patients, mutations were found in the BCHE gene, the K - variant being the most frequent.	[]
The duration of apnea was 5 - 15 min compared with 3 - 5. 3 min from the literature.	"apnea	16	21	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""apnea"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Severe distress was noted in the recovery phase in two patients.	[]
Neuromuscular monitoring was used in two patients.	[]
CONCLUSION: eleven of 13 patients with a prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine had mutations in BCHE, indicating that this is the possible reason for a prolonged period of apnea.

Muscle strength, contractures, functional ability and pulmonary function were tested at baseline, and 6 and 12 months after treatment with mazindol ( 3 mg / d) or placebo.	[]
The study was designed to have a power of greater than 0. 90 to detect a slowing to 25% of the expected rate of progression of weakness at P less than 0. 05.	"weakness	127	135	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""weakness"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Mazindol did not benefit strength at any point in the study.	[]
Side effects attributable to mazindol included decreased appetite ( 36%), dry mouth ( 10%), behavioral change ( 22%), and gastrointestinal symptoms ( 18%); mazindol dosage was reduced in 43% of patients.

Facilitation of memory retrieval by pre - test morphine and its state dependency in the step - through type passive avoidance learning test in mice.	[]
Amnesia produced by scopolamine and cycloheximide were reversed by morphine given 30 min before the test trial ( pre - test), and pre - test morphine also facilitated the memory retrieval in the animals administered naloxone during the training trial.	"Amnesia	0	7	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Amnesia"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Similarly, pre - test scopolamine partially reversed the scopolamine - induced amnesia, but not significantly; and pre - test cycloheximide failed to reverse the cycloheximide - induced amnesia.

These results suggest that the facilitation of memory retrieval by pre - test morphine might be the direct action of morphine rather than a state dependent effect.	[]
Naloxone reverses the antihypertensive effect of clonidine.	[]
In unanesthetized, spontaneously hypertensive rats the decrease in blood pressure and heart rate produced by intravenous clonidine, 5 to 20 micrograms / kg, was inhibited or reversed by nalozone, 0. 2 to 2 mg / kg.

Naloxone alone did not affect either blood pressure or heart rate.	[]
In brain membranes from spontaneously hypertensive rats clonidine, 10 ( - 8) to 10 ( - 5) M, did not influence stereoselective binding of [ 3H] - naloxone ( 8 nM), and naloxone, 10 ( - 8) to 10 ( - 4) M, did not influence clonidine - suppressible binding of [ 3H] - dihydroergocryptine ( 1 nM).

In vitro, gamma - HCH, pentylenetetrazol and picrotoxin were shown to inhibit 3H - TBOB binding in mouse whole brain, with IC50 values of 4. 6, 404 and 9. 4 microM, respectively.	[]
MPA, BCC, DMCM, and STR showed no inhibition of 3H - TBOB ( t - butyl bicyclo - orthobenzoate) binding at concentrations of 100 micron.	[]
The pharmacological challenge data suggest that tolerance may occur to seizure activity induced by PTZ and PTX 24 h after gamma - HCH, since the response to only these two seizure - inducing agents is decreased.

Mouse strain - dependent effect of amantadine on motility and brain biogenic amines.	[]
The effect of amantadine hydrochloride, injected i. p. in 6 increments of 100 mg / kg each over 30 hr, on mouse motility and whole brain content of selected biogenic amines and major metabolites was studied in 4 strains of mice.	[]
These were the albino Sprague - Dawley ICR and BALB / C, the black C57BL / 6 and the brown CDF - I mouse strains.	[]
Amantadine treatment produced a biphasic effect on mouse motility.	[]

The locomotor activity was decreased from corresponding controls in all strains studied, except for the ICR mice, during an overnight drug - free period following the fourth amantadine treatment.	[]
Readministration of amantadine, after a drug - free overnight period, increased motility from respective saline control in all strains with exception of the BALB / C mice where suppression of motility occurred.

Treatment with amantadine did not alter whole brain dopamine levels but decreased the amounts of 3, 4 - dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in the BALB / C mice compared to saline control.	[]
Conversely, brain normetanephrine concentration was increased from saline control by amantadine in the BALB / C mice.	[]
The results suggest a strain - dependent effect of amantadine on motility and indicate a differential response to the acute and multiple dose regimens used.	[]
The BALB / C mouse was the most sensitive strain and could serve as the strain of choice for evaluating the side effects of amantadine.	[]
The biochemical results of brain biogenic amines of BALB / C mouse strain suggest a probable decrease of catecholamine turnover rate and / or metabolism by monoamine oxidase and a resulting increase in O - methylation of norepinephrine which may account for a behavioral depression caused by amantadine in the BALB / C mice.

To test the validity of the hypothesis that hypomethylation of DNA plays an important role in the initiation of carcinogenic process, 5 - azacytidine ( 5 - AzC) ( 10 mg / kg), an inhibitor of DNA methylation, was given to rats during the phase of repair synthesis induced by the three carcinogens, benzo [ a] - pyrene ( 200 mg / kg), N - methyl - N - nitrosourea ( 60 mg / kg) and 1, 2 - dimethylhydrazine ( 1, 2 - DMH) ( 100 mg / kg).

The initiated hepatocytes in the liver were assayed as the gamma - glutamyltransferase ( gamma - GT) positive foci formed following a 2 - week selection regimen consisting of dietary 0. 02% 2 - acetylaminofluorene coupled with a necrogenic dose of CCl4.	[]
The results obtained indicate that with all three carcinogens, administration of 5 - AzC during repair synthesis increased the incidence of initiated hepatocytes, for example 10 - 20 foci / cm2 in 5 - AzC and carcinogen - treated rats compared with 3 - 5 foci / cm2 in rats treated with carcinogen only.	[]
Administration of [ 3H] - 5 - azadeoxycytidine during the repair synthesis induced by 1, 2 - DMH further showed that 0. 019 mol% of cytosine residues in DNA were substituted by the analogue, indicating that incorporation of 5 - AzC occurs during repair synthesis.	[]
In the absence of the carcinogen, 5 - AzC given after a two thirds partial hepatectomy, when its incorporation should be maximum, failed to induce any gamma - GT positive foci.	[]
The results suggest that hypomethylation of DNA per se may not be sufficient for initiation.	[]
Perhaps two events might be necessary for initiation, the first caused by the carcinogen and a second involving hypomethylation of DNA.	[]

The lung weights were lower and PaO2 was improved in rats given this enzyme - blocking agent.	[]
The contents of albumin in the lungs were not changed, indicating that Captopril did not influence the extravasation of protein.	[]
Renal damage as reflected by an increase in serum urea and in kidney weight was prevented by Captopril.	"Renal damage	0	12	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Renal damage"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The amount of fibrin in the kidneys was also considerably lower than in animals which received thrombin and AMCA alone.	[]
It is suggested that the effects of Captopril on the lungs may be attributable to a vasodilatory effect due to a reduction in the circulating level of Angiotension II and an increase in prostacyclin ( secondary to an increase in bradykinin).	[]
Captopril may, by the same mechanism, reduce the increase in glomerular filtration that is known to occur after an injection of thrombin, thereby diminishing the aggregation of fibrin monomers in the glomeruli, with the result that less fibrin will be deposited and thus less kidney damage will be produced.

In salt - depleted rats, amphotericin B decreased creatinine clearance linearly with time, with an 85% reduction by week 3.	[]
In contrast, in normal - salt rats creatinine clearance was decreased but to a lesser extent at week 2 and 3, and in salt - loaded rats creatinine clearance did not change for 2 weeks and was decreased by 43% at week 3.	[]
All rats in the sodium - depleted group had histopathological evidence of patchy tubular cytoplasmic degeneration in tubules that was not observed in any normal - salt or salt - loaded rat.	[]
Concentrations of amphotericin B in plasma were not significantly different among the three groups at any time during the study.	[]
However, at the end of 3 weeks, amphotericin B levels in the kidneys and liver were significantly higher in salt - depleted and normal - salt rats than those in salt - loaded rats, with plasma / kidney ratios of 21, 14, and 8 in salt - depleted, normal - salt, and salt - loaded rats, respectively.

In conclusion, reductions in creatinine clearance and renal amphotericin B accumulation after chronic amphotericin B administration were enhanced by salt depletion and attenuated by sodium loading in rats.	[]
Flestolol: an ultra - short - acting beta - adrenergic blocking agent.	[]
Flestolol ( ACC - 9089) is a nonselective, competitive, ultra - short - acting beta - adrenergic blocking agent, without any intrinsic sympathomimetic activity.	[]
Flestolol is metabolized by plasma esterases and has an elimination half - life of approximately 6. 5 minutes.	[]
This agent was well tolerated in healthy volunteers at doses up to 100 micrograms / kg / min.	[]
In long - term infusion studies, flestolol was well tolerated at the effective beta - blocking dose ( 5 micrograms / kg / min) for up to seven days.	[]
Flestolol blood concentrations increased linearly with increasing dose and good correlation exists between blood concentrations of flestolol and beta - adrenergic blockade.	[]
Flestolol produced a dose - dependent attenuation of isoproterenol - induced tachycardia.	"tachycardia	77	88	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tachycardia"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Morphometric analysis revealed that the volume density of secretory granules increased, while the volume density of cytoplasmic microtubules decreased.	[]
These findings suggest that lowered serum prolactin levels in the early phase of bromocriptine treatment may result from an impaired secretion of prolactin due to decreasing numbers of cytoplasmic microtubules.	[]
At 6 h after injection, serum prolactin levels were still considerably lower than in controls.	[]

Inhibition of sympathoadrenal activity by atrial natriuretic factor in dogs.	[]
In six conscious, trained dogs, maintained on a normal sodium intake of 2 to 4 mEq / kg / day, sympathetic activity was assessed as the release rate of norepinephrine and epinephrine during 15 - minute i. v. infusions of human alpha - atrial natriuretic factor.	[]

( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	[]
Inhibition of immunoreactive corticotropin - releasing factor secretion into the hypophysial - portal circulation by delayed glucocorticoid feedback.	[]
Nitroprusside - induced hypotension evokes ACTH secretion which is primarily mediated by enhanced secretion of immunoreactive corticotropin - releasing factor ( irCRF) into the hypophysial - portal circulation.	"hypotension	24	35	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hypotension"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Portal plasma concentrations of neither arginine vasopressin nor oxytocin are significantly altered in this paradigm.	[]
Application of a delayed feedback signal, in the form of a 2 - h systemic corticosterone infusion in urethane - anesthetized rats with pharmacological blockade of glucocorticoid synthesis, is without effect on the resting secretion of arginine vasopressin and oxytocin at any corticosterone feedback dose tested.	[]
Resting irCRF levels are suppressed only at the highest corticosterone infusion rate, which resulted in systemic corticosterone levels of 40 micrograms / dl.	[]
Suppression of irCRF secretion in response to nitroprusside - induced hypotension is observed and occurs at a plasma corticosterone level between 8 - 12 micrograms / dl.	"hypotension	70	81	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hypotension"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
These studies provide further evidence for a strong central component of the delayed feedback process which is mediated by modulation of irCRF release.	[]
Noradrenergic involvement in catalepsy induced by delta 9 - tetrahydrocannabinol.	"catalepsy	29	38	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""catalepsy"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In order to elucidate the role of the catecholaminergic system in the cataleptogenic effect of delta 9 - tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC), the effect of pretreatment with 6 - hydroxydopamine ( 6 - OHDA) or with desipramine and 6 - OHDA and lesions of the locus coeruleus were investigated in rats.	[]
The cataleptogenic effect of THC was significantly reduced in rats treated with 6 - OHDA and in rats with lesions of the locus coeruleus but not in rats treated with desipramine and 6 - OHDA, as compared with control rats.	[]
On the contrary, the cataleptogenic effect of haloperidol was significantly reduced in rats treated with desipramine and 6 - OHDA but not in rats treated with 6 - OHDA or in rats with lesions of the locus coeruleus.	[]
These results indicate that noradrenergic neurons have an important role in the manifestation of catalepsy induced by THC, whereas dopaminergic neurons are important in catalepsy induced by haloperidol.

HMG CoA reductase inhibitors.	[]
Current clinical experience.	[]
Lovastatin and simvastatin are the 2 best - known members of the class of hypolipidaemic agents known as HMG CoA reductase inhibitors.	[]
Clinical experience with lovastatin includes over 5000 patients, 700 of whom have been treated for 2 years or more, and experience with simvastatin includes over 3500 patients, of whom 350 have been treated for 18 months or more.	[]
Lovastatin has been marketed in the United States for over 6 months.	[]
Both agents show substantial clinical efficacy, with reductions in total cholesterol of over 30% and in LDL - cholesterol of 40% in clinical studies.	[]
Modest increases in HDL - cholesterol levels of about 10% are also reported.	[]
Clinical tolerability of both agents has been good, with fewer than 3% of patients withdrawn from treatment because of clinical adverse experiences.	[]
Ophthalmological examinations in over 1100 patients treated with one or the other agent have revealed no evidence of significant short term ( up to 2 years) cataractogenic potential.	[]
One to 2% of patients have elevations of serum transaminases to greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal.	[]
These episodes are asymptomatic and reversible when therapy is discontinued.	[]
Minor elevations of creatine kinase levels are reported in about 5% of patients.	[]
Myopathy, associated in some cases with myoglobinuria, and in 2 cases with transient renal failure, has been rarely reported with lovastatin, especially in patients concomitantly treated with cyclosporin, gemfibrozil or niacin.

Formation of these plugs was probably due to extensive tumor necrosis at the level of the walls of the major uterine veins, which resulted in an open exchange of tumor plugs to the vascular spaces; decrease in tumor tissue coherence secondary to chemotherapy may have further contributed to the formation of tumor emboli.

Pulmonary shunt and cardiovascular responses to CPAP during nitroprusside - induced hypotension.	"hypotension	84	95	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hypotension"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The effects of continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP) on cardiovascular dynamics and pulmonary shunt ( QS / QT) were investigated in 12 dogs before and during sodium nitroprusside infusion that decreased mean arterial blood pressure 40 - 50 per cent.	[]
Before nitroprusside infusion, 5 cm H2O CPAP significantly, P less than. 05, decreased arterial blood pressure, but did not significantly alter heart rate, cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, or QS / QT.	[]
Ten cm H2O CPAP before nitroprusside infusion produced a further decrease in arterial blood pressure and significantly increased heart rate and decreased cardiac output and QS / QT.

Five cm H2O CPAP during nitroprusside did not further alter any of the above - mentioned variables.	[]
However, 10 cm H2O CPAP decreased arterial blood pressure, cardiac output, and QS / QT.	[]
These data indicate that nitroprusside infusion rates that decrease mean arterial blood pressure by 40 - 50 per cent do not change cardiac output or QS / QT.	[]
During nitroprusside infusion low levels of CPAP do not markedly alter cardiovascular dynamics, but high levels of CPAP ( 10 cm H2O), while decreasing QS / QT, produce marked decreases in arterial blood pressure and cardiac output.

The systemic, central venous, pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and heart rates, were similar in the two groups.	[]
Analysis of the respiratory changes in the arterial pressure waveform enabled differentiation between the two groups.	[]
The SPV during hypotension was 15. 7 + / - 6. 7 mm Hg in the HEM group, compared with 9. 1 + / - 2. 0 mm Hg in the SNP group ( P less than 0. 02).

The delta down, which is the measure of decrease of SBP after a mechanical breath, was 20. 3 + / - 8. 4 and 10. 1 + / - 3. 8 mm Hg in the HEM and SNP groups, respectively, during hypotension ( P less than 0. 02).

Since 18 of the 22 patients were initially receiving deferoxamine doses in excess of the commonly recommended 50 mg / kg per dose, therapy was restarted with lower doses, usually 50 mg / kg per dose or less depending on the degree of auditory abnormality, and with the exception of two cases no further toxicity was demonstrated.

Based on these data, a plan of management was developed that allows effective yet safe administration of deferoxamine.	[]
A dose of 50 mg / kg is recommended in those without audiogram abnormalities.	[]

Moderate abnormalities require a reduction of deferoxamine to 25 mg / kg per dose with careful monitoring.	[]
In those with symptoms of hearing loss, the drug should be stopped for four weeks, and when the audiogram is stable or improved, therapy should be restarted at 10 to 25 mg / kg per dose.

Hyperkalemia has recently been recognized as a complication of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents ( NSAID) such as indomethacin.	"Hyperkalemia	0	12	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Hyperkalemia"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Several recent studies have stressed the renal sparing features of sulindac, owing to its lack of interference with renal prostacyclin synthesis.	[]
We describe 4 patients in whom hyperkalemia ranging from 6. 1 to 6. 9 mEq / l developed within 3 to 8 days of sulindac administration.	"hyperkalemia	31	43	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hyperkalemia"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In all of them normal serum potassium levels reached within 2 to 4 days of stopping sulindac.	[]
As no other medications known to effect serum potassium had been given concomitantly, this course of events is suggestive of a cause - and - effect relationship between sulindac and hyperkalemia.

Regional localization of the antagonism of amphetamine - induced hyperactivity by intracerebral calcitonin injections.	"hyperactivity	65	78	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hyperactivity"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Calcitonin receptors are found in the brain, and intracerebral infusions of calcitonin can produce behavioral effects.	[]
Among these behavioral effects are decreases in food intake and decreases in amphetamine - induced locomotor activity.	[]
In previous experiments we found that decreases in food intake were induced by local administration of calcitonin into several hypothalamic sites and into the nucleus accumbens.	[]
In the present experiment calcitonin decreased locomotor activity when locally injected into the same sites where it decreases food intake.	[]
The areas where calcitonin is most effective in decreasing locomotor activity are located in the hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens, suggesting that these areas are the major sites of action of calcitonin in inhibiting amphetamine - induced locomotor activity.	[]

In four subacute toxicity studies, the intravenous administration of cefonicid or cefazedone to beagle dogs caused a dose - dependent incidence of anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia after 1 - 3 months of treatment.

A nonregenerative anemia was the most compromising of the cytopenias and occurred in approximately 50% of dogs receiving 400 - 500 mg / kg cefonicid or 540 - 840 mg / kg cefazedone.

All three cytopenias were completely reversible following cessation of treatment; the time required for recovery of the erythron ( approximately 1 month) was considerably longer than that of the granulocytes and platelets ( hours to a few days).

Upon rechallenge with either cephalosporin, the hematologic syndrome was reproduced in most dogs tested; cefonicid ( but not cefazedone) - treated dogs showed a substantially reduced induction period ( 15 + / - 5 days) compared to that of the first exposure to the drug ( 61 + / - 24 days).	"hematologic syndrome	48	68	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hematologic syndrome"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
This observation, along with the rapid rate of decline in red cell mass parameters of affected dogs, suggests that a hemolytic component complicated the red cell production problem and that multiple toxicologic mechanisms contributed to the cytopenia.

We conclude that the administration of high doses of cefonicid or cefazedone to dogs can induce hematotoxicity similar to the cephalosporin - induced blood dyscrasias described in man and thus provides a useful model for studying the mechanisms of these disorders.

A patient who allegedly consumed 100 tablets of an over - the - counter analgesic containing sodium acetylsalicylate, caffeine, and acetaminophen displayed no significant CNS stimulation despite the presence of 175 micrograms of caffeine per mL of serum.	[]
Because salicylates have been reported to augment the stimulatory effects of caffeine on the CNS, attention was focused on the possibility that the presence of acetaminophen ( 52 micrograms / mL) reduced the CNS toxicity of caffeine.

The effect of high dose D - penicillamine treatment on aortic permeability to albumin and on the ultrastructure of the vessel.	[]
Male Sprague - Dawley rats were treated with D - penicillamine ( D - pen) 500 mg / kg / day for 10 or 42 days.	[]
Pair fed rats served as controls.	[]
Changes in aortic morphology were examined by light - and transmission - electron microscopy ( TEM).	[]
In addition, the endothelial permeability and the penetration through the aortic wall of albumin were studied 10 minutes, 24 and 48 hours after i. v. injection of human serum 131I - albumin ( 131I - HSA).	[]
TEM revealed extensive elastolysis in the arterial wall of D - pen - treated rats, consistent with an inhibitory effect on crosslink formation.	[]
In experimental animals excess deposition of collagen and glycoaminoglycans was observed in the subendothelial and medial layer of the aortic wall, together with prominent basal membrane substance around aortic smooth muscle cells.	[]
The aorta / serum - ratio and the radioactive build - up 24 and 48 hours after injection of 131I - HSA was reduced in animals treated with D - pen for 42 days, indicating an impeded transmural transport of tracer which may be caused by a steric exclusion effect of abundant hyaluronate.	[]
The endothelial ultrastructure was unaffected by D - pen, and no differences in aortic 131I - HSA radioactivity or aorta / serum - ratio were recorded between experimental and control groups 10 minutes after tracer injection, indicating that the permeability of the endothelial barrier to albumin remained unaffected by D - pen treatment.	[]
These observations support the hypothesis that treatment with high doses of D - pen may induce a fibroproliferative response in rat aorta, possibly by an inhibitory effect on the cross - linking of collagen and elastin.	[]

FANFT - induced cell proliferation in the bladder was significantly suppressed by aspirin co - administration after 4 weeks but not after 12 weeks.	[]
In the forestomach, and also in the liver, aspirin did not affect the FANFT - induced increase in labeling index.	[]
The present results are consistent with the carcinogenicity experiment suggesting that different mechanisms are involved in FANFT carcinogenesis in the bladder and forestomach, and that aspirin ' s effect on FANFT in the forestomach is not due to an irritant effect associated with increased cell proliferation.

Blood pressure response to chronic low - dose intrarenal noradrenaline infusion in conscious rats.	[]
Sodium chloride solution ( 0. 9%) or noradrenaline in doses of 4, 12 and 36 micrograms h - 1 kg - 1 was infused for five consecutive days, either intrarenally ( by a new technique) or intravenously into rats with one kidney removed.	[]

Over a range of 1 - 150 days of DES treatment, pairs of control and DES - treated rats were sacrificed, and their pituitaries dissociated enzymatically into single - cell preparations.	[]
The cell populations were examined regarding total cell recovery correlated with gland weight, intracellular prolactin ( PRL) content and subsequent release in primary culture, immunocytochemical PRL staining, density and / or size alterations via separation on Ficoll - Hypaque and by unit gravity sedimentation, and cell cycle analysis, after acriflavine DNA staining, by laser flow cytometry.	[]
Total cell yields from DES - treated pituitaries increased from 1. 3 times control yields at 8 days of treatment to 58. 9 times control values by day 150.	[]
Intracellular PRL content ranged from 1. 9 to 9. 4 times control levels, and PRL release in vitro was significantly and consistently higher than controls, after at least 8 days of DES exposure.	[]
Beyond 8 days of DES exposure, the immunochemically PRL - positive proportion of cells increased to over 50% of the total population.	[]
Increased density and / or size and PRL content were indicated for the majority of the PRL cell population in both types of separation protocols.	[]
All these effects of DES were more pronounced among previously ovariectomized animals.	[]

Age and renal clearance of cimetidine.	[]
In 35 patients ( ages 20 to 86 yr) receiving cimetidine therapeutically two serum samples and all urine formed in the interim were collected for analysis of cimetidine by high - pressure liquid chromatography and for creatinine.	[]
Cimetidine clearance decreased with age.	[]
The extrapolated 6 - hr serum concentration of cimetidine per unit dose, after intravenous cimetidine, increased with age of the patients.	[]
The ratio of cimetidine clearance to creatinine clearance ( Rc) averaged 4. 8 + / - 2. 0, indicating net tubular secretion for cimetidine.	[]
Rc seemed to be independent of age and decreased with increasing serum concentration of cimetidine, suggesting that secretion of cimetidine is a saturable process.	[]
There was only one case of dementia possibly due to cimetidine ( with a drug level of 1. 9 microgram / ml 6 hr after a dose) in a group of 13 patients without liver or kidney disease who had cimetidine levels above 1. 25 microgram / ml.

Adriamycin inhibited cell growth and the rhythmic contractions characteristic of myocardial cells in culture.	[]
A possible involvement of energy metabolism was suggested previously, and in this study the adenylate energy charge and phosphorylcreatine mole fraction were determined in the adriamycin - treated cells.	[]
The adenylate energy charge was found to be significantly decreased, while the phophorylcreatine mole fraction was unchanged.	[]
Such disparity suggests an inhibition of creatine phosphokinase.	[]
The addition of 1 mM adenosine to the myocardial cell cultures markedly increases the ATP concentration through a pathway reportedly leading to a compartmentalized ATP pool.	[]
In the adriamycin - treated cells, the addition of adenosine increased the adenylate charge and, concomitant with this inrcease, the cells ' functional integrity, in terms of percentage of beating cells and rate of contractions, was maintained.	[]

Amiloride reduced the drinking and urine volume of rats in an acute ( 6 or 12 h) and a subacute ( 3 days) experiment.	[]
6 h after the administration of amiloride, a reduction was observed in the lithium content of the renal medulla but not in the other organs studied.	[]
At 12 h, all the tissues showed a slight increase in lithium levels.	[]
After 3 days of combined treatment, a marked elevation in plasma and tissue lithium levels accompanied a reduction in water intake.	[]
In all the experiments, the attenuation of the lithium - induced diabetes - insipidus - like syndrome by amiloride was accompanied by a reduction of the ratio between the lithium concentration in the renal medulla and its levels in the blood and an elevation in the plasma potassium level.

Interactive effects of variations in [ Na] o and [ Ca] o on rat atrial spontaneous frequency.	[]
The effects of varying the extracellular concentrations of Na and Ca ( [ Na] o and [ Ca] o) on both, the spontaneous beating and the negative chronotropic action of verapamil, were studied in the isolated rat atria.	[]
Basal frequency ( BF) evaluated by surface electrogram was 223 + / - 4 beats / min. in control Krebs - Ringer containing 137 mM Na and 1. 35 mM Ca ( N).	[]
It decreased by 16 + / - 3% by lowering [ Na] o to 78 mM ( LNa), 23 + / - 2% by lowering simultaneously [ Na] o to 78 mM and [ Ca] o to 0. 675 mM ( LNa + LCa) and 31 + / - 5% by lowering [ Na] o to 78 mM plus increasing [ Ca] o to 3. 6 mM ( LNa + HCa).	[]
At normal [ Na] o, decrease ( 0. 675 mM) or increase ( 3. 6 mM) of [ Ca] o did not modify BF; a reduction of ten times ( 0. 135 mM of normal [ Ca] o was effective to reduce BF by 40 + / - 13%.	[]
All negative chronotropic effects were BF - dependent.	[]
Dose - dependent bradycardia induced by verapamil was potentiated by LNa, LCa, and HCa.	"bradycardia	17	28	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""bradycardia"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Independent but not additive effects of Na and Ca are shown by decreases in the values of [ verapamil] o needed to reduce BF by 30% ( IC30) with the following order of inhibitory potency: LNa > LCa > HCa > N, resulting LNa + HCa similar to LNa.	[]
The [ verapamil] o that arrested atrial beating ( AC) was also potentiated with the order LNa = LNa + LCa = LNa + HCa = LCa > HCa = N.	[]
The results indicate that rat atrial spontaneous beating is more dependent on [ Na] o than on [ Ca] o in a range of + / - 50% of their normal concentration.	[]
Also the enhancement of verapamil effects on atrial beating was more pronounced at LNa than at LCa. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	[]

The purpose of our study was to determine the cause of the patients ' reactions, the immunological mechanisms involved and whether these patients would be able to tolerate any kind of corticoid.	[]
Clinical examinations and skin, oral and parenteral challenges with different corticosteroids and ELISA tests were performed.	[]
In the two patients, skin and ELISA tests with paramethasone were negative, as was the prick test with each of its excipients.	[]
A single - blind parenteral challenge with Triniol was positive in both patients after the administration of 1 ml of the drug, and negative with its excipients.	[]
We also carried out oral and parenteral challenges with other corticosteroids and found intolerance to some of them.	[]
These results suggest that paramethasone caused pseudoallergic reactions in our patients.	[]

Chemical analysis of gall stones retrieved at cholecystectomy from two patients, showed that they contained 71% and 87% cholesterol by weight.	"gall stones	21	32	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""gall stones"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In the remaining 12 patients, localised computed tomography of the gall bladder showed that eight had stones with maximum attenuation scores of < 100 Hounsfield units ( values of < 100 HU predict cholesterol rich, dissolvable stones).	[]
Gall bladder bile was obtained by ultrasound guided, fine needle puncture from six patients.	[]
All six patients had supersaturated bile ( mean ( SEM) cholesterol saturation index of 1. 19 ( 0. 08) ( range 1. 01 - 1. 53)) and all had abnormally rapid cholesterol microcrystal nucleation times ( < 4 days ( range 1 - 4)), whilst in four, the bile contained cholesterol microcrystals immediately after sampling.	[]
Of the 12 patients considered for oral ursodeoxycholic acid ( UDCA) treatment, two had a blocked cystic duct and were not started on UDCA while one was lost to follow up.	[]
After one year of treatment, five of the remaining nine patients showed either partial ( n = 3) or complete ( n = 2) gall stone dissolution, suggesting that their stones were cholesterol rich.	"gall stone	117	127	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""gall stone"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

The present study was undertaken to examine the role of sleep disturbance, induced by clomipramine administration, on the secretory rate of prolactin ( PRL) in addition to the direct drug effect.	"sleep disturbance	56	73	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""sleep disturbance"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Two groups of supine subjects were studied under placebo - controlled conditions, one during the night, when sleeping ( n = 7) and the other at daytime, when awake ( n = 6).	[]
Each subject received a single 50 mg dose of clomipramine given orally 2 hours before blood collection.	[]
Plasma PRL concentrations were analysed at 10 min intervals and underlying secretory rates calculated by a deconvolution procedure.	[]
For both experiments the drug intake led to significant increases in PRL secretion, acting preferentially on tonic secretion as pulse amplitude and frequency did not differ significantly from corresponding control values.	[]
During the night clomipramine ingestion altered the complete sleep architecture in that it suppressed REM sleep and the sleep cycles and induced increased wakefulness.	[]
As the relative increase in PRL secretion expressed as a percentage of the mean did not significantly differ between the night and day time studies ( 46 + / - 19% vs 34 + / - 10%), it can be concluded that the observed sleep disturbance did not interfere with the drug action per se.	"sleep disturbance	219	236	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""sleep disturbance"", ""start_span"": 219, ""end_span"": 236, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The presence of REM sleep was shown not to be a determining factor either for secretory pulse amplitude and frequency, as, for both, mean nocturnal values were similar with and without prior clomipramine ingestion.	[]
Survey of complications of indocyanine green angiography in Japan.	[]
PURPOSE: We evaluated the safety of indocyanine green for use in fundus angiography.	[]
METHODS: We sent a questionnaire concerning complications of indocyanine green to 32 institutions in Japan, which were selected on the basis of the client list from the Topcon Company, which manufactures the indocyanine green fundus camera.	[]
RESULTS: Ophthalmologists at 15 institutions responded, reporting a total of 3, 774 indocyanine green angiograms performed on 2, 820 patients between June 1984 and September 1992.	[]
Before angiography, intradermal or intravenous indocyanine green testing, or both was performed at 13 of 15 institutions.	[]
For three patients, the decision was made not to proceed with angiography after positive preangiographic testing.	[]
The dosage of indocyanine green used for angiography varied from 25 to 75 mg, depending upon the institution.	[]
There were 13 cases of adverse reactions ( 0. 34%), ten of which were mild reactions such as nausea, exanthema, urtication, itchiness, and urgency to defecate, and did not require treatment.

Six epidemiologic studies in the United States and Europe indicate that habitual use of phenacetin is associated with the development of chronic renal failure and end - stage renal disease ( ESRD), with a relative risk in the range of 4 to 19.	"chronic renal failure	137	158	Disease/Disorder"	"end - stage renal disease	163	188	Disease/Disorder"	"ESRD	191	195	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""chronic renal failure"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""end - stage renal disease"", ""start_span"": 163, ""end_span"": 188, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""ESRD"", ""start_span"": 191, ""end_span"": 195, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
As a result of these and other studies, phenacetin has now been withdrawn from the market in most countries.	[]
However, three case control studies, one each in North Carolina, northern Maryland, and West Berlin, Germany, showed that habitual use of acetaminophen is also associated with chronic renal failure and ESRD, with a relative risk in the range of 2 to 4.	"chronic renal failure	176	197	Disease/Disorder"	"ESRD	202	206	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""chronic renal failure"", ""start_span"": 176, ""end_span"": 197, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""ESRD"", ""start_span"": 202, ""end_span"": 206, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
These studies suggest that both phenacetin and acetaminophen may contribute to the burden of ESRD, with the risk of the latter being somewhat less than that of the former.	"ESRD	93	97	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ESRD"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
This apparent difference in risk may not be due to differences in nephrotoxic potential of the drugs themselves.	"nephrotoxic	66	77	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""nephrotoxic"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
A lower relative risk would be expected for acetaminophen if the risk of both drugs in combination with other analgesics was higher than the risk of either agent alone.	[]
Thus, acetaminophen has been used both as a single agent and in combination with other analgesics, whereas phenacetin was available only in combinations.	[]
The possibility that habitual use of acetaminophen alone increases the risk of ESRD has not been clearly demonstrated, but cannot be dismissed.	"ESRD	79	83	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ESRD"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

At the same time, the number of heparan sulphate anionic sites and the total anionic site surface ( number of anionic sites x mean anionic site surface) in the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane was reduced by 19% ( p < 0. 021) and by 26% ( p < 0. 02), respectively.	[]
Number and total anionic site surface in the remaining part of the glomerular basement membrane ( lamina densa and lamina rara interna) were not significantly changed.	[]

Effect of nifedipine on renal function in liver transplant recipients receiving tacrolimus.	[]
The effect of nifedipine on renal function in liver transplant recipients who were receiving tacrolimus was evaluated between January 1992 and January 1996.	[]
Two groups of patients receiving tacrolimus were compared over a period of 1 year, one group comprising hypertensive patients who were receiving nifedipine, and the other comprising nonhypertensive patients not receiving nifedipine.

Five females and 6 males, 21 - 59 years of age, were examined with a 1. 5 - T whole - body system using a circular polarized head coil.	[]
Conventional spin echo images were acquired in the sagittal and transverse orientation.	[]
In addition, we performed a high - resolution 3D gradient echo, T1 - weighted sequences at a 1 - mm slice thickness.	[]
The images were subsequently processed to obtain volumetric data for the cerebellum.	[]
Cerebellar volume for the patient group ranged between 67. 66 and 131. 08 ml ( mean 108. 9 ml).	[]
In addition 3D gradient echo data sets from 10 healthy male and 10 healthy female age - matched volunteers were used to compare cerebellar volumes.	[]
Using linear regression we found that no correlation exists between seizure duration, elevation of phenytoin serum levels and cerebellar volume.	"seizure	68	75	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""seizure"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
However, multiple regression for the daily dosage, duration of phenytoin treatment and cerebellar volume revealed a correlation of these parameters.	[]
We conclude that phenytoin overdosage does not necessarily result in cerebellar atrophy and it is unlikely that phenytoin medication was the only cause of cerebellar atrophy in the remaining patients.

After the ingestion of 26 venlafaxine 50 - mg tablets, the patient experienced a witnessed generalized seizure.	"seizure	103	110	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""seizure"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit, venlafaxine was discontinued, and no further sequelae were seen.	[]
DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of venlafaxine overdose that resulted in a generalized seizure.

Measurements included arterial ketone body ratio ( AKBR, aceto - acetate / 3 - hydroxybutyrate) and clinical hepatic function parameters.	[]
AKBR and biological hepatic function tests showed no change throughout the time course in groups A and B.	[]
In group C, AKBR showed a significant decrease at 120 min ( - 40%) and at 180 min ( - 49%) after the start of hypotension and at 60 min ( - 32%) after recovery of normotension, and SGOT, SGPT, LDH and total bilirubin showed significant increases after operation.

Clinical studies of pipe smokers and people using transdermal nicotine support the idea that toxins other than nicotine are the most important causes of acute cardiovascular events.	[]
Finally, the dose response for cardiovascular events of nicotine appears to be flat, suggesting that if nicotine is involved, adverse effects might be seen with relatively low - level cigarette exposures.	[]

All nine exposed workers were affected to various degrees.	[]
Both compounds are metabolised in the same way as 1 - bromo - 1 - chloro - 2, 2, 2 - trifluoroethane ( halothane) to form reactive trifluoroacetyl halide intermediates, which have been implicated in the hepatotoxicity of halothane.

Most of the other low testosterone levels seemed to result from nonorganic hypothalamic dysfunction because of normal serum luteinizing hormone and prolactin and to have only a small role in erectile dysfunction ( definite improvement in only 16 of 44 [ 36%] after androgen therapy, normal morning or nocturnal erections in 30% and definite vasculogenic contributions in 42%).

Bromocriptine was definitely effective in cases with prolactin greater than 35 ng. / ml.	[]
( 8 of 12 compared to only 9 of 22 cases with prolactin between 20 and 35 ng. / ml.).	[]
Testosterone was low in less than 50% of cases with prolactin greater than 35 ng. / ml.	[]

To determine if routine risperidone treatment is associated with a unique degree of D2 receptor occupancy and pattern of clinical effects, we used [ 123I] IBZM SPECT to determine D2 occupancy in subjects treated with routine clinical doses of risperidone ( n = 12) or haloperidol ( n = 7).	[]
Both risperidone and haloperidol produced D2 occupancy levels between approximately 60 and 90% at standard clinical doses.	[]
There was no significant difference between occupancy levels obtained with haloperidol or risperidone.	[]
Drug - induced parkinsonism was observed in subjects treated with risperidone ( 42%) and haloperidol ( 29%) and was observed at occupancy levels above 60%.

Based on these observations, it is concluded that 5 - HT2 blockade obtained with risperidone at D2 occupancy rates of 60% and above does not appear to protect against the risk for extrapyramidal side effects.	[]

Antinociceptive and antiamnesic properties of the presynaptic cholinergic amplifier PG - 9.	[]
The antinociceptive effect of 3 alpha - tropyl 2 - ( p - bromophenyl) propionate [ ( + / -) - PG - 9] ( 10 - 40 mg kg - 1 s. c.; 30 - 60 mg kg - 1 p. o.; 10 - 30 mg kg - 1 i. v.; 10 - 30 micrograms / mouse i. c. v.) was examined in mice, rats and guinea pigs by use of the hot - plate, abdominal - constriction, tail - flick and paw - pressure tests.	[]
( + / -) - PG - 9 antinociception peaked 15 min after injection and then slowly diminished.	[]
The antinociception produced by ( + / -) - PG - 9 was prevented by the unselective muscarinic antagonist atropine, the M1 - selective antagonists pirenzepine and dicyclomine and the acetylcholine depletor hemicholinium - 3, but not by the opioid antagonist naloxone, the gamma - aminobutyric acidB antagonist 3 - aminopropyl - diethoxy - methyl - phosphinic acid, the H3 agonist R - ( alpha) - methylhistamine, the D2 antagonist quinpirole, the 5 - hydroxytryptamine4 antagonist 2 - methoxy - 4 - amino - 5 - chlorobenzoic acid 2 - ( diethylamino) ethyl ester hydrochloride, the 5 - hydroxytryptamin1A antagonist 1 - ( 2 - methoxyphenyl) - 4 - [ 4 - ( 2 - phthalimido) butyl] piperazine hydrobromide and the polyamines depletor reserpine.	[]
Based on these data, it can be postulated that ( + / -) - PG - 9 exerted an antinociceptive effect mediated by a central potentiation of cholinergic transmission.	[]
( + / -) - PG - 9 ( 10 - 40 mg kg - 1 i. p.) was able to prevent amnesia induced by scopolamine ( 1 mg kg - 1 i. p.) and dicyclomine ( 2 mg kg - 1 i. p.) in the mouse passive - avoidance test.

Prospective multicentre studies with a large population and a long follow - up should be performed in order to evaluate the incidence of this unusual side effect.	[]
However, we suggest that a low solution concentration should be preferred for unilateral spinal anaesthesia with a hyperbaric anaesthetic solution ( if pencil - point needle and slow injection rate are employed), in order to minimize the risk of a localized high peak anaesthetic concentration, which might lead to a transient neurological deficit.

"Transient neurologic symptoms	0	29	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Transient neurologic symptoms"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that transient neurologic symptoms ( TNSs) frequently follow lidocaine spinal anesthesia but are infrequent with bupivacaine.	"transient neurologic symptoms	42	71	Disease/Disorder"	"TNSs	74	78	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""transient neurologic symptoms"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""TNSs"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
However, identification of a short - acting local anesthetic to substitute for lidocaine for brief surgical procedures remains an important goal.	[]
Prilocaine is an amide local anesthetic with a duration of action similar to that of lidocaine.	[]
Accordingly, the present, prospective double - blind study compares prilocaine with lidocaine and bupivacaine with respect to duration of action and relative risk of TNSs.	"TNSs	166	170	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""TNSs"", ""start_span"": 166, ""end_span"": 170, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
METHODS: Ninety patients classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II who were scheduled for short gynecologic procedures under spinal anesthesia were randomly allocated to receive 2. 5 ml 2% lidocaine in 7. 5% glucose, 2% prilocaine in 7. 5% glucose, or 0. 5% bupivacaine in 7. 5% glucose.	[]
All solutions were provided in blinded vials by the hospital pharmacy.	[]
Details of spinal puncture, extension and regression of spinal block, and the times to reach discharge criteria were noted.	[]
In the evening of postoperative day 1, patients were evaluated for TNSs by a physician unaware of the drug administered and the details of the anesthetic procedure.	"TNSs	67	71	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""TNSs"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
RESULTS: Nine of 30 patients receiving lidocaine experienced TNSs, 1 of 30 patients receiving prilocaine ( P = 0. 03) had them, and none of 30 patients receiving bupivacaine had TNSs.	"TNSs	61	65	Disease/Disorder"	"TNSs	61	65	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""TNSs"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""TNSs"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Times to ambulate and to void were similar after lidocaine and prilocaine ( 150 vs. 165 min and 238 vs. 253 min, respectively) but prolonged after bupivacaine ( 200 and 299 min, respectively; P < 0. 05).	[]
CONCLUSIONS: Prilocaine may be preferable to lidocaine for short surgical procedures because it has a similar duration of action but a lower incidence of TNSs.	"TNSs	154	158	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""TNSs"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Repeated trimipramine induces dopamine D2 / D3 and alpha1 - adrenergic up - regulation.	[]
Trimipramine ( TRI), which shows a clinical antidepressant activity, is chemically related to imipramine but does not inhibit the reuptake of noradrenaline and 5 - hydroxytryptamine, nor does it induce beta - adrenergic down - regulation.	[]
The mechanism of its antidepressant activity is still unknown.	[]
The aim of the present study was to find out whether TRI given repeatedly was able to induce adaptive changes in the dopaminergic and alpha1 - adrenergic systems, demonstrated by us previously for various antidepressants.	[]
TRI was given to male Wistar rats and male Albino Swiss mice perorally twice daily for 14 days.	[]
In the acute experiment TRI ( given i. p.) does not antagonize the reserpine hypothermia in mice and does not potentiate the 5 - hydroxytryptophan head twitches in rats.

It increases the behaviour stimulation evoked by phenylephrine ( given intraventricularly) in rats, evaluated in the open field test as well as the aggressiveness evoked by clonidine in mice, both these effects being mediated by an alpha1 - adrenergic receptor.

It may be concluded that, like other tricyclic antidepressants studied previously, TRI given repeatedly increases the responsiveness of brain dopamine D2 and D3 ( locomotor activity but not stereotypy) as well as alpha1 - adrenergic receptors to their agonists.	[]
A question arises whether the reuptake inhibition is of any importance to the adaptive changes induced by repeated antidepressants, suggested to be responsible for the antidepressant activity.	[]

An unusual toxic reaction to axillary block by mepivacaine with adrenaline.	[]
An increase in blood pressure, accompanied by atrial fibrillation, agitation, incomprehensible shouts and loss of consciousness, was observed in an elderly, ASA classification group II, cardiovascularly medicated male, 12 min after performance of axillary block with mepivacaine 850 mg containing adrenaline 0. 225 mg, for correction of Dupuytren ' s contracture.

Adverse effects of the atypical antipsychotics.	[]
Collaborative Working Group on Clinical Trial Evaluations.	[]
Adverse effects of antipsychotics often lead to noncompliance.	[]
Thus, clinicians should address patients ' concerns about adverse effects and attempt to choose medications that will improve their patients ' quality of life as well as overall health.	[]
The side effect profiles of the atypical antipsychotics are more advantageous than those of the conventional neuroleptics.	[]
Conventional agents are associated with unwanted central nervous system effects, including extrapyramidal symptoms ( EPS), tardive dyskinesia, sedation, and possible impairment of some cognitive measures, as well as cardiac effects, orthostatic hypotension, hepatic changes, anticholinergic side effects, sexual dysfunction, and weight gain.

The newer atypical agents have a lower risk of EPS, but are associated in varying degrees with sedation, cardiovascular effects, anticholinergic effects, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, hepatic effects, lowered seizure threshold ( primarily clozapine), and agranulocytosis ( clozapine only).

METHOD: In a 6 - week random - assignment, double - blind, placebo - controlled trial ( phase A), haloperidol, 2 - 3 mg / day ( standard dose), and haloperidol, 0. 50 - 0. 75 mg / day ( low dose), were compared in 71 outpatients with Alzheimer ' s disease.

For the subsequent 6 - week double - blind crossover phase ( phase B), patients taking standard - or low - dose haloperidol were switched to placebo, and patients taking placebo were randomly assigned to standard - or low - dose haloperidol.	[]
RESULTS: For the 60 patients who completed phase A, standard - dose haloperidol was efficacious and superior to both low - dose haloperidol and placebo for scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale psychosis factor and on psychomotor agitation.

Response rates according to three sets of criteria were greater with the standard dose ( 55% - 60%) than the low dose ( 25% - 35%) and placebo ( 25% - 30%).	[]
The advantage of standard dose over low dose was replicated in phase B.	[]
In phase A, extrapyramidal signs tended to be greater with the standard dose than in the other two conditions, primarily because of a subgroup ( 20%) who developed moderate to severe signs.	"extrapyramidal signs	12	32	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""extrapyramidal signs"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Low - dose haloperidol did not differ from placebo on any measure of efficacy or side effects.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated a favorable therapeutic profile for haloperidol in doses of 2 - 3 mg / day, although a subgroup developed moderate to severe extrapyramidal signs.	"extrapyramidal signs	160	180	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""extrapyramidal signs"", ""start_span"": 160, ""end_span"": 180, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
A starting dose of 1 mg / day with gradual, upward dose titration is recommended.	[]

Infusions of epinephrine ( 4 mug per kilogram per minute for 6 hours) increased radiocalcium uptakes into intact myocardium and each of its subcellular components with the mitochondrial fraction showing the most consistent changes when compared to saline - infused control animals ( 4, 957 vs. 827 counts per minute per gram of dried tissue or fraction).	[]
Myocardial concentrations of calcium also increased significantly ( 12. 0 vs. 5. 0 mg. per 100 Gm. of fat - free dry weight).	[]
Infusions of calcium chloride sufficient to raise serum calcium concentrations 2 mEq. per liter failed to increase calcium influx into the myocardial cell.	[]
Mitochondrial radiocalcium uptakes were significantly decreased in animals pretreated with acetylsalicylic acid or dipyridamole or when hydrocortisone was added to the epinephrine infusion ( 2, 682, 2, 803, and 3, 424 counts per minute per gram of dried fraction, respectively).	[]
Myocardial calcium concentrations also were decreased ( 11. 2, 8. 3, and 8. 9 mg. per 100 Gm. of fat - free dry weight, respectively) in the three treatment groups, being significantly decreased only in the last two.	[]
Evidence of microscopic damage was graded as less severe in the three treatment groups.	[]
Acetylsalicylic acid, dipyridamole, and hydrocortisone all appear to have cardioprotective effects when tested in this model.	[]
Clinical and histopathologic examination of renal allografts treated with tacrolimus ( FK506) for at least one year.	[]
BACKGROUND: We clinically and pathologically analyzed renal allografts from 1 9 renal transplant patients treated with tacrolimus ( FK506) for more than 1 year.	[]
METHODS: Twenty - six renal allograft biopsy specimens from 1 9 renal transplant patients who underwent transplantations between 1991 and 1993 were evaluated.	[]
Thirteen biopsies were performed from stable functioning renal allografts with informed consent ( nonepisode biopsy) and the other 13 were from dysfunctional renal allografts with a clinical indication for biopsy ( episode biopsy).	[]
RESULTS: The main pathologic diagnoses ( some overlap) were acute rejection ( AR; n = 4), chronic rejection ( CR; n = 5), AR + CR ( n = 4), recurrent IgA nephropathy ( n = 5), normal findings ( n = 2), minimal - type chronic FK506 nephropathy ( n = 9), and mild - type FK506 nephropathy ( n = 11).

Hepatocyte tight junctions ( TJs), the only intercellular barrier between the sinusoidal and the canalicular spaces, play a key role in bile formation.	[]
Although hepatocyte TJs are impaired in cholestasis, attempts to localize the precise site of hepatocyte TJ damage by freeze - fracture electron microscopy have produced limited information.

Recently, several TJ - associated proteins like ZO - 1 and 7H6 have been identified and characterized.	[]
Immunolocalization of 7H6 appears to closely correlate with paracellular permeability.	[]
We used rat models of intrahepatic cholestasis by ethinyl estradiol ( EE) treatment and extrahepatic cholestasis by bile duct ligation ( BDL) to precisely determine the site of TJ damage.

Alterations in hepatocyte TJs were assessed by double - immunolabeling for 7H6 and ZO - 1 using a confocal laser scanning microscope.	[]
In control rats, immunostaining for 7H6 and ZO - 1 colocalized to outline bile canaliculi in a continuous fashion.	[]
In contrast, 7H6 and ZO - 1 immunostaining was more discontinuous, outlining the bile canaliculi after BDL.	[]
Immunostaining for 7H6, not ZO - 1, decreased and predominantly appeared as discrete signals in the submembranous cytoplasm of periportal hepatocytes after BDL.	[]
After EE treatment, changes in immunostaining for 7H6 and ZO - 1 were similar to those seen in periportal hepatocytes after BDL, but distributed more diffusely throughout the lobule.	[]
This study is the first to demonstrate that impairment of hepatocyte TJs occurs heterogenously in the liver lobule after BDL and suggests that BDL and EE treatments produce different lobular distributions of increased paracellular permeability.	[]

The effects of PG - 9 ( 3alpha - tropyl 2 - ( p - bromophenyl) propionate), the acetylcholine releaser, on memory processes and nerve growth factor ( NGF) synthesis were evaluated.	[]
In the mouse passive - avoidance test, PG - 9 ( 10 - 30 mg / kg, i. p.), administered 20 min before the training session, prevented amnesia induced by both the non selective antimuscarinic drug scopolamine and the M1 - selective antagonist S - ( -) - ET - 126.

"amnesia	130	137	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""amnesia"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
At the highest effective doses, PG - 9 did not produce any collateral symptoms as revealed by the Irwin test, and it did not modify spontaneous motility and inspection activity, as revealed by the hole - board test.	[]
PG - 9 was also able to increase the amount of NGF secreted in vitro by astrocytes in a dose - dependent manner.	[]
The maximal NGF contents obtained by PG - 9 were 17. 6 - fold of the control value.	[]
During culture, no morphological changes were found at effective concentrations of PG - 9.	[]
The current work indicates the ability of PG - 9 to induce beneficial effects on cognitive processes and stimulate activity of NGF synthesis in astroglial cells.	[]
Therefore, PG - 9 could represent a potential useful drug able to improve the function of impaired cognitive processes.	[]
Mechanisms of FK 506 - induced hypertension in the rat.	"hypertension	31	43	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hypertension"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
- Tacrolimus ( FK 506) is a powerful, widely used immunosuppressant.	[]
The clinical utility of FK 506 is complicated by substantial hypertension and nephrotoxicity.	"hypertension	61	73	Disease/Disorder"	"nephrotoxicity	78	92	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hypertension"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""nephrotoxicity"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
To clarify the mechanisms of FK 506 - induced hypertension, we studied the chronic effects of FK 506 on the synthesis of endothelin - 1 ( ET - 1), the expression of mRNA of ET - 1 and endothelin - converting enzyme - 1 ( ECE - 1), the endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS) activity, and the expression of mRNA of eNOS and C - type natriuretic peptide ( CNP) in rat blood vessels.

In addition, the effect of the specific endothelin type A receptor antagonist FR 139317 on FK 506 - induced hypertension in rats was studied.	"hypertension	108	120	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hypertension"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
FK 506, 5 mg.	[]
kg - 1.	[]
d - 1 given for 4 weeks, elevated blood pressure from 102 + / - 13 to 152 + / - 15 mm Hg and increased the synthesis of ET - 1 and the levels of ET - 1 mRNA in the mesenteric artery ( 240% and 230%, respectively).	[]
Little change was observed in the expression of ECE - 1 mRNA and CNP mRNA.	[]
FK 506 decreased eNOS activity and the levels of eNOS mRNA in the aorta ( 48% and 55%, respectively).	[]
The administration of FR 139317 ( 10 mg. kg - 1. d - 1) prevented FK 506 - induced hypertension in rats.	"hypertension	83	95	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hypertension"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
These results indicate that FK 506 may increase blood pressure not only by increasing ET - 1 production but also by decreasing NO synthesis in the vasculature.	[]
