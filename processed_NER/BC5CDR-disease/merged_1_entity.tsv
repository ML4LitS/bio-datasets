The stage of olig - anuria lasted for 1 - 3 weeks, and five of the patients were treated by hemodialysis.	anuria,20,26,Disease/Disorder	"[{""token"": ""anuria"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"	train

Chronic effects of a novel synthetic anthracycline derivative ( SM - 5887) on normal heart and doxorubicin - induced cardiomyopathy in beagle dogs.	cardiomyopathy,117,131,Disease/Disorder	"[{""token"": ""cardiomyopathy"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"	train
Animals which received over six courses of doxorubicin demonstrated the electrocardiogram ( ECG) changes, decrease of blood pressure and high - grade histopathological cardiomyopathy, while animals which were terminally sacrificed after the SM - 5887 administration did not show any changes in ECG, blood pressure and histopathological examinations.	cardiomyopathy,168,182,Disease/Disorder	"[{""token"": ""cardiomyopathy"", ""start_span"": 168, ""end_span"": 182, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"	train
The low - grade cardiotoxic changes were enhanced by the additional doxorubicin treatment.	cardiotoxic,16,27,Disease/Disorder	"[{""token"": ""cardiotoxic"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"	train

BACKGROUND: Because uncontrolled echocardiographic surveys suggested that up to 30% to 38% of users of fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine had valvular disease, these drugs were withdrawn from the market.	valvular disease,140,156,Disease/Disorder	"[{""token"": ""valvular disease"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"	train
OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk for new or worsening valvular abnormalities among users of fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine who underwent echocardiography before they began to take these medications.	valvular abnormalities,54,76,Disease/Disorder	"[{""token"": ""valvular abnormalities"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"	train
RESULTS: Two patients ( 4. 3% [ 95% CI, 0. 6% to 14. 8%]) receiving fenfluramine - phentermine developed valvular heart disease.	valvular heart disease,105,127,Disease/Disorder	"[{""token"": ""valvular heart disease"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"	train

In the present study, the possible enhancement by isoniazid of bradycardia induced by beta - adrenoceptor antagonists was determined in rats anaesthetised with chloralose - urethane.	bradycardia,63,74,Disease/Disorder	"[{""token"": ""bradycardia"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"	train
Isoniazid significantly increased bradycardia after propranolol, pindolol, labetalol and atenolol, as well as after clonidine, but not after hexamethonium or carbachol.	bradycardia,34,45,Disease/Disorder	"[{""token"": ""bradycardia"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"	train
