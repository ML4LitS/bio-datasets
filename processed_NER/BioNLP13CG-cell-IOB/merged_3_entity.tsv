The organism prevents malignant transformation by assuring accurate DNA repair before cell division, by forcing the death of cells with excessive DNA damage, and by placing limits on the replicative lifespans of most somatic cells.	cell,86,90,Cell	cells,125,130,Cell	somatic cells,217,230,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""somatic cells"", ""start_span"": 217, ""end_span"": 230, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
We utilized two autologous human melanoma cell lines, IV Cl 1 and IV Cl 3, which displayed qualitatively different metastatic phenotypes following subdermal inoculation into nude mice.	melanoma cell lines,33,52,Cell	IV Cl 1,54,61,Cell	IV Cl 3,66,73,Cell	"[{""token"": ""melanoma cell lines"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""IV Cl 1"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""IV Cl 3"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
Interestingly, crossing of cyclin D1 transgenic mice with E mu L - myc transgenics that express their transgene in both B - and T - cells but predominantly develop T - cell tumours leads in double transgenics exclusively to B - cell neoplasia.

The results demonstrated that levels of the c - jun mRNA and protein were unchanged in the revertants when compared to the transformed parental cells, and ectopic overexpression of c - jun failed to retransform the revertants.	revertants,91,101,Cell	cells,144,149,Cell	revertants,215,225,Cell	"[{""token"": ""revertants"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""revertants"", ""start_span"": 215, ""end_span"": 225, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
After successive growth in vitro for longer than one month which was scarcely observed with the erythrophores, the vast majority of such transformants began to differentiate into erythrophores and ceased proliferation spontaneously.	erythrophores,96,109,Cell	transformants,137,150,Cell	erythrophores,179,192,Cell	"[{""token"": ""erythrophores"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""transformants"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""erythrophores"", ""start_span"": 179, ""end_span"": 192, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
One cell line ( ESM - 1) derived from the erythrophores transfected with src / myc grew successively over nine months, indicating its acquisition of immortality.	cell line,4,13,Cell	ESM - 1,16,23,Cell	erythrophores,42,55,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cell line"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""ESM - 1"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""erythrophores"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
