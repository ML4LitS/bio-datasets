Herein, we report that these compounds effectively inhibited SDF - 1 - induced migration of human breast cancer cells ( MDA - MB - 231), human leukemia T cells ( Sup - T1) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells at concentrations of 10 - 100 nM in vitro.

In comparison with nonmetastasis Hep3B cell lines, there were 16 proteins overexpressed in MHCC97H and MHCC97L, 10 proteins underexpressed in MHCC97H and MHCC97L.

Here, we discuss the possibility for MMPs to contribute to pericyte recruitment at six levels: ( 1) direct promotion of pericyte invasion by extracellular matrix degradation; ( 2) stimulation of pericyte proliferation and protection against apoptosis by modification of the ECM; ( 3) activation of pericytes through the release of growth factor bound to the ECM; ( 4) transactivation of angiogenic cell surface receptor; ( 5) propagation of angiogenic signalling as cofactor; and ( 6) recruitment of bone marrow - derived stem cells.

In this work, we show that LPA stimulates invasion of primary ovarian cancer cells, but not ovarian epithelial or borderline ovarian tumor cells, although these benign cells indeed respond to LPA in cell migration.

The apparent mesenchymal to epithelial conversion of the tumor cells mimics the conversion that occurs during embryonic kidney development, suggesting that Met - HGF / SF signaling plays a role in this process as well as in tumors that express both epithelial and mesenchymal markers.
