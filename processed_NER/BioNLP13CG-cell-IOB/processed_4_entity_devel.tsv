Hck - mediated cellular transformation of murine fibroblasts is reverted by ectopic expression of a membrane - anchored allele of Cbl as assessed by the cellular morphology, suppression of anchorage independent growth, and an overall reduction in the total tyrosine phosphorylation levels within the cells.

Single cell transplants showed that a common precursor contributes to both the hemopoietic and endothelial lineages, thus demonstrating the presence of an adult hemangioblast.

By ruling out cell fusion, we clearly demonstrate the existence of an adult hemangioblast, but the differentiation of marrow stem cells toward the endothelial lineage is an extremely rare event.

We defined the role of c - Myc in cancer cell sensitivity to vinblastine ( VLB) using human colon cancer cells: LoVo wild - type or transfected with a plasmid containing the human c - myc gene in antisense orientation ( LoVo - mycANS).

Syndecan - 1 is a cell surface proteoglycan that has been implicated in a number of cellular functions including cell - cell adhesion, cell - matrix anchorage and growth factor presentation for signalling receptors.

In order to better understand the coordinated regulation of cell - cell and cell - matrix interactions during malignant transformation, we have studied the expression of syndecan - 1 in malignant mammary tumor cells genetically manipulated for E - cadherin expression.

Metastasis - associated 5T4 antigen disrupts cell - cell contacts and induces cellular motility in epithelial cells.

In transfected MDCK canine kidney epithelial cells, 5T4 over - expression also results in increased motility, but disruption of cell - cell contacts, either by culturing cells in low calcium medium or by addition of HGF / SF, is needed.

The in vitro expression of FAK and its level of phosphorylation appear to be related to several physiological phenomena, including cell spreading, cell differentiation, cell locomotion and cell death.
