From these data, as well as earlier evidence demonstrating that the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( NADH) shuttle in these cells requires a transaminase step and is thus identified as the malate - aspartate shuttle ( W.

A significantly reduced expression of SEMA3B ( 83 kDa), SEMA3F ( 90 kDa), and plexin - A3 was observed in ovarian cancer cell lines when compared with normal human ovarian surface epithelial cells.

A key factor in the response of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs is the activation of the apoptotic pathway, a pathway that is often impaired in chemoresistant colon cancer cells.

In contrast, continuous ( 24h) treatment with doxorubicin reduced the number of living cells with no parallel raise in the amount of dead cells.

These results suggest that doxorubicin is able to induce cell death by apoptosis only at particular dose and treatment conditions and imply a completely different cellular response following bolus or continuous exposure to doxorubicin.

Unlike the majority of somatic cells, in which hTERT and telomerase activity are generally silent, normal lymphocytes show transient physiological hTERT expression and telomerase activity according to their differentiation / activation status.

Available data indicate that the timing of telomerase activation may allow the distinction of two different lymphomagenetic models: ( i) an early activation of telomerase via exogenous regulators of hTERT, along with an increased lymphocyte growth and a subsequent selection of cells with increased transforming potential may characterize several virus - related lymphoid malignancies; ( ii) a progressive shortening of telomeres, leading to genetic instability which favors a subsequent activation of telomerase via endogenous regulators may occur in most virus - unrelated lymphoid tumors.

Induction of FOXO3a activity in doxorubicin - sensitive MCF - 7 cells was sufficient to promote Akt phosphorylation and arrest cell proliferation.

However FOXO3a induction has little effect on cell proliferation, indicating that FOXO3a or its downstream activity is deregulated in the cytotoxic drug resistant breast cancer cells.

In these breast cancers activated Akt fails to inactivate and re - localize FOXO3a to the cytoplasm, and nuclear - targeted FOXO3a does not induce cell death or cell cycle arrest.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: U - 995 was designed to study human umbilical vein endothelial cell ( HUVEC) migration and proliferation in vitro and angiogenesis induced by TNF alpha in chicken chorioallantoic membrane ( CAM).

In addition, when 200 micrograms U - 995 was injected i. p. into mice it suppressed sarcoma - 180 cell growth and B16 - F10 mouse melanoma cell metastasis in vivo.
