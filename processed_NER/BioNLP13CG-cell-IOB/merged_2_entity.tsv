Vaccination is associated with enhancement of splenocyte - mediated tumoricidal activity, whereas the effect of gammaIFN is mediated by KC.	splenocyte,46,56,Cell	KC,136,138,Cell	"[{""token"": ""splenocyte"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""KC"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
Combination therapy targets both lymphocytes and macrophages, and is more effective in reducing tumor than either therapy alone.	lymphocytes,33,44,Cell	macrophages,49,60,Cell	"[{""token"": ""lymphocytes"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
Though less efficient in energy production, it ensures continuous supply of energy and phosphometabolites for biosynthesis enabling metastatic and less vascularized cancer cells to proliferate even under hypoxic conditions.	metastatic,132,142,Cell	vascularized cancer cells,152,177,Cell	"[{""token"": ""metastatic"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""vascularized cancer cells"", ""start_span"": 152, ""end_span"": 177, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
By introducing a cDNA library derived from rat embryonic fibroblast cells, we isolated several morphologically flat revertants of rat 3Y1 cells transformed by the E6 and E7 genes of human papillomavirus type 18 ( HPV18).	embryonic fibroblast cells,47,73,Cell	3Y1 cells,134,143,Cell	"[{""token"": ""embryonic fibroblast cells"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""3Y1 cells"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
Here, we compared the sensitivity of RCC cells lacking VHL gene function with that of RCC cells expressing the wild - type VHL gene ( wtVHL) after exposure to various stresses.

While the response to most treatments was not affected by the VHL gene status, glucose deprivation was found to be much more cytotoxic for RCC cells lacking VHL gene function than for wtVHL - expressing cells.

The heightened sensitivity of VHL - deficient cells was not attributed to dissimilar energy requirements or to differences in glucose uptake, but more likely reflects a lesser ability of VHL - deficient cells to handle abnormally processed proteins arising from impaired glycosylation.	cells,46,51,Cell	cells,203,208,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 203, ""end_span"": 208, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
Furthermore, ubiquitination of cellular proteins was elevated in VHL - deficient cells, particularly after glucose deprivation, supporting a role for the VHL gene in ubiquitin - mediated proteolysis.	cellular,31,39,Cell	cells,81,86,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cellular"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
Accordingly, the rate of elimination of abnormal proteins was lower in cells lacking a functional VHL gene than in wtVHL - expressing cells.	cells,71,76,Cell	cells,134,139,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
