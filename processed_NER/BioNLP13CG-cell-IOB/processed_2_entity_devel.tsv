Comparison between RNA / DNA sequence of viral oncogenes and normal human genome of non - transformed cells revealed high sequence similarities in specific genomic areas, which were named cellular proto - oncogens.

HCMV immediate - early proteins were clearly shown to be responsible for elevating p53 levels in infected fibroblasts; expression of HCMV immediate - early region 1 and 2 proteins resulted in elevation of p53 levels in transfected human fibroblasts.

This transporter was expressed on the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm of the tumor cells, but exhibited marked intratumoral and intertumoral variability in the proportions of positive cells and the intensity of staining.

The experimental studies in vitro and in vivo were performed to investigate the effects of carcinostatic agents in the adhesion of cancer cells to endothelial cells.
