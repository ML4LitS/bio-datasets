We found that induction of one splicing variant of WT1 [ WT1 - 17AA ( +) - KTS ( -)] in M1 cells induces cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death.

A long - lived line, RSVT - 2, was produced and an immortalized subclone, RSVT2 / C, was further derived under a forced crisis regimen.

RSVT - 2 and RSVT2 / C cell lines were hyperproliferative and hyperinvasive when compared with the parental HTR8 cell line.

Activation of Ca2 + entry is known to produce endothelial cell shape change, leading to increased permeability, leukocyte migration, and initiation of angiogenesis in conduit - vessel endothelial cells.

Because the identity of pulmonary endothelial SOCs is unknown, but mammalian homologues of the Drosophila melanogaster transient receptor potential ( trp) gene have been proposed to form Ca2 + entry channels in nonexcitable cells, we performed RT - PCR using Trp oligonucleotide primers in both rat and human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells.

Our study indicates that 1) Ca2 + entry in pulmonary endothelial cells through SOCs produces cell shape change that is dependent on site - specific rearrangement of the microfilamentous cytoskeleton and 2) Trp1 may be a component of pulmonary endothelial SOCs.
