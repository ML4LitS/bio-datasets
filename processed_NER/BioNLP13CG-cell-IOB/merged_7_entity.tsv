Roles of cell adhesion molecules mediating the interaction of cancer and endothelial cells in tumor angiogenesis were investigated using new in vitro and in vivo model systems with a cultured murine endothelial cell line ( F - 2) and human cultured epidermoid cancer cells ( A431).	cell,9,13,Cell	cancer,62,68,Cell	endothelial cells,73,90,Cell	endothelial cell line,199,220,Cell	F - 2,223,228,Cell	epidermoid cancer cells,249,272,Cell	A431,275,279,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cancer"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""endothelial cells"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""endothelial cell line"", ""start_span"": 199, ""end_span"": 220, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""F - 2"", ""start_span"": 223, ""end_span"": 228, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""epidermoid cancer cells"", ""start_span"": 249, ""end_span"": 272, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""A431"", ""start_span"": 275, ""end_span"": 279, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	train
SREBP activation decreased as ECs migration slowed; ( 2) Coincidental with SREBP activation, mRNA expression of its target genes such as low density lipoprotein receptor, HMG - CoA reductase, and fatty acid synthase also increased in migrating ECs population as detected by real - time PCR; ( 3) Migration induced SREBP activation in ECs was inhibited by SREBP - acting protein RNAi and pharmacologically by 25 - hydroxycholesterol; ( 4) Inhibition of SREBP led to decreased ECs migration in various models; ( 5) Cells genetically deficient in SREBP - acting protein, S1P, or S2P, phenotypically exhibited impaired migration; ( 6) SREBP inhibition in ECs suppressed the activity of small GTPase Cdc42, a key molecule for ECs motility.
