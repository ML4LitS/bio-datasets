From in vivo experiments using new methods such as the rabbit cornea, it is now becoming clear that the growth of a capillary involves an ordered sequence of events that includes lysis of the basement membrane of a parent venule, directional migration of capillary endothelial cells toward the angiogenic stimulus, lumen formation, development of branches, and anastomosis of the tip of one tube with another to form a loop.	"capillary endothelial cells	255	282	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""capillary endothelial cells"", ""start_span"": 255, ""end_span"": 282, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
It is also clear that diffusible angiogenic stimuli can be released not only from most solid tumors, but also from at least three non - neoplastic cells.	"non - neoplastic cells	130	152	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""non - neoplastic cells"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

With the recent ability to clone capillary endothelial cells and to carry them in long - term culture, it has been possible to further delineate the mechanism of capillary growth.

To explore the potential of chemotherapy directed at the tyrosine kinase of p185neu, we have found that emodin ( 3 - methyl - 1, 6, 8 - trihydroxyanthraquinone), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, suppresses autophosphorylation and transphosphorylation activities of HER - 2 / neu tyrosine kinase, resulting in tyrosine hypophosphorylation of p185neu in HER - 2 / neu - overexpressing breast cancer cells.	"breast cancer cells	379	398	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""breast cancer cells"", ""start_span"": 379, ""end_span"": 398, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Emodin, at a 40 - microM concentration, which repressed tyrosine kinase of p185neu, efficiently inhibited both anchorage - dependent and anchorage - independent growth of HER - 2 / neu - overexpressing breast cancer cells.	"breast cancer cells	202	221	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""breast cancer cells"", ""start_span"": 202, ""end_span"": 221, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
However, the inhibition was much less effective for those cells expressing basal levels of p185neu under the same conditions.	"cells	58	63	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Therefore, our results indicate that emodin inhibits HER - 2 / neu tyrosine kinase activity and preferentially suppresses growth and induces differentiation of HER - 2 / neu - overexpressing cancer cells.

We previously reported that the murine fibroblast cell line LTA is tumorigenic but non - metastatic, and is non - responsive to a transfected H - ras oncogene.	"fibroblast cell line LTA	39	63	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""fibroblast cell line LTA"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In contrast, NIH 3T3 cells are non - tumorigenic but are ras - responsive and become metastatic when transfected with ras.	"NIH 3T3 cells	13	26	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""NIH 3T3 cells"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
All four metastatic hybrids expressed 60 - 72 kDa gelatinase activity, while three of them also had 92 kDa activity and one had only minimal 92 kDa activity.	"hybrids	20	27	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""hybrids"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

Syndecan - 1 expression in mammary epithelial tumor cells is E - cadherin - dependent.	"mammary epithelial tumor cells	27	57	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""mammary epithelial tumor cells"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

Furthermore, transfection of E - cadherin cDNA into invasive NM - f - ras - TD cells resulted in the upregulation of syndecan - 1 expression in association with decreased invasiveness.
