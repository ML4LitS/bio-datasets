To this end, two candidate anti - angiogenic RNA - damaging agents, onconase and ( - 4) rhEDN, were screened for their effects on endothelial cell proliferation using three distinct types of endothelial cells in culture: HPV - 16 E6 / E7 - immortalized human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs), a Kras - transformed HPV - 16 E6 / E7 HUVEC ( Rhim et al., Carcinogenesis 4, 673 - 681, 1998), and primary HUVECs.

METHODS: Expression of MMP - 9 was studied in human NPC cell lines cultured in vitro: CNE1 ( well differentiated cell line of NPC) and CNE1 - GL ( CNE1 cell line transfected with an eukaryotic LMP1 - expression plasmid) by SP immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis.

Based on our results, we hypothesize that FGFR2 ( +) - TFs might provide cancer cells with a suitable microenvironment via secretion of proteins that could promote cancer development and progression through stimulation of cancer cell proliferation, induction of angiogenesis, inhibition of cell adhesion, enhancement of cell mobility, and promotion of the epithelial - mesenchymal transition.
