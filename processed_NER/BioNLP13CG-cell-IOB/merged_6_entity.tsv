Based on our results, we hypothesize that FGFR2 ( +) - TFs might provide cancer cells with a suitable microenvironment via secretion of proteins that could promote cancer development and progression through stimulation of cancer cell proliferation, induction of angiogenesis, inhibition of cell adhesion, enhancement of cell mobility, and promotion of the epithelial - mesenchymal transition.	cancer cells,73,85,Cell	cancer cell,222,233,Cell	cell,290,294,Cell	cell,320,324,Cell	epithelial,356,366,Cell	mesenchymal,369,380,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cancer cells"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cancer cell"", ""start_span"": 222, ""end_span"": 233, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 290, ""end_span"": 294, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 320, ""end_span"": 324, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""epithelial"", ""start_span"": 356, ""end_span"": 366, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""mesenchymal"", ""start_span"": 369, ""end_span"": 380, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	train

Now, by competition experiments with a panel of different unlabelled cells we show that the VCSA expressed on RSV - transformed hamster fibroblasts is a complex of at least three distinct antigenic specificities: ( 1) one expressed on all RSV - transformed fibroblasts, regardless their species and the subgroup or strain of the transforming virus; ( 2) one cross - reacting with a cell - surface antigen ( CSA) expressed at various degrees on untransformed avian fibroblasts, but not on mammalian fibroblasts; ( 3) one species - specific, present only on RSV - transformed hamster fibroblasts.	cells,69,74,Cell	fibroblasts,136,147,Cell	fibroblasts,257,268,Cell	fibroblasts,464,475,Cell	mammalian fibroblasts,488,509,Cell	fibroblasts,582,593,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""fibroblasts"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 147, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""fibroblasts"", ""start_span"": 257, ""end_span"": 268, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""fibroblasts"", ""start_span"": 464, ""end_span"": 475, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""mammalian fibroblasts"", ""start_span"": 488, ""end_span"": 509, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""fibroblasts"", ""start_span"": 582, ""end_span"": 593, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
When goldfish erythrophores isolated from the skin by tissue digestion and centrifugation in a Percoll density gradient were transfected in a monolayer - culture with v - Ha - ras or v - src oncogene either singly or in combination with v - myc by means of calcium phosphate - DNA co - precipitation, there appeared a certain number of transformants manifesting a chromatoblast - like profile and tumorous phenotypes as seen in the capability for unlimited growth, and piling - up in a monolayer - culture or colony formation in semi - solid soft agar.	erythrophores,14,27,Cell	monolayer,142,151,Cell	transformants,336,349,Cell	chromatoblast,364,377,Cell	monolayer,486,495,Cell	colony,509,515,Cell	"[{""token"": ""erythrophores"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""monolayer"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""transformants"", ""start_span"": 336, ""end_span"": 349, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""chromatoblast"", ""start_span"": 364, ""end_span"": 377, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""monolayer"", ""start_span"": 486, ""end_span"": 495, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""colony"", ""start_span"": 509, ""end_span"": 515, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
