In cultured stable Grm1 - mouse - melanocytic clones, as well as an metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 ( Grm1) expressing human melanoma cell line, C8161, stimulation of Grm1 by its agonist led to the activation of AKT, while preincubation with Grm1 - antagonist abolished Grm1 - agonist - induced AKT activation.

Using tamoxifen and doxorubicin - sensitive and - resistant breast cancer cell lines as models, we found that doxorubicin - but not tamoxifen - resistance is associated with nuclear accumulation of FOXO3a, consistent with the finding that sustained nuclear FOXO3a is associated with poor prognosis.

We further show that down - regulation of caspase 3 via overexpression of RASSF1C reduces breast cancer cells ' sensitivity to the apoptosis inducing agent, etoposide.

The members of an Epstein - Barr virus microRNA cluster cooperate to transform B lymphocytes.	"B lymphocytes	79	92	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""B lymphocytes"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV) transforms B lymphocytes through the expression of the latent viral proteins EBNA and latent membrane protein ( LMP).	"B lymphocytes	39	52	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""B lymphocytes"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Recently, it has become apparent that microRNAs ( miRNAs) also contribute to EBV ' s oncogenic properties; recombinant EBVs that lack the BHRF1 miRNA cluster display a reduced ability to transform B lymphocytes in vitro.

Furthermore, infected cells evince a marked upregulation of the EBNA genes.	"cells	22	27	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Using recombinant viruses that lack only one member of the cluster, we now show that all three BHRF1 miRNAs contribute to B - cell transformation.	"B - cell	122	130	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""B - cell"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

However, it is unclear whether sunitinib acts only through an antiangiogenic mechanism or whether it may also directly target tumor cells.	"tumor cells	126	137	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""tumor cells"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Sunitinib markedly induced apoptosis of PC12 cells in a dose - dependent and time - dependent manner.	"PC12 cells	40	50	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""PC12 cells"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Furthermore, in support of these findings, we found that sunitinib induced a reduction in the expression of the antiapoptotic molecule Bcl - 2 as well as dephosphorylation of the proapoptotic molecule BAD, which results in the activation of BAD in these cells.

Thus, these results together suggest that sunitinib initially exerts its apoptotic effect through the inhibition of VEGFR - 2, which, when followed by reduction of its downstream effectors, including Akt / mTOR / S6K1, may lead to inhibition of the antiapoptotic molecule Bcl - 2 and activation of the proapoptotic molecule BAD in PC12 cells.
