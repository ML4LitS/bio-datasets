CSC - high cultures and tumors expressed increased levels of the proangiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor and stromal - derived factor 1, and when signaling by either factor was blocked, all aspects of angiogenesis observed in CSC - high cultures and tumors, including microvessel density, perfusion, EPC mobilization / recruitment, and stimulation of endothelial cell activity, were reduced to levels comparable with those observed in CSC - low cultures / tumors.
