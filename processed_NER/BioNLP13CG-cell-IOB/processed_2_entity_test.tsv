In the current article we demonstrate that TnI inhibits both bFGF - stimulated and basal levels of endothelial cell proliferation, and we hypothesize that this inhibition is occurring, at least in part, via an interaction of TnI with the cell - surface bFGF receptor on capillary endothelial cells.

Preventing VEGFR1 function using antibodies or by the removal of VEGFR1 ( +) cells from the bone marrow of wild - type mice abrogates the formation of these pre - metastatic clusters and prevents tumour metastasis, whereas reconstitution with selected Id3 ( inhibitor of differentiation 3) - competent VEGFR1 + cells establishes cluster formation and tumour metastasis in Id3 knockout mice.
