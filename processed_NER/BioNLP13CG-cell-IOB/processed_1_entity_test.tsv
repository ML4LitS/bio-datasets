The aim of this study is to investigate ( 1) whether expression of COX - 2 and PPARgamma is associated with ovarian carcinogenesis and progression of ovarian tumours and ( 2) whether COX - 2 expression is controlled through ligand - mediated activation of PPARgamma in ovarian carcinoma cells.

Furthermore, in cultured ovarian carcinoma cells, Western blot revealed that PPARgamma and COX - 2 expression was regulated conversely as a result of stimulation by 15 - deoxy - Delta ( 12, 14) PGJ ( 2) ( 15 - PGJ ( 2)), a PPARgamma activator.
