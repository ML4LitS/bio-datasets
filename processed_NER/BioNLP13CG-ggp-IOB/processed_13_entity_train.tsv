SREBP activation decreased as ECs migration slowed; ( 2) Coincidental with SREBP activation, mRNA expression of its target genes such as low density lipoprotein receptor, HMG - CoA reductase, and fatty acid synthase also increased in migrating ECs population as detected by real - time PCR; ( 3) Migration induced SREBP activation in ECs was inhibited by SREBP - acting protein RNAi and pharmacologically by 25 - hydroxycholesterol; ( 4) Inhibition of SREBP led to decreased ECs migration in various models; ( 5) Cells genetically deficient in SREBP - acting protein, S1P, or S2P, phenotypically exhibited impaired migration; ( 6) SREBP inhibition in ECs suppressed the activity of small GTPase Cdc42, a key molecule for ECs motility.
