Vascular and neoplastic tissue from 14 colonic adenocarcinomas, 13 carcinoids, 6 renal - cell carcinomas and 7 malignant lymphomas were analyzed for somatostatin receptors by use of quantitative receptor autoradiography.

In contrast, the incidence and density of somatostatin receptors in peritumoral vessels was low in well - differentiated gastrointestinal and bronchial carcinoids, in contrast to the high density of such receptors in the carcinoid tumor tissue.
