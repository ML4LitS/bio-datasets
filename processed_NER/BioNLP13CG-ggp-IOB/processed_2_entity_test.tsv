Recently, genetic abnormalities in the elements of the Thyrotropin receptor ( TSH - R) dependent cAMP regulatory cascade have been found to be involved both in benign and malignant thyroid tumours.

The presence of activating mutations has been demonstrated in the TSH - R gene as well as in the Gs alpha protein gene in thyroid toxic adenoma resulting in the constitutive activation of the cAMP pathway and it has been hypothesised that these genetic alterations may play a causative role in the disease.

Activating mutations of the TSH - R gene have been detected in a group of differentiated carcinomas with high basal adenylyl cyclase activity, and in a few cases of hyperfunctioning thyroid carcinoma.

Cooccurrence of reduced expression of alpha - catenin and overexpression of p53 is a predictor of lymph node metastasis in early gastric cancer.

Proto - oncogene N - myc promoter is down regulated by the Wilms ' tumor suppressor gene WT1.

The Wilms ' tumor 1 ( WT1) gene is a tumor suppressor gene that encodes a zinc - finger transcription factor.

N - myc is coexpressed with WT1 in the developing kidney and is overexpressed in many Wilms ' tumors.

Here, we show that the proto - oncogene N - myc promoter was down - regulated by WT1 in transient transfection assays.	"N - myc	40	47	Gene_or_gene_product"	"WT1	81	84	Gene_or_gene_product"	"[{""token"": ""N - myc"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""WT1"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"
However, mutant WT1 ( R394W) which has a mutation in the DNA binding domain could not repress the N - myc promoter.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that the oligonucleotides containing the WT1 motifs could bind recombinant WT1 proteins.

This suggests that the repression of the N - myc promoter is mediated through the WT1 binding sites.

This finding may help to elucidate the relationship of WT1 and N - myc in tumorigenesis and renal development.

Direct involvement of BRCA1 in the development of breast and ovarian cancer is suggested by the finding that the BRCA1 promoter region CpG island is methylated in a proportion of breast and ovarian cancers.	"BRCA1	22	27	Gene_or_gene_product"	"BRCA1	113	118	Gene_or_gene_product"	"[{""token"": ""BRCA1"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""BRCA1"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"
The restriction of BRCA1 promoter region hypermethylation to breast and ovarian cancer is consistent with a pathogenetic role of BRCA1 promoter methylation in these tumours.

We suggest that the rarity of observed BRCA1 mutations in sporadic breast and ovarian cancer is due to the greater likelihood of BRCA1 inactivation by non - mutational mechanisms such as methylation.

To further analyze RhoA function in thyroid cell proliferation and differentiation patterns, we combined transient and stable transfection assays to express different mutant RhoA forms in FRTL - 5 cells.

BACKGROUND: Impaired expression of E - cadherin and alpha - and beta - catenin is frequently observed in several human cancers.

METHODS: Immunohistochemical staining of E - cadherin and alpha - and beta - catenin was performed using specimens from 143 patients with early gastric cancer.	"E - cadherin	41	53	Gene_or_gene_product"	"alpha - and beta - catenin	58	84	Gene_or_gene_product"	"[{""token"": ""E - cadherin"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""alpha - and beta - catenin"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"
RESULTS: Abnormal E - cadherin and beta - catenin staining correlated with depth of tumour invasion in differentiated - type tumours.

In contrast, abnormal staining was frequently found even in intramucosal carcinoma of undifferentiated - type tumours, suggesting an apparent difference in the onset of E - cadherin - catenin complex abnormality between the two cancer types.

CONCLUSIONS: We have found that patients with RDEB have elevated levels of bFGF, which may contribute to increased fibroblast collagenase and the development of squamous cell carcinoma.

Requirement of estrogen receptor expression and function for [ 12Val] K - Ras - mediated NIH3T3 cell transformation.

Gene therapy for gliomas: p53 and E2F - 1 proteins and the target of apoptosis.

We have previously shown that massive apoptosis occurs when wild - type p53 or E2F - 1 expression is induced in glioma.	"p53	72	75	Gene_or_gene_product"	"E2F - 1	79	86	Gene_or_gene_product"	"[{""token"": ""p53"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""E2F - 1"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"
However, the transfer of either the p16 or Rb gene to glioma cells results in cytostatic effect.

Careful selection of patients may be necessary before designing therapeutic strategies using either p53 or E2F - 1 as a therapeutic tools for glioma patients.

The heightened sensitivity of VHL - deficient cells was not attributed to dissimilar energy requirements or to differences in glucose uptake, but more likely reflects a lesser ability of VHL - deficient cells to handle abnormally processed proteins arising from impaired glycosylation.	"VHL	30	33	Gene_or_gene_product"	"VHL	187	190	Gene_or_gene_product"	"[{""token"": ""VHL"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""VHL"", ""start_span"": 187, ""end_span"": 190, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"
Accordingly, the rate of elimination of abnormal proteins was lower in cells lacking a functional VHL gene than in wtVHL - expressing cells.
