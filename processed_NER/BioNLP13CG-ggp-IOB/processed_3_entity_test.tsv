The aim of the present study was to clarify how expression of p53 protein participates in angiogenesis, and whether the coexpression of VEGF and p53 protein has a significance for angiogenesis and the clinicopathological features in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC).	"p53	62	65	Gene_or_gene_product"	"VEGF	136	140	Gene_or_gene_product"	"p53	145	148	Gene_or_gene_product"	"[{""token"": ""p53"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""VEGF"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""p53"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"
The MVD and Ki - 67 LI were higher, and the AI was lower in the SCC with VEGF / p53 coexpression than in those without the coexpression.

P18 showed the highest IC50 and blocked angiogenesis in vivo: P23 was inactive and P14 was proangiogenic.	"P18	0	3	Gene_or_gene_product"	"P23	62	65	Gene_or_gene_product"	"P14	83	86	Gene_or_gene_product"	"[{""token"": ""P18"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""P23"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""P14"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"
P18 increased the production of CD95 ligand and reduced the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 by the endothelial cells in vivo.

In tumor studies, P18 was more effective in blocking the angiogenesis and growth of the prostate cancer than parental 34 - mer; in the renal cell carcinoma, P18 strongly decreased angiogenesis and halted the progression of established tumors.	"P18	18	21	Gene_or_gene_product"	"parental 34 - mer	109	126	Gene_or_gene_product"	"P18	157	160	Gene_or_gene_product"	"[{""token"": ""P18"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""parental 34 - mer"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""P18"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 160, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"
However, we show here that VEGF, specifically through VEGFR2, induces phosphorylation of two serine residues on PLCbeta3, and this was confirmed in an ex vivo embryoid body model.

Knockdown of PLCbeta3 in HUVEC cells affects IP3 production, actin reorganization, migration and proliferation; whereas migration is inhibited, proliferation is enhanced.

Promotion of inflammation was also involved because lower TSP - 1 was able to up - regulate the adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule - 1.	"TSP - 1	58	65	Gene_or_gene_product"	"intercellular adhesion molecule - 1	115	150	Gene_or_gene_product"	"vascular cell adhesion molecule - 1	155	190	Gene_or_gene_product"	"[{""token"": ""TSP - 1"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""intercellular adhesion molecule - 1"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""vascular cell adhesion molecule - 1"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 190, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"
MMP2 and MMP9 activity were determined by zymographic assay, and MAPK activation by Western blotting analysis.

CONCLUSION: These results suggested that cisplatin induced a reduction of endothelial cell migration through an inhibition of MMP2 activity by downstream signal transduction pathways independent of JNK and p38 MAPK activation.

Our recent studies show that progestins induce vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) in breast cancer cells that express mutant p53 protein.

A putative progestin - response element was identified in the human TSP - 1 promoter, which is consistent with the hypothesis that a progestin - PR complex might directly regulate transcription of the TSP - 1 gene in human cells.

An analysis of the Pbx1 promoter region revealed that Evi - 1 upregulates Pbx1 transcription.	"Pbx1	19	23	Gene_or_gene_product"	"Evi - 1	54	61	Gene_or_gene_product"	"Pbx1	74	78	Gene_or_gene_product"	"[{""token"": ""Pbx1"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""Evi - 1"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""Pbx1"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"
These results indicate that Pbx1 is a target gene of Evi - 1 involved in Evi - 1 - mediated leukemogenesis.

The finding of differential SSTR expression raises the potential for SSTR expression to be evaluated as a marker of response to somatostatin analogs.	"SSTR	28	32	Gene_or_gene_product"	"SSTR	69	73	Gene_or_gene_product"	"somatostatin	128	140	Gene_or_gene_product"	"[{""token"": ""SSTR"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""SSTR"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""somatostatin"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"
To examine this hypothesis, we used NCI - H1299 non - small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) cell line ( p53 and PTEN null cell) and constructed an ICAM - 3 - over - expressing stable transfectant, which exhibited increased cell migration and invasion.	"p53	98	101	Gene_or_gene_product"	"PTEN	106	110	Gene_or_gene_product"	"ICAM - 3	141	149	Gene_or_gene_product"	"[{""token"": ""p53"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""PTEN"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""ICAM - 3"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"
ICAM - 3 also increased Akt phosphorylation, which caused an increase in cellular migration / invasion and MMP activities.	"ICAM - 3	0	8	Gene_or_gene_product"	"Akt	24	27	Gene_or_gene_product"	"MMP	107	110	Gene_or_gene_product"	"[{""token"": ""ICAM - 3"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""Akt"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""MMP"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"
Activity of several transcriptional factors located downstream in the Akt pathway was also tested, and constitutive activation of adenosine 3 ', 5 ' - monophosphate response element - binding protein ( CREB) by ICAM - 3 was detected.	"Akt	70	73	Gene_or_gene_product"	"CREB	202	206	Gene_or_gene_product"	"ICAM - 3	211	219	Gene_or_gene_product"	"[{""token"": ""Akt"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""CREB"", ""start_span"": 202, ""end_span"": 206, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""ICAM - 3"", ""start_span"": 211, ""end_span"": 219, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"
This result indicates that CREB functions in the signaling pathway between Akt and MMP.

We also showed ICAM - 3 - induced cell migration and invasion in NCI - H460 NSCLC cells ( wild - type p53 and PTEN cell) through the same signaling pathway.

Several members were detected in insulinoma cell lines and rat islets and expression levels positively correlated with insulin abundance, particularly for p24delta1 and p24beta1.	"insulin	33	40	Gene_or_gene_product"	"p24delta1	155	164	Gene_or_gene_product"	"p24beta1	169	177	Gene_or_gene_product"	"[{""token"": ""insulin"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""p24delta1"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 164, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""p24beta1"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 177, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"
These results suggest that p24delta1 and possibly other p24 family proteins are required for normal insulin biosynthesis and subsequent secretion in pancreatic beta - cells.

KISS1 and matrix metalloproteinase - 9 ( MMP - 9) may play important roles as metastasis suppressor and metastasis promoter genes, respectively, in a variety of malignancies.

As predicted, these MEFs upregulated Hif - 1alpha and HIF target genes directly as a result of FH deficiency.

We show that enhanced glycolysis is dependent on HIF - 1alpha up - regulation, while reduced mitochondrial activity is HIF - 1alpha - independent and likely caused by STAT3 - mediated down - regulation of mitochondrial proteins.

Oocytes in double - mutant females showed normal localization of brca2 and pou5f1 transcripts to the animal pole and vasa transcripts to the vegetal pole, but had a polarized rather than symmetrical nucleus with the distribution of nucleoli and chromosomes to opposite nuclear poles; this result revealed a novel role for Brca2 in establishing or maintaining oocyte nuclear architecture.

Mutating tp53 did not rescue the infertility phenotype in brca2 mutant males, suggesting that brca2 plays an essential role in zebrafish spermatogenesis.

Desensitization of prostaglandin F2 alpha - stimulated inositol phosphate generation in NIH - 3T3 fibroblasts transformed by overexpression of normal c - Ha - ras - 1, c - Ki - ras - 2 and c - N - ras genes.

These results suggest that desensitization of certain agonist - induced inositol phospholipid responses in ras - transformed cells is a consequence of increased cell proliferation and associated amplification in C - kinase activity and is an indirect consequence of transformation by ras.

Transformation of BHK hamster fibroblasts by an env - strain of Rous sarcoma virus ( RSV) leads to the appearance at the cell surface of a virus - induced nonvirion antigen ( VCSA), specific for transformation, whose expression is controlled by the transforming src gene.

Now, by competition experiments with a panel of different unlabelled cells we show that the VCSA expressed on RSV - transformed hamster fibroblasts is a complex of at least three distinct antigenic specificities: ( 1) one expressed on all RSV - transformed fibroblasts, regardless their species and the subgroup or strain of the transforming virus; ( 2) one cross - reacting with a cell - surface antigen ( CSA) expressed at various degrees on untransformed avian fibroblasts, but not on mammalian fibroblasts; ( 3) one species - specific, present only on RSV - transformed hamster fibroblasts.

Here, we compared the sensitivity of RCC cells lacking VHL gene function with that of RCC cells expressing the wild - type VHL gene ( wtVHL) after exposure to various stresses.

While the response to most treatments was not affected by the VHL gene status, glucose deprivation was found to be much more cytotoxic for RCC cells lacking VHL gene function than for wtVHL - expressing cells.	"VHL	62	65	Gene_or_gene_product"	"VHL	157	160	Gene_or_gene_product"	"wtVHL	184	189	Gene_or_gene_product"	"[{""token"": ""VHL"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""VHL"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 160, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""wtVHL"", ""start_span"": 184, ""end_span"": 189, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"
Furthermore, ubiquitination of cellular proteins was elevated in VHL - deficient cells, particularly after glucose deprivation, supporting a role for the VHL gene in ubiquitin - mediated proteolysis.
