BACKGROUND: The anabolic properties of insulin have been suggested for use to reverse malnutrition associated with cancer.	"insulin	39	46	Gene_or_gene_product"	"[{""token"": ""insulin"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"

The authors studied insulin effects on tumor and skeletal muscle metabolism with 2 - [ 18F] - fluoro - 2 - deoxy - D - glucose ( [ 18F] FDG) and positron emission tomography ( PET).

RESULTS: In lymphomatous tissue, [ 18F] FDG uptake rates were similar in overnight fasting and euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp ( 38 + / - 10 versus 41 + / - 9 mumol / 100 g / minute, not significant), whereas glucose uptake in skeletal muscle was increased by insulin ( 1. 7 + / - 0. 2 versus 3. 8 + / - 0. 5 mumol / 100 g / minute, P = 0. 012).

Both basal ( 2. 3 + / - 0. 2 mumol / 100 g / minute, P = 0. 061) and insulin - stimulated ( 8. 5 + / - 1. 9 mumol / 100 g / minute, P = 0. 055) skeletal arm muscle glucose uptake rates were higher in control subjects than in patients.

Whole body glucose use was 55% lower in patients than in control subjects ( 17 + / - 3 mumol / kg / minute versus 38 + / - 3 mumol / kg / minute, P = 0. 002), consistent with insulin resistance in cancer.

Our study indicates that 1) Ca2 + entry in pulmonary endothelial cells through SOCs produces cell shape change that is dependent on site - specific rearrangement of the microfilamentous cytoskeleton and 2) Trp1 may be a component of pulmonary endothelial SOCs.

The molecular basis of this behaviour could be related to different locations for the lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes, as suggested by their immunohistochemical labelling.

Effect of U - 995, a potent shark cartilage - derived angiogenesis inhibitor, on anti - angiogenesis and anti - tumor activities.	"U - 995	10	17	Gene_or_gene_product"	"[{""token"": ""U - 995"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"
BACKGROUND: A potent angiogenesis inhibitor, U - 995, has been purified from the cartilage of the blue shark ( Prionace glauca).	"U - 995	45	52	Gene_or_gene_product"	"[{""token"": ""U - 995"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"
U - 995 is composed of two single peptides with molecular mass of 10 and 14 kDa, respectively.	"U - 995	0	7	Gene_or_gene_product"	"[{""token"": ""U - 995"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"
Furthermore, we determined the ability of U - 995 to inhibiting tumor cell growth and metastasis.	"U - 995	42	49	Gene_or_gene_product"	"[{""token"": ""U - 995"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"
RESULTS: U - 995 ( 15 and 30 micrograms / ml) markedly inhibited HUVEC migration and, at 15 - 50 micrograms / ml produced a dose - dependent decline in [ 3H] - thymidine incorporation.	"U - 995	9	16	Gene_or_gene_product"	"[{""token"": ""U - 995"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"
In addition, when 200 micrograms U - 995 was injected i. p. into mice it suppressed sarcoma - 180 cell growth and B16 - F10 mouse melanoma cell metastasis in vivo.
