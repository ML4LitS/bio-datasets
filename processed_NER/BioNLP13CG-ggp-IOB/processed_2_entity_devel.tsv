We observed a significant up - regulation of VEGF - B ( P = 0. 002) but not VEGF - C ( P = 0. 3) in neoplastic kidney compared with normal tissues.

Nevertheless, the repression of VEGF - C was lost in mutant VHL cell lines under hypoxia.

Membrane - anchored Cbl suppresses Hck protein - tyrosine kinase mediated cellular transformation.

Hck - mediated cellular transformation of murine fibroblasts is reverted by ectopic expression of a membrane - anchored allele of Cbl as assessed by the cellular morphology, suppression of anchorage independent growth, and an overall reduction in the total tyrosine phosphorylation levels within the cells.

The expression of Cbl at the plasma membrane targets both Hck and itself for ubiquitination and degradation, requiring an intact RING finger.

Activated Hck and membrane - anchored Cbl are present in similar subcellular localizations and co - immunoprecipitate, suggesting that their interaction is required for subsequent ubiquitination and degradation.

METHODS: An mIL - 12 expression vector driven by cytomegalovirus promoter was used to express murine IL - 12 cDNA in the RM - 9 murine prostate carcinoma cell line.

Control RM - 9 cells and RM - 9 cells stably transfected with IL - 12 gene ( RM - 9 - IL12) were inoculated subcutaneously in 4 - to 6 - week - old male C57BL / J6 mice.

Furthermore, we found that p130 ( Cas), but not paxillin, recruited Crk to the nascent focal complex.

The dominant negative mutant of Rac1 completely inhibited ephrin - B1 - induced membrane ruffling and focal complex assembly.

However, in rap1GAPII - expressing cells, ephrin - B1 did not induce membrane spreading, probably due to instability of the focal complex.

Among the sequence variations, there was a change from G to T at nucleotide position 169, 426, resulting in the loss of an XhoI site in exon 1 of the LMP gene.

Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) is a vascular growth factor which induces angiogenesis ( the development of new blood vessels), vascular permeability, and inflammation.

To define these roles more clearly, we examined the expression of DCC and its ligand, netrin - 1, in the normal endometrium and in endometrial cancer.

METHODS: The expression of DCC and netrin - 1 in normal endometrial glands and in cancer cell lines was examined by RT - PCR and immunohistochemistry.

However, it is completely absent from cells transformed by the oncogene v - myc or v - src and from cells derived from a methylcholanthrene - induced fibrosarcoma.

Since other DNA tumor viruses, such as simian virus 40 and adenovirus, have previously been shown to interact with cellular protein p53, we investigated whether infection of cells by HCMV would modulate cellular p53 levels.

Molecular mechanisms of pituitary tumorigenesis were studied using Polymerase chain reaction - single stranded conformational polymorphism with DNA sequencing to identify potential mutations in the ras protooncogenes and the tumor suppressor gene p53 in invasive pituitary adenomas and carcinomas.

Since the vessels of normal non - neoplastic human tissues, e. g. of intestine or lymphatic organs, have few somatostatin receptors, the increased somatostatin receptor expression in peritumoral vessels observed in this study may be linked to the neoplastic process itself.

The results suggest that somatostatin and somatostatin receptors may play a regulatory role for hemodynamic tumor - host interactions, possibly involving tumor stroma generation, tumor environment, angiogenesis and, particularly, vascular drainage of poorly differentiated neoplasms.

Syndecan - 1 expression in mammary epithelial tumor cells is E - cadherin - dependent.

Syndecan - 1 is a cell surface proteoglycan that has been implicated in a number of cellular functions including cell - cell adhesion, cell - matrix anchorage and growth factor presentation for signalling receptors.

In order to better understand the coordinated regulation of cell - cell and cell - matrix interactions during malignant transformation, we have studied the expression of syndecan - 1 in malignant mammary tumor cells genetically manipulated for E - cadherin expression.	"syndecan - 1	170	182	Gene_or_gene_product"	"E - cadherin	244	256	Gene_or_gene_product"	"[{""token"": ""syndecan - 1"", ""start_span"": 170, ""end_span"": 182, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""E - cadherin"", ""start_span"": 244, ""end_span"": 256, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"
In invasive NM - e - ras - MAC1 cells, where E - cadherin was partially downregulated by specific antisense RNA, syndecan - 1 expression was suppressed.	"E - cadherin	45	57	Gene_or_gene_product"	"syndecan - 1	113	125	Gene_or_gene_product"	"[{""token"": ""E - cadherin"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""syndecan - 1"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"
Furthermore, transfection of E - cadherin cDNA into invasive NM - f - ras - TD cells resulted in the upregulation of syndecan - 1 expression in association with decreased invasiveness.	"E - cadherin cDNA	29	46	Gene_or_gene_product"	"syndecan - 1	117	129	Gene_or_gene_product"	"[{""token"": ""E - cadherin cDNA"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""syndecan - 1"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"
In both cases, regulation of syndecan - 1 occurred post - transcriptionally, since syndecan - 1 mRNA levels remained unchanged.

Instead, a translational regulation is suggested, since syndecan - 1 core protein synthesis was E - cadherin dependent.

Another cell adhesion protein, beta 1 - integrin was not affected by E - cadherin expression.

The data provide an example of coordinated changes in the expression of two cell adhesion molecules, syndecan - 1 and E - cadherin during epithelial cell transformation.

Thus, 5T4 molecules can deliver signals through both the extracellular and intracellular domains, and the resultant effects are consistent with a role for 5T4 molecules in invasion processes.

Increased urokinase plasminogen activator ( uPA) levels are increased in a number of malignancies and have been correlated with decreased disease - free interval and decreased overall survival.

uPA and uPAR levels were not significantly associated with tumour staging or survival.

Because these phenomena are all of critical importance during morphogenesis, and because FAK is expressed in embryonic cells, evidence has been accumulating to indicate that FAK may be an important modulator of developmental processes.
