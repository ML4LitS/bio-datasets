Adenovirus - mediated p53 gene transfer is ineffective in causing apoptosis in glioma cells that retain wild - type p53 genotype or overexpress the p21 protein.	p53,22,25,Gene_or_gene_product	p53,116,119,Gene_or_gene_product	p21,148,151,Gene_or_gene_product	"[{""token"": ""p53"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""p53"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""p21"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"	test
The p16 / Rb / E2F pathway is the most frequent target of genetic alterations in gliomas, and therefore constitutes a suitable target for gene therapy strategies.	p16,4,7,Gene_or_gene_product	Rb,10,12,Gene_or_gene_product	E2F,15,18,Gene_or_gene_product	"[{""token"": ""p16"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""E2F"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"	test
