BACKGROUND: The PI3K - Akt signal pathway plays a key role in tumorigenesis and the development of drug - resistance.

Using tamoxifen and doxorubicin - sensitive and - resistant breast cancer cell lines as models, we found that doxorubicin - but not tamoxifen - resistance is associated with nuclear accumulation of FOXO3a, consistent with the finding that sustained nuclear FOXO3a is associated with poor prognosis.	"FOXO3a	198	204	Gene_or_gene_product"	"FOXO3a	257	263	Gene_or_gene_product"	"[{""token"": ""FOXO3a"", ""start_span"": 198, ""end_span"": 204, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""FOXO3a"", ""start_span"": 257, ""end_span"": 263, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"
Induction of FOXO3a activity in doxorubicin - sensitive MCF - 7 cells was sufficient to promote Akt phosphorylation and arrest cell proliferation.

However FOXO3a induction has little effect on cell proliferation, indicating that FOXO3a or its downstream activity is deregulated in the cytotoxic drug resistant breast cancer cells.

CONCLUSIONS / SIGNIFICANCE: Together these data suggest that lymph node metastasis and poor survival in invasive ductal breast carcinoma are linked to an uncoupling of the Akt - FOXO3a signaling axis.

The clinical relevance of Brk1 is emphasized by correlative data showing that Von Hippel - Lindau ( VHL) patients that also lose the BRK1 gene are protected against the development of tumors.

Finally, genetic ablation of Brk1 results in dramatic defects in embryo compaction and development, suggesting an essential role for this protein in actin dynamics.

We further show that down - regulation of caspase 3 via overexpression of RASSF1C reduces breast cancer cells ' sensitivity to the apoptosis inducing agent, etoposide.

MTSS1 ( metastasis suppressor - 1) was first identified as a metastasis suppressor missing in metastatic bladder carcinoma cell lines.

While accumlating evidence for the function of MTSS1 support the concept that it is unlikely to be a metastasis suppressor, but actually acts as a scaffold protein that interacts with multiple partners to regulate actin dynamics.

Intriguingly, metabolic stress triggers primarily an adaptive ( rather than pro - apoptotic) p53 response, and p53 is emerging as an important regulator of metabolic homeostasis.

The basal phosphorylation of protein kinase C substrate of relative molecular mass ( Mr) 80, 000 ( 80K) is significantly increased in all the ras - transformed cell lines.

Epidermal growth factor ( EGF) binds with high affinity and specificity to a single site on the external domain of its transmembrane receptor to activate the tyrosine protein kinase activity of its cytoplasmic portion.

The EGF receptor gene is amplified and over - expressed in several human tumors, suggesting that increased concentrations of the proto - oncogene leads to constitutive activity similar to that seen with oncogene erb B.

The mean baseline calcitonin level correlated with the histologic findings ( r = 0. 71, P = 0. 003) but there was no correlation between pentagastrin - stimulated calcitonin levels and histology ( r = 0. 21, P = 0. 47).

The induction of Ets - 1 in ECs after denudation was regulated transcriptionally, and humeral factors released from injured ECs might not be responsible.

Mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK) activities were investigated to explore the mechanism of this induction.

PD98059, a specific MAPK / ERK kinase ( MEK) 1 inhibitor, did not affect the induction of ets - 1 mRNA, whereas SB203580, a specific p38 inhibitor, almost completely abrogated its induction.

These results indicate that Ets - 1 is induced in ECs after denudation through activation of p38.

In conclusion, the metastasis from TRP - 1 / Tag RPE tumors towards spleen and lymph nodes serves as potential tool to investigate biology and metastasis of tumors derived from the pigment epithelium.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: U - 995 was designed to study human umbilical vein endothelial cell ( HUVEC) migration and proliferation in vitro and angiogenesis induced by TNF alpha in chicken chorioallantoic membrane ( CAM).

30 and 50 micrograms / ml of U - 995, when added to TNF alpha - induced angiogenesis caused discontinuous and disrupted blood vessels.
