Here, we examine the relationship of caspase - 2 processing and cell death to induction of caspase - 3 ( CPP32) - like activity in PC12 cells.	"caspase - 2	37	48	Protein"	"caspase - 3	91	102	Protein"	"CPP32	105	110	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""caspase - 2"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""caspase - 3"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CPP32"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Agents previously shown to inhibit caspase - 3 - like activation, such as bcl - 2 and the Cdk inhibitor flavopiridol, also acted upstream of caspase - 2 processing.
