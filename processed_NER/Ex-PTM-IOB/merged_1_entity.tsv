We found that some, but not all, of the substitutions of the amino acid residues other than the Cys also inhibited isoprenylation and that the status of isoprenylation of these mutant proteins correlated well with their abilities to be packaged with HBsAg into virions.	HBsAg,250,255,Protein	"[{""token"": ""HBsAg"", ""start_span"": 250, ""end_span"": 255, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test

In contrast, the deletion of 33 amino acids ( amino acids 163 to 195) upstream of the last C - terminal 19 amino acids of LHDAg did not interfere with its packaging ability.	LHDAg,122,127,Protein	"[{""token"": ""LHDAg"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test

The prenylation of K - Ras, on the other hand, was highly resistant to FTI - 277 and GGTI - 298.	K - Ras,19,26,Protein	"[{""token"": ""K - Ras"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Most significantly, treatment of human tumor cell lines with both inhibitors was required for inhibition of K - Ras prenylation.	K - Ras,108,115,Protein	"[{""token"": ""K - Ras"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
In one cell line, the human lung adenocarcinoma A - 549, prenylation of K - Ras was highly resistant even when co - treated with both inhibitors.	K - Ras,72,79,Protein	"[{""token"": ""K - Ras"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Furthermore, soft agar experiments demonstrated that in all the human tumor cell lines tested inhibition of K - Ras prenylation was not necessary for inhibition of anchorage - independent growth.

Pro108 is important for folding and stabilization of adrenal ferredoxin, but does not influence the functional properties of the protein.	adrenal ferredoxin,53,71,Protein	"[{""token"": ""adrenal ferredoxin"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Comparative thermodynamic studies with the Met - adrenodoxin - ( 4 - 108) - peptide indicated that removal of Pro108 resulted in an extensive decrease of the overall stability of the protein in either oxidation state.	adrenodoxin,49,60,Protein	"[{""token"": ""adrenodoxin"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
This newly developed MoAb, KPL1, inhibited interactions between P - selectin expressing COS cells and either HL60 cells, neutrophils, or lymphocytes.	P - selectin,64,76,Protein	"[{""token"": ""P - selectin"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Interestingly, plasma cells in situ and interleukin - 6 - dependent myeloma cell lines were KPL1 ( +).	interleukin - 6,40,55,Protein	"[{""token"": ""interleukin - 6"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Thus, PSGL - 1 is expressed on essentially all blood neutrophils, NK cells, B cells, T cells, and monocytes.	PSGL - 1,6,14,Protein	"[{""token"": ""PSGL - 1"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
We report the cloning and characterization of a novel membrane - bound, calcium - independent PLA2, named cPLA2 - gamma.	cPLA2 - gamma,106,119,Protein	"[{""token"": ""cPLA2 - gamma"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
However, cPLA2 - gamma does contain two consensus motifs for lipid modification, a prenylation motif ( - CCLA) at the C terminus and a myristoylation site at the N terminus.	cPLA2 - gamma,9,22,Protein	"[{""token"": ""cPLA2 - gamma"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
We present evidence that the isoprenoid precursor [ 3H] mevalonolactone is incorporated into the prenylation motif of cPLA2 - gamma.	cPLA2 - gamma,118,131,Protein	"[{""token"": ""cPLA2 - gamma"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Interestingly, cPLA2 - gamma demonstrates a preference for arachidonic acid at the sn - 2 position of phosphatidylcholine as compared with palmitic acid.	cPLA2 - gamma,15,28,Protein	"[{""token"": ""cPLA2 - gamma"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
cPLA2 - gamma encodes a 3 - kilobase message, which is highly expressed in heart and skeletal muscle, suggesting a specific role in these tissues.	cPLA2 - gamma,0,13,Protein	"[{""token"": ""cPLA2 - gamma"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
DNA was extracted from peripheral leukocytes and subjected to polymerase chain reaction - single stranded conformation polymorphism analysis using primers for the exons of the CHM gene.	CHM,176,179,Protein	"[{""token"": ""CHM"", ""start_span"": 176, ""end_span"": 179, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
RESULTS: The authors detected REP - 1 in protein samples extracted from lymphoblastoid cell lines from female carriers but not from CHM males.	REP - 1,30,37,Protein	"[{""token"": ""REP - 1"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test

Apoprotein B100 has a prolonged interaction with the translocon during which its lipidation and translocation change from dependence on the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein to independence.
