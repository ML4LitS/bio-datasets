Constitutive secretory vesicles carrying heparan sulfate proteoglycan ( HSPG) were identified in isolated rat hepatocytes by pulse - chase experiments with [ 35S] sulfate and purified by velocity - controlled sucrose gradient centrifugation followed by equilibrium density centrifugation in Nycodenz.

We demonstrate that the activation of DRAT in response to an anaerobic shift is transient but that the duration of DRAT activation in response to added NH4 + varies with the NH4 + concentration.

It was possible to express the beta 1 and gamma 2 gene products independently of each other in this system, as determined by using immunological and metabolic labeling techniques.

Thus, prenyl modification of gamma 2 directs the membrane association of the beta 1 gamma 2 dimer and increases its apparent affinity for receptor, but it is not required for the functional interaction ( s) of the dimer.

We have previously shown that caspase - 2 ( Nedd - 2) is required for apoptosis induced by withdrawal of trophic support from PC12 cells and sympathetic neurons.

In contrast, the more selective caspase inhibitor DEVD - FMK inhibited the induction of caspase - 3 - like activity but did not affect caspase - 2 processing or significantly suppress death in PC12 cells or sympathetic neurons.
