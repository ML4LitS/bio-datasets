Labeling of the chymotryptic fragments is markedly reduced when GLYASKLS, a high - affinity substrate derived from residues 2 - 9 of S. cerevisiae ADP - ribosylation factor 2, or ALYASKLS, a competitive inhibitor ( for peptide), is added with the iodinated photopeptide.

Finally, automated sequential Edman degradation of these chymotryptic fragments suggests that the peptide binding domain of Nmt1p may be composed of elements from two protease - resistant domains, Arg42 - Try219 and Thr220 - Leu455.

For gcs1 delta suppression, both a protein kinase domain and a C - terminal prenylation motif were shown to be necessary.	"gcs1	4	8	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""gcs1"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Activation of p21 ( ras) by GTP loading is a critical step in a cascade of intracellular insulin signaling.	"insulin	89	96	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""insulin"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In vitro and in vivo FTase activities were studied in 3T3 - L1 adipocytes in response to insulin challenge.	"insulin	89	96	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""insulin"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Insulin exerted a biphasic stimulatory effect on FTase activity measured in vitro with a 31% increase at 5 min and a 130% increase at 60 min.	"Insulin	0	7	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Insulin"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Insulin challenge of 3T3 - L1 adipocytes increased incorporation of tritiated mevalonic acid in p21 ( ras) in a dose - dependent manner and stimulated a 2 - fold increase in phosphorylation of the alpha - subunit of FTase at 5 min and a 4 - fold increase at 60 min.
