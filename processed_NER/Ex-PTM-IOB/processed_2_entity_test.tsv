Interestingly, these mutated proteins exhibited reduced cell surface detection by antibody compared to wild - type CD81, but this was not due to differences in the level of protein expression, trafficking to the cell surface, protein stability, or anti - CD81 antibody binding affinity.

Instead, the mutant CD81 proteins appeared to be partially hidden from detection by anti - CD81 antibody, presumably due to altered interactions with other proteins at the cell surface.
