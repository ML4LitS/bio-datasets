Overall and reactive rate constants for the O2 ( 1Deltag) - quenching ( in the order of 108 and 107 / M / s, respectively), and rates of oxygen consumption determined by time - resolved, spectroscopic and polarographic methods indicate that alpha - and beta - chymotrypsins are less photooxidizable at pH 6, as a result of an enhancement of the O2 ( 1Deltag) - physical quenching component.

By directly visualizing individual insertion events of the AMPAR subunit GluR1 in rodents, we found that the protein 4. 1N was required for activity - dependent GluR1 insertion.

Computer aided analysis suggested that DEV pUL51 is not targeted to the mitochondrial, extra - cellular or nucleus, but be targeted to the cytoplasmic in host cells, more specifically, palmitoylation of the pUL51 through the N - terminal cysteine at position 9 makes membrane association and Golgi localization possible.

From these results, we concluded that palmitoylation at the N - terminal cysteine, which is conserved in all alphaherpesvirus UL51 homologs, is required for its membrane association and Golgi localization, and the pUL51 mainly localized to the juxtanuclear region of DEV - infected cells, as well seemed to be incorporated into mature virions as a component of the tegument.

To study the stabilization of proteins within this structure and the contribution of these proteins to the integrity of the PSD, we tagged synaptic proteins with PAGFP ( photoactivatable green fluorescent protein) and used combined two - photon laser - scanning microscopy and two - photon laser photoactivation to measure their rate of turnover in individual spines of rat CA1 pyramidal neurons.

Analysis of a series of PSD - 95 mutants revealed that distinct domains stabilize PSD - 95 within the PSD and contribute to PSD formation.

Stabilization of PSD - 95 within the PSD requires N - terminal palmitoylation and protein interactions mediated by the first and second PDZ domains, whereas formation of a stable lattice of PSD - 95 molecules within the PSD additionally requires the C - terminal SH3 domain.	"PSD - 95	17	25	Protein"	"PSD - 95	190	198	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PSD - 95"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PSD - 95"", ""start_span"": 190, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore, in a PDZ domain 1 and 2 dependent manner, activation of NMDA receptors with a chemical long - term depression protocol rapidly destabilizes PSD - 95 and causes a subset of the PSD - 95 molecules previously anchored in the spine to be released.	"PSD - 95	153	161	Protein"	"PSD - 95	189	197	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PSD - 95"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PSD - 95"", ""start_span"": 189, ""end_span"": 197, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, through the analysis of rates of exchange of synaptic PSD - 95, we determine separate domains of PSD - 95 that play specific roles in establishing a stable postsynaptic lattice, in allowing proteins to enter this lattice, and in reorganizing this structure in response to plasticity - inducing stimuli.

According to recent studies on protein chemistry and genetic engineering, replacement of the Val30 residue of prealbumin by methionine is believed to play a critical role in the formation of amyloid deposit and the pathogenesis of familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy ( FAP).
