Analysis of cellular interaction partners of OTUB1 by co - immunoprecipitation and MS / MS ( tandem mass spectrometry) experiments demonstrated that FUS [ fusion involved in t ( 12; 6) in malignant liposarcoma; also known as TLS ( translocation in liposarcoma) or CHOP ( CCAAT / enhancer - binding protein homologous protein)] and RACK1 [ receptor for activated kinase 1; also known as GNB2L1 ( guanine - nucleotide - binding protein beta polypeptide 2 - like 1)] are part of OTUB1 - containing complexes, pointing towards a molecular function of this deubiquitinating enzyme in RNA processing and cell adhesion / morphology.
