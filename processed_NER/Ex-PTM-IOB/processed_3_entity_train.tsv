Among 11 subtypes of heterotrimeric G - protein gamma - subunit, gamma1 ( rod), gamma8 ( cone) and gamma11 are modified with farnesyl while the others are modified with geranylgeranyl at the C - terminus.

To understand the role of specific isoprenylation ( farnesylation) of retinal transducin, we examined how and to what extent the type of isoprenyl group affects transducin - beta gamma ( beta1 gamma1) functions such as interactions with membranes, Galpha / receptor, and effectors.	"gamma	179	184	Protein"	"beta1	187	192	Protein"	"gamma1	193	199	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""gamma"", ""start_span"": 179, ""end_span"": 184, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""beta1"", ""start_span"": 187, ""end_span"": 192, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""gamma1"", ""start_span"": 193, ""end_span"": 199, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To this end, the C - terminal farnesylation signal sequence ( CVIS) of gamma1 was replaced by a geranylgeranylation signal ( CVIL), and the resultant mutant ( S74L) or wild - type ( WT) gamma1 was coexpressed with beta1 in the baculovirus - Tn5 insect cell system.	"gamma1	71	77	Protein"	"gamma1	186	192	Protein"	"beta1	214	219	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""gamma1"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""gamma1"", ""start_span"": 186, ""end_span"": 192, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""beta1"", ""start_span"": 214, ""end_span"": 219, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Functionally, beta1 gamma1S74L was the most potent to promote pertussis toxin - catalyzed ADP ribosylation of transducin - alpha ( Talpha), to stimulate metarhodopsin II - catalyzed GTPgammaS - binding reaction to Talpha and to modulate adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C activities.

C3 exoenzyme, an inhibitor of the geranylgeranylated - activated Rho protein, reproduced the effect of lovastatin on tPA and plasminogen activator inhibitor - 1 activity and blocked its reversal by geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate.

In vitro GST pull - down assay demonstrated that UCH - L3 bound to both NEDD8 and ubiquitin.	"UCH - L3	49	57	Protein"	"NEDD8	72	77	Protein"	"ubiquitin	82	91	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""UCH - L3"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""NEDD8"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ubiquitin"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Recombinant UCH - L3, but not UCH - L1, was able to cleave the C - terminus of NEDD8.	"UCH - L3	12	20	Protein"	"UCH - L1	30	38	Protein"	"NEDD8	79	84	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""UCH - L3"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""UCH - L1"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""NEDD8"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, UCH - L3 can function as a C - terminal hydrolase for both NEDD8 and ubiquitin.	"UCH - L3	6	14	Protein"	"NEDD8	65	70	Protein"	"ubiquitin	75	84	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""UCH - L3"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""NEDD8"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ubiquitin"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
UCH - L3 may play a physiologically significant role in the cleavage of the C - terminus of NEDD8, which is required for NEDD8 to conjugate to target proteins.

These results suggest that Yap1p localization is largely regulated at the level of nuclear export, and that the oxidation state affects the accessibility of the Yap1p NES to Crm1p directly.

We also show that a mutation in RanGAP ( rna1 - 1) is synthetically lethal with crm1 mutants.
