In one male who lacked REP - 1, direct sequencing of exon 7 showed a cytosine - to - thymine transition mutation ( Arg293X) in the CHM gene.

CONCLUSIONS: The clinical diagnosis of CHM can be confirmed simply by immunoblot analysis with anti - REP - 1 antibody, showing the absence of REP - 1 protein in peripheral blood samples.	REP - 1,102,109,Protein	REP - 1,143,150,Protein	"[{""token"": ""REP - 1"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""REP - 1"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Because all known mutations in the CHM gene create stop codons that truncate the protein product and result in absence of REP - 1, the authors predict that most patients with CHM can be diagnosed by this procedure.

We identified two orthologous genes, ATPSK2 and Atpsk2, encoding novel ATP sulfurylase / APS kinase orthologues in the respective regions of the human and mouse genomes.

We characterized a nonsense mutation in ATPSK2 in the SEMD family and a missense mutation in the region of Atpsk2 encoding the APS kinase activity in the brachymorphic mouse.

To investigate apoB100 biosynthesis and secretion further, the physical and functional states of apoB100 destined for either degradation or lipoprotein assembly were studied under conditions in which lipid synthesis, proteasomal activity, and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein ( MTP) lipid - transfer activity were varied.	apoB100,15,22,Protein	apoB100,97,104,Protein	"[{""token"": ""apoB100"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""apoB100"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
When lipid synthesis and lipoprotein assembly / secretion were stimulated by adding oleic acid ( OA) to the chase medium, apoB100 was deubiquitinated, and its interaction with sec61beta was disrupted, signifying completion of translocation concomitant with the formation of lipoprotein particles.	apoB100,122,129,Protein	sec61beta,176,185,Protein	"[{""token"": ""apoB100"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sec61beta"", ""start_span"": 176, ""end_span"": 185, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
In contrast, when the labeled apoB100 was allowed to accumulate in the cell for 60 min before adding OA and the inhibitor, apoB100 lipidation and secretion were no longer impaired.	apoB100,30,37,Protein	apoB100,123,130,Protein	"[{""token"": ""apoB100"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""apoB100"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Overall, the data imply that during most of its association with the endoplasmic reticulum, apoB100 is close to or within the translocon and is accessible to both the ubiquitin - proteasome and lipoprotein - assembly pathways.	apoB100,92,99,Protein	ubiquitin,167,176,Protein	"[{""token"": ""apoB100"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ubiquitin"", ""start_span"": 167, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
