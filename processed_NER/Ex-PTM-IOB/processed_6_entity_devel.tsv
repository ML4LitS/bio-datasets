Employing a two - hybrid approach with both yeast genomic and mouse cDNA libraries in parallel, we have identified the RING - like zinc finger containing Miz1 / PIASxbeta / Siz2, which is a ubiquitin - protein isopeptide ligase in the SUMO pathway, as the potential nuclear cofactor that interacts with both TFII - I and hMusTRD1 / BEN.

Although they bind TG1, TIG3 mutants lacking the conserved N - terminal region drive apoptosis - like cell death characterized by cell rounding, membrane blebbing, cytochrome c release, procaspase - 3 and poly ( ADP - ribose) polymerase ( PARP) cleavage, and reduced p53 and p21 levels.

These findings suggest that TIG3 interaction with TG1 does not require the N - terminal conserved domains, that the TIG3 N - terminal region is required for TIG3 - dependent keratinocyte differentiation, that its removal converts TIG3 into a proapoptotic protein, and that this change in action of TIG3 is associated with an intracellular redistribution.
