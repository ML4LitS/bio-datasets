When tested for its ability to support GTP - for - GDP exchange catalyzed by R *, demethylated T beta gamma proved to be approximately 50% as active as methylated T beta gamma in photoreceptor disk membranes ( Fig. 3) and in reconstituted liposomes containing rhodopsin.

Both proteins are identical except for the presence of additional 19 amino acids at the C terminus of LHDAg.	"LHDAg	102	107	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LHDAg"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The C - terminal last 4 amino acids of LHDAg ( Cys - Arg - Pro - Gln) is an isoprenylation motif.	"LHDAg	39	44	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LHDAg"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We found that some, but not all, of the substitutions of the amino acid residues other than the Cys also inhibited isoprenylation and that the status of isoprenylation of these mutant proteins correlated well with their abilities to be packaged with HBsAg into virions.	"HBsAg	250	255	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""HBsAg"", ""start_span"": 250, ""end_span"": 255, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This result indicates that isoprenylation, rather than the primary amino acid sequence, is required for LHDAg packaging.	"LHDAg	104	109	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LHDAg"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In contrast, the deletion of 33 amino acids ( amino acids 163 to 195) upstream of the last C - terminal 19 amino acids of LHDAg did not interfere with its packaging ability.	"LHDAg	122	127	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LHDAg"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, we conclude that the 15 amino acids upstream of the isoprenylation site of LHDAg are also essential for HDV assembly, and a large portion of the alleged C - terminal Pro / Gly - rich region ( amino acids 146 to 195) is not required for the assembly process.
