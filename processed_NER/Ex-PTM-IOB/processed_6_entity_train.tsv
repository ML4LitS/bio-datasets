Our results suggest the following: ( i) type I and type II t - PA are N - glycosylated in an identical way at Asn - 117 and Asn - 448, when isolated from the same cell line; ( ii) Asn - 117 is predominantly associated with oligomannose - type structures in all cases; ( iii) Asn - 184 and Asn - 448 are predominantly associated with complex - type structures when t - PA is isolated from fibroblast cells, but with both complex - and oligomannose - type structures when isolated from melanoma cells; ( iv) fibroblast cell derived t - PA is associated with both neutral and sialylated oligosaccharides, while melanoma cell derived t - PA is also associated with sulfated oligosaccharides, which are located exclusively at Asn - 448 of type II t - PA; ( v) no complex - type structures occur in common between t - PA from the two cell lines.
