Therefore, the results demonstrate that while FTI - 277 inhibits N - Ras and H - Ras processing in the human tumor cell lines evaluated, inhibition of K - Ras processing requires both an FTase inhibitor as well as a GGTase I inhibitor, and that inhibition of human tumor growth in soft agar does not require inhibition of oncogenic K - Ras processing.
