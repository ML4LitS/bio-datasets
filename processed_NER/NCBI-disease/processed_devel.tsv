BRCA1 is secreted and exhibits properties of a granin.	[]
Germline mutations in BRCA1 are responsible for most cases of inherited breast and ovarian cancer.	"inherited breast and ovarian cancer	62	97	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""inherited breast and ovarian cancer"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
However, the function of the BRCA1 protein has remained elusive.	[]
We now show that BRCA1 encodes a 190 - kD protein with sequence homology and biochemical analogy to the granin protein family.	[]
Interestingly, BRCA2 also includes a motif similar to the granin consensus at the C terminus of the protein.	[]
Both BRCA1 and the granins localize to secretory vesicles, are secreted by a regulated pathway, are post - translationally glycosylated and are responsive to hormones.	[]
As a regulated secretory protein, BRCA1 appears to function by a mechanism not previously described for tumour suppressor gene products..	"tumour	104	110	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Women who carry a mutation in the BRCA1 gene ( on chromosome 17q21), have an 80% risk of breast cancer and a 40% risk of ovarian cancer by the age of 70 ( ref. 1).

The variable penetrance of BRCA1 suggests that other genetic and non - genetic factors play a role in tumourigenesis in these individuals.	[]
The HRAS1 variable number of tandem repeats ( VNTR) polymorphism, located 1 kilobase ( kb) downstream of the HRAS1 proto - oncogene ( chromosome 11p15. 5) is one possible genetic modifier of cancer penetrance.

To investigate whether the presence of rare HRAS1 alleles increases susceptibility to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, we have typed a panel of 307 female BRCA1 carriers at this locus using a PCR - based technique.

Characterisation of the expression of this gene in patient tissues has thus far generated conflicting data on alterations in the steady state levels of DMPK mRNA, and on the final DMPK protein levels in the presence of the expansion.	[]

For improvement over previous studies, a new set of primers has been designed, which allow for amplification of the coding and splicing sequences only.	[]
The positioning of the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) primers was such that the resulting PCR products were of different sizes, which enabled us to analyze two different exons simultaneously and still distinguish between the banding profiles for both ( biplex analysis).	[]
By using this approach, we were able to identify mutation in 22 new patients, but the overall efficiency of the procedure when we used a single - pass regimen was only 48%.	[]

In one family, both alleles were normal in the parents and one sister; thus, the mutation originated de novo in the proposita.	[]
The second patient also had asymptomatic parents who, however, were not available for study.	[]
The structural consequences of the identified mutation, resulting in the CyS2010 - > Arg substitution, were evaluated by expression of the vWF carboxyl - terminal domain containing residues 1366 - 2050.	[]
Insect cells infected with recombinant baculovirus expressing normal vWF sequence secreted a disulfide linked dimeric molecule with an apparent molecular mass of 150 kDa before reduction, yielding a single band of 80 kDa after disulfide bond reduction.	[]
In contrast, cells expressing the mutant fragment secreted a monomeric molecule of apparent molecular mass of 80 kDa, which remained unchanged after reduction.	[]
We conclude that CyS2010 is essential for normal dimerization of vWF subunits through disulfide bonding of carboxyl - terminal domains and that a heterozygous mutation in the corresponding codon is responsible for defective multimer formation in type IID von Willebrand disease..

All but one of the mutations are predicted to give rise to premature translation termination and include seven frameshift insertions or deletions, a nonsense mutation, and a splice acceptor site mutation.	[]
The remaining mutation is a missense mutation ( Cys61Gly) in the zinc - binding motif.	[]
Four novel Swedish founding mutations were identified the nucleotide 2595 deletion A was found in five families, the C 1806 T nonsense mutation in three families, the 3166 insertion TGAGA in three families, and the nucleotide 1201 deletion 11 in two families.	[]
Analysis of the intragenic polymorphism D17S855 supports common origins of the mutations.	[]
Eleven of the 15 kindreds manifesting BRCA1 mutations were breast - ovarian cancer families, several of them with a predominant ovarian cancer phenotype.

Since the isolation of BRCA1 last year, > 65 distinct mutations scattered throughout the coding region have been detected, making analysis of the gene time consuming and technically challenging.	[]
We have developed a multiplex heteroduplex analysis that is designed to analyze one - quarter of the coding sequence in a single - step screening procedure and that will detect approximately 50% of all BRCA1 mutations so far reported in breast / ovarian cancer families.

Previous investigations by Southern blot hybridization and PCR fragment - length analysis had revealed mutations in 48 patients.	[]
Here we report on the analysis of the remaining 71 patients.	[]
By applying heteroduplex analysis, nonisotopic SSCP, and direct sequencing, we detected germ - line mutations resulting in premature termination codons or disruption of splice signals in 51 ( 72%) of the 71 patients.	[]
Four patients also showed rare sequence variants.	[]
No region of the RB1 gene was preferentially involved in single base substitutions.	[]
Recurrent transitions were observed at most of the 14 codons within the RB1.	[]
No mutation was observed in exons 25 - 27, although this region contains two CGA codons.	[]
This suggests that mutations within the 3 - terminal region of the RB1 gene may not be oncogenic.	[]
When these data were combined with the results of our previous investigations, mutations were identified in a total of 99 ( 83%) of 119 patients.	[]
The spectrum comprises 15% large deletions, 26% small length alterations, and 42% base substitutions.	[]
No correlation between the location of frameshift or nonsense mutations and phenotypic features, including age at diagnosis, the number of tumor foci, and manifestation of nonocular tumors was observed..

Most large analyses that defined the limits of the normal and pathological size ranges employed PCR assays, which included the CAG repeats and a CCG repeat tract that was thought to be invariant.	[]
Many of these experiments found an overlap between the normal and disease size ranges.	[]
Subsequent findings that the CCG repeats vary by 8 trinucleotide lengths suggested that the limits of the normal and disease size ranges should be reevaluated with assays that exclude the CCG polymorphism.	[]
Since patients with between 30 and 40 repeats are rare, a consortium was assembled to collect such individuals.	[]
All 178 samples were reanalyzed in Cambridge by using assays specific for the CAG repeats.	[]
We have optimized methods for reliable sizing of CAG repeats and show cases that demonstrate the dangers of using PCR assays that include both the CAG and CCG polymorphisms.	[]

METHODS.	[]
Using a specific radioimmunoassay, we determined colchicine concentrations in the serum and breast milk of 4 patients at various time points, following oral administration of the drug.	[]
The study evaluated 4 patients with FMF who had been taking colchicine on a long - term basis.	"FMF	36	39	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""FMF"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
RESULTS.	[]
Colchicine was found to be excreted in breast milk.	[]
Its levels ranged between 1.	[]
9 and 8.	[]
6 ng / ml, which were similar to those found in the serum ( parallel concentration time curves).	[]
However, there appeared to be a considerable variation in colchicine milk concentration among the different patients, which might be related to individual breast milk composition and, possibly, to other nutritional or metabolic factors.	[]
CONCLUSION.	[]
The extensive peripheral tissue binding and relatively low concentration of colchicine in breast milk suggests that the amount ingested by the infant is small.	[]
Furthermore, based on our clinical experience, nursing appears to be safe for lactating women with FMF who continue to take colchicine.	"FMF	99	102	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""FMF"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Homozygous Brca1 ( 5 - 6) mutant mice die before day 7.	[]
5 of embryogenesis.	[]
Mutant embryos are poorly developed, with no evidence of mesoderm formation.	[]
The extraembryonic region is abnormal, but aggregation with wild - type tetraploid embryos does not rescue the lethality.	[]
In vivo, mutant embryos do not exhibit increased apoptosis but show reduced cell proliferation accompanied by decreased expression of cyclin E and mdm - 2, a regulator of p53 activity.	[]
The expression of cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitor p21 is dramatically increased in the mutant embryos.	[]
Buttressing these in vivo observations is the fact that mutant blastocyst growth is grossly impaired in vitro.	[]
Thus, the death of Brca1 ( 5 - 6) mutant embryos prior to gastrulation may be due to a failure of the proliferative burst required for the development of the different germ layers.	[]

The cholesteryl ester transfer protein ( CETP) mediates the transfer of cholesteryl esters from HDL to other lipoproteins and is a key participant in the reverse transport of cholesterol from the periphery to the liver.	[]
A high prevalence of two different CETP gene mutations ( D442G, 5. 1%; intron 14G A, 0. 5%), was found in 3, 469 men of Japanese ancestry in the Honolulu Heart Program and mutations were associated with decreased CETP ( - 35%) and increased HDL chol levels ( + 10% for D442G).	[]
However, the overall prevalence of definite CHD was 21% in men with mutations and 16% in men without mutations.	"CHD	44	47	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""CHD"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Similar RR values were obtained for the D442G mutation alone.	[]
Increased CHD in men with mutations was primarily observed for HDL chol 41 - 60 mg / dl; for HDL chol > 60 mg / dl men with and without mutations had low CHD prevalence.

Mutation analysis in 19 families of German, Swiss and Turkish descent by single - strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing resulted in the detection of seven novel and 10 known mutations.	[]
A striking clustering of missense mutations in the first four exons contrasted with a random distribution of nonsense mutations.	[]
More than 85% of all known missense mutations were localized in the amino - terminal stretch of the WASP gene product; this region contained a mutational hot spot at codon 86.	[]

To investigate the role of gene dosage in more detail, we have generated yeast artificial chromosome transgenic mice carrying the human PAX6 locus.	[]
When crossed onto the Small eye background, the transgene rescues the mutant phenotype.	[]

Heterodimer formation and activity in the human enzyme galactose - 1 - phosphate uridylyltransferase.	[]
One of the fundamental questions concerning expression and function of dimeric enzymes involves the impact of naturally occurring mutations on subunit assembly and heterodimer activity.	[]
This question is of particular interest for the human enzyme galactose - l - phosphate uridylyl - transferase ( GALT), impairment of which results in the inherited metabolic disorder galactosemia, because many if not most patients studied to date are compound heterozygotes rather than true molecular homozygotes.

Furthermore, the broad range of phenotypic severity observed in these patients raises the possibility that allelic combination, not just allelic constitution, may play some role in determining outcome.	[]
In the work described herein, we have selected two distinct naturally occurring null mutations of GALT, Q188R and R333W, and asked the questions ( i) what are the impacts of these mutations on subunit assembly, and ( ii) if heterodimers do form, are they active?	[]
To answer these questions, we have established a yeast system for the coexpression of epitope - tagged alleles of human GALT and investigated both the extent of specific GALT subunit interactions and the activity of defined heterodimer pools.	[]
We have found that both homodimers and heterodimers do form involving each of the mutant subunits tested and that both heterodimer pools retain substantial enzymatic activity.	[]
These results are significant not only in terms of their implications for furthering our understanding of galactosemia and GALT holoenzyme structure - function relationships but also because the system described may serve as a model for similar studies of other complexes composed of multiple subunits..

The 5 ' end of the BRCA1 gene lies within a duplicated region of human chromosome 17q21.	[]
To begin to address the hypothesis that abnormal regulation of the breast / ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 is a critical step in sporadic breast / ovarian tumorigenesis, we have determined the detailed structure of the BRCA1 genomic region.	"breast / ovarian cancer	67	90	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""breast / ovarian cancer"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
We show that this region of the genome contains a tandem duplication of approximately 30 kilobases, which results in two copies of BRCA1 exons 1 and 2, of exons 1 and 3 of the adjacent 1A1 - 3B gene and of the previously reported 295 base pair intergenic region.	[]
Sequence analysis of the duplicated exons of BRCA1 and 1A1 - 3B and flanking genomic DNA reveals maintenance of the intron - exon structure and a high degree of nucleotide sequence identity, suggesting that these are non - processed pseudogenes and that the duplication is a recent event in evolutionary terms.	[]
We also show that a processed pseudogene of the acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P1 ( ARPP1) is inserted directly upstream of pseudo - BRCA1 exon 1A.	[]
We believe that these findings could not only confound BRCA1 mutation analysis, but could have implications for the normal and abnormal regulation of BRCA1 transcription, translation and function..	[]

In 10 of these families, all the homozygotes have a 137 - bp insertion in their cDNA caused by a point mutation in a sequence resembling a splice - donor site.	[]

We show that the less severe phenotype in these patients is caused by some degree of normal splicing, which occurs as an alternative product from the insertion - containing allele.	[]
The level of the 137 - bp PCR product containing the insertion was lowest in two patients who showed a later onset of cerebellar ataxia.	"cerebellar ataxia	118	135	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cerebellar ataxia"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

To define the possible role of the VHL gene in the development of sporadic renal cell carcinomas, 91 different parenchymal tumours of the kidney have been investigated for mutation of the VHL gene by single strand conformation polymorphism ( SSCP) and / or heteroduplex ( HD) techniques.

In addition, 15 papillary renal cell tumours and ten renal oncocytomas, which are characterized by genetic changes other than loss of chromosome 3p sequences, were analysed for mutation of the VHL gene.

The Emery - Dreifuss muscular dystrophy protein, emerin, is a nuclear membrane protein.	"Emery - Dreifuss muscular dystrophy	4	39	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Emery - Dreifuss muscular dystrophy"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
A large fragment of emerin cDNA was prepared by PCR and expressed as a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli.	[]
Using this as immunogen, we prepared a panel of 12 monoclonal antibodies which recognise at least four different epitopes on emerin in order to ensure that emerin can be distinguished from non - specific cross - reacting proteins.	[]
All the mAbs recognised a 34 kDa protein in all tissues tested, though minor emerin - related bands were also detected in some tissues.	[]
Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that emerin is located at the nuclear rim in all tissues examined.	[]
A muscle biopsy from an Emery - Dreifuss muscular dystrophy ( EMDM) patient showed complete absence of emerin by both Western blotting and immunohistochemistry, suggesting a simple diagnostic antibody test for EDMD families.

Biochemical fractionation of brain and liver tissues showed that emerin was present in nuclei purified by centrifugation through 65% sucrose and was absent from soluble fractions ( post - 100, 000 g).	[]
From these results, together with sequence and structural homologies between emerin, thymopoietins and the nuclear lamina - associated protein, LAP2, we suggest that emerin will prove to be one member of a family of inner nuclear membrane proteins..	[]

Although this microsatellite instability has been attributed to mutations in four DNA mismatch repair genes in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer ( HNPCC) kindreds, many sporadic tumours exhibit instability but no detectable mutations in these genes.

It is therefore of interest to identify other genes that contribute to this instability.	[]
In yeast, mutations in several genes, including RTH and MSH3, cause microsatellite instability.	[]
Thus, we screened 16 endometrial carcinomas with microsatellite instability for alterations in FEN1 ( the human homolog of RTH) and in MSH3 ( refs 12 - 14).	"endometrial carcinomas	21	43	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""endometrial carcinomas"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Although we found no FEN1 mutations, a frameshift mutation in MSH3 was observed in an endometrial carcinoma and in an endometrial carcinoma cell line.

Extracts of the cell line were deficient in repair of DNA substrates containing mismatches or extra nucleotides.	[]
Introducing chromosome 5, encoding the MSH3 gene, into the mutant cell line increased the stability of some but not all microsatellites.	[]
Extracts of these cells repaired certain substrates containing extra nucleotides, but were deficient in repair of those containing mismatches or other extra nucleotides.	[]
A subsequent search revealed a second gene mutation in HHUA cells, a missense mutation in the MSH6 gene.	[]
Together the data suggest that the MSH3 gene encodes a product that functions in repair of some but not all pre - mutational intermediates, its mutation in tumours can result in genomic instability and, as in yeast, MSH3 and MSH6 are partially redundant for mismatch repair..

Atm, Acat1, and Npat, which is a new gene isolated from the AT region, and 12 flanking microsatellite DNA markers were examined.	[]

0 cM distal to D9Mit99 and 1.	[]
3 cM proximal to D9Mit102.	[]
Comparison of the linkage map of mouse chromosome 9 ( MMU9) and that of human chromosome 11 ( HSA11) indicates that there is a chromosomal rearrangement due to an inversion between Ets1 and Atm - Npat - Acat1 and that the inversion of MMU9 originated from the chromosomal breakage at the boundary between Gria4 and Atm - Npat - Acat1 on HSA11.

This type of inversion appeared to be conserved in the three rodent species, mouse, rat, and Syrian hamster, using additional comparative mapping data with the Rck gene	[]

PAX3 codes for a transcriptional regulator that controls developmental programs, and FKHR codes for a forkhead - winged helix protein, also a likely transcription factor.	[]
The PAX3 - FKHR fusion product retains the DNA binding domains of the PAX3 protein and the putative activator domain of the FKHR protein.	[]
The PAX3 - FKHR protein has been shown to function as a transcriptional activator.	[]
Using the RCAS retroviral vector, we have introduced the PAX3 - FKHR gene into chicken embryo fibroblasts.	[]
Expression of the PAX3 - FKHR protein in these cells leads to transformation the cells become enlarged, grow tightly packed and in multiple layers, and acquire the ability for anchorage - independent growth.	[]

Somatic - cell selection is a major determinant of the blood - cell phenotype in heterozygotes for glucose - 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase mutations causing severe enzyme deficiency.

X - chromosome inactivation in mammals is regarded as an essentially random process, but the resulting somatic - cell mosaicism creates the opportunity for cell selection.	[]
In most people with red - blood - cell glucose - 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD) deficiency, the enzyme - deficient phenotype is only moderately expressed in nucleated cells.	[]
However, in a small subset of hemizygous males who suffer from chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia, the underlying mutations ( designated class I) cause more - severe G6PD deficiency, and this might provide an opportunity for selection in heterozygous females during development.

In order to test this possibility we have analyzed four heterozygotes for class I G6PD mutations two with G6PD Portici ( 1178G - - > A) and two with G6PD Bari ( 1187C - - > T).	[]
We found that in fractionated blood cell types ( including erythroid, myeloid, and lymphoid cell lineages) there was a significant excess of G6PD - normal cells.	[]
The significant concordance that we have observed in the degree of imbalance in the different blood - cell lineages indicates that a selective mechanism is likely to operate at the level of pluripotent blood stem cells.	[]
Thus, it appears that severe G6PD deficiency affects adversely the proliferation or the survival of nucleated blood cells and that this phenotypic characteristic is critical during hematopoiesis..

Dual roles of ATM in the cellular response to radiation and in cell growth control.	[]

To elucidate the functions of ATM, we disrupted the mouse ATM gene through homologous recombination in mice.	[]
Consistent with cellular defects of AT patients, the ATM - / - cells are hypersensitive to gamma - irradiation and defective in cell - cycle arrest following radiation, correlating with a defective up - regulation of p53.	"AT	36	38	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AT"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In addition, ATM - / - mouse thymocytes are more resistant to apoptosis induced by gamma - irradiation than normal thymocytes.	[]
ATM - / - fibroblasts are inefficient in G1 to S - phase progression following serum stimulation and senesce after only a few passages in culture.	[]
They have an increased constitutive level of p21CP1 / WAF1.	[]
The ATM protein is therefore critical both for cellular responses to ionizing radiation and for normal cell - cycle progression.	[]
ATM + / - fibroblasts and thymocytes showed intermediately defective responses to irradiation but no growth defect, suggesting that the increased cancer risk of AT heterozygotes could be attributable to poor checkpoint function..

Cloning and characterization of human very - long - chain acyl - CoA dehydrogenase cDNA, chromosomal assignment of the gene and identification in four patients of nine different mutations within the VLCAD gene.	[]
Very - long - chain acyl - CoA dehydrogenase ( VLCAD) is one of four straight - chain acyl - CoA dehydrogenase ( ACD) enzymes, which are all nuclear encoded mitochondrial flavoproteins catalyzing the initial step in fatty acid beta - oxidation.	[]
We have used the very fast, Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends ( RACE) based strategy to obtain the sequence of cDNAs encoding human VLCAD from placenta and fibroblasts.	[]

A defect at the 5 splice donor site of intron 15 of the C6 gene explains the low molecular weight of the C6 protein and is probably responsible for its low expressed concentration.	[]
The C7 defect is more enigmatic the protein is of normal molecular weight, low circulating concentration, and altered isoelectric point.	[]
An Arg > Ser codon substitution in exon 11 is the only molecular alteration within the mature C7 protein.	[]
These defects are associated with a characteristic set of polymorphic DNA markers in the C6 / C7 region, forming a distinct haplotype.	[]
The haplotype has been found in combination with a number of other haplotypes containing defective genes that lead either to C6 or C7 deficiency, but with different consequences.

BACKGROUND & AIMS The chromosome region 18q21 has been shown to be frequently deleted in colorectal cancers, and such frequent allelic loss is a hallmark of the presence of a tumor - suppressor gene.	"colorectal cancers	89	107	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""colorectal cancers"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The DPC4 gene, which is located at 18q21, has been identified as a tumor - suppressor gene from examination of pancreatic cancers.	"pancreatic cancers	111	129	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""pancreatic cancers"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The aim of the present study was to determine if it might also be altered in colorectal cancers.	"colorectal cancers	77	95	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""colorectal cancers"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
METHODS Mutation analyses of the DPC4 gene were performed on complementary DNA samples from 31 primary colorectal cancer specimens using a combination of polymerase chain reaction, single - strand conformation polymorphism, and DNA sequencing.

RESULTS Four missense mutations producing amino acid substitutions and a somatic 12 - base pair deletion in the coding region of the DPC4 gene were detected in the 31 cancers ( 16%; 5 of 31).

CONCLUSIONS The DPC4 gene may play a role as a tumor - suppressor gene in a fraction of colorectal cancers; however, while allelic loss at 18q21 is very often seen in colorectal cancers, only a minority show DPC4 mutations, suggesting that there might be another tumor - suppressor gene in this chromosome region..

These characteristics were observed, however, in both severe and mild cases of the disease.	[]
Similarly, while the cumulative data revealed a predominance of missense mutations among the WASP gene lesions observed in boys with isolated thrombocytopenia, missense mutations were not exclusively associated with milder WAS phenotypes, but also comprised a substantial portion ( 38%) of the WASP gene defects found in patients with severe disease.

We have designed high - density arrays consisting of over 96, 600 oligonucleotides 20 - nucleotides ( nt) in length to screen for a wide range of heterozygous mutations in the 3.	[]
45 - kilobases ( kb) exon 11 of the hereditary breast and ovarian cancer gene BRCA1.	"hereditary breast and ovarian cancer	36	72	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hereditary breast and ovarian cancer"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Reference and test samples were co - hybridized to these arrays and differences in hybridization patterns quantitated by two - colour analysis.	[]
Fourteen of fifteen patient samples with known mutations were accurately diagnosed, and no false positive mutations were identified in 20 control samples.	[]
Eight single nucleotide polymorphisms were also readily detected.	[]
DNA chip - based assays may provide a valuable new technology for high - throughput cost - efficient detection of genetic alterations.	[]

Hereditary hyperparathyroidism - jaw tumor syndrome ( HPT - JT) is an autosomal dominant disease ( OMIM 145001) that has recently been mapped to chromosomal region 1q21 - q32 ( HRPT2).

Here we report two families with HPT - JT syndrome in which adult renal hamartomas or cystic kidney disease were prominent associated features, possibly representing a new phenotypic variant of the HPT - JT syndrome.

In the first family, renal lesions were present in five out of six affected individuals, whereas HPT and JT were seen in four and two cases, respectively.

The possibility of the latter cosegregating as a separate autosomal dominant gene can not be ruled out.	[]

Twenty microsatellite markers in the HRPT2 region were typed, in addition to markers in the multiple endocrine neoplasia ( MEN) types 1 and 2 regions at 11q13 and 10q11.	[]
The disease in these two kindreds was linked to five markers in the 1q21 - q32 region ( logarithm - of - odds scores 3. 2 - 4 2 - 4. 2), whereas linkage to the MEN1 and MEN2 regions was excluded.

Meiotic recombinations detected in affected individuals placed the locus telomeric of D1S215, thus narrowing the HRPT2 region from > 60 to approximately 34 centimorgans.	[]
Loss of heterozygosity was studied in seven renal hamartomas from two affected individuals in the first family, as well as in a jaw tumor and a parathyroid tumor from the second family.

Independent origin of single and double mutations in the human glucose 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase gene.	[]
The vast majority of both polymorphic and sporadic G6PD variants are due to single missense mutations.	[]
In the four polymorphic variants that have two point mutations, one of the mutations is always 376 A - - > G ( 126 Asn - - > Asp), which on its own gives rise to the nondeficient polymorphic variant, G6PD A.	[]
In a study of G6PD deficient patients who presented with clinical favism in Spain, we have found a new polymorphic variant that we have called G6PD Malaga, whose only abnormality is a 542 A - - > T ( 181 Asp - - > Val) mutation.	"G6PD deficient	14	28	Disease/Disorder"	"favism	66	72	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""G6PD deficient"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""favism"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
This is the same mutation as previously found in association with the mutation of G6PD A in the double mutant, G6PD Santamaria.	[]
G6PD Malaga is associated with enzyme deficiency ( class III), and the enzymic properties of G6PD Malaga and G6PD Santamaria are quite similar, indicating that in this case the effects of the two mutations are additive rather than synergistic.	"enzyme deficiency	31	48	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""enzyme deficiency"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
G6PD Santamaria might have been produced by recombination between G6PD A and G6PD Malaga; however haplotype analysis, including the use of a new silent polymorphism, suggests that the same 542 A - - > T mutation has taken place independently in a G6PD B gene to give G6PD Malaga and in a G6PD A gene to give G6PD Santamaria.	[]
These findings help to outline the relationship and evolution of mutations in the human G6PD locus..	[]
BRCA1 R841W: a strong candidate for a common mutation with moderate phenotype.	[]

These are consecutive, population - based cases not selected for age or family history.	[]
In all three cases, there is a strong family history of breast, ovarian, or other cancers possibly related to a BRCA1 defect and family members showed a high concordance of cancer incidence with the presence of R841W.

The Duarte biochemical phenotype has a molecular genotype of N314D / N314D.	[]
"The characteristic Duarte isoform is also associated with a variant called the "" Los Angeles ( LA) phenotype, "" which has increased GALT enzyme activity."	[]
We evaluated GALT enzyme activity and screened the GALT genes of 145 patients with one or more N314D - containing alleles.	[]
We found seven with the LA biochemical phenotype, and all had a 1721C - - > T transition in exon 7 in cis with the N314D missense mutation.	[]
The 1721C - - > T transition is a neutral polymorphism for leucine at amino acid 218 ( L218L).	[]
In pedigree analyses, this 1721C - - > T transition segregated with the LA phenotype of increased GALT activity in three different biochemical phenotypes ( LA / N, LA / G, and LA / D).	[]
To determine the mechanism for increased activity of the LA variant, we compared GALT mRNA, protein abundance, and enzyme thermal stability in lymphoblast cell lines of D and LA phenotypes with comparable genotypes.	[]
GALT protein abundance was increased in LA compared to D alleles, but mRNA was similar among all genotypes.	[]
When LA / D and D / D GALT biochemical phenotypes were compared to N / N GALT phenotypes, both had 50%, as compared to 21%, reduction in GALT activity in the wild type ( N / N) after exposure at identical initial enzyme activity to 50 degrees C for 15 min.	[]
We conclude that the codon change N314D in cis with the base - pair transition 1721C - - > T produces the LA variant of galactosemia and that this nucleotide change increases GALT activity by increasing GALT protein abundance without increasing transcription or decreasing thermal lability.

The ATM protein is a single, high - molecular weight protein predominantly confined to the nucleus of human fibroblasts, but is present in both nuclear and microsomal fractions from human lymphoblast cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes.	[]
ATM protein levels and localization remain constant throughout all stages of the cell cycle.	[]
Truncated ATM protein was not detected in lymphoblasts from ataxia - telangiectasia patients homozygous for mutations leading to premature protein termination.

Exposure of normal human cells to gamma - irradiation and the radiomimetic drug neocarzinostatin had no effect on ATM protein levels, in contrast to a noted rise in p53 levels over the same time interval.	[]
These findings are consistent with a role for the ATM protein in ensuring the fidelity of DNA repair and cell cycle regulation following genome damage..	[]

There are several common polymorphisms in the BRCA1 gene which generate amino acid substitutions.	[]
We have examined the frequency of four of these polymorphisms Gln356Arg, Pro871Leu, Glu1038Gly and Ser1613Gly in large series of breast and ovarian cancer cases and matched controls.

Due to strong linkage disequilibrium, these four sites generate only three haplotypes with a frequency > 1.	[]
3%.	[]
The most common haplotypes, defined by the alleles Gln356Pro871Glu1038Ser1613 and Gln356Leu871Gly1038Gly1613, have frequencies of 0.	[]
57 and 0.	[]
32 respectively, and these frequencies do not differ significantly between patient and control groups.	[]

We determined 48 amino acid residues from five peptides from the homogeneous monomer of homogentisate 1, 2 - dioxygenase ( HGO; E. C. 1. 13. 11. 15) of mouse liver.	[]
After digestion with trypsin, peptides were separated by reversed phase chromatography and amino acid sequenced.	[]
The deduced codon sequence of three peptides was used to derive degenerated oligomeres.	[]
By combining these oligos, we were able to amplify fragments from 100 to 300 bases ( b) from mouse liver cDNA by polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription ( RT - PCR).	[]
A fragment of 200 b was cloned and used as a probe to screen a mouse liver cDNA library.	[]
One clone from this library contained the complete cDNA - insert for HGO as determined by sequencing.	[]
The cDNA encodes for a protein of 50 kDa, as predicted.	[]
The cDNA of mouse HGO has an overall identity of 41% to the corresponding gene hmgA from Aspergillus.	[]
Sequence similarities to human expressed sequence tags ( EST) clones ranged from 70% to 20%.	[]
The positions of 122 conserved amino acids could be determined by multiple sequence alignment.	[]
We identified one first intron of 928 b in the mouse gene.	[]
The gene for HGO seems to be expressed in various tissues, as shown by RT - PCR on different cDNAs.	[]
FISH experiments with the whole murine cDNA as probe clearly revealed signals at the human chromosomal band 3q13.	[]
3 - q21.	[]
This corresponds well to the previous assignment of the locus for the human alkaptonuria gene ( AKU) to the same chromosomal region by multipoint linkage analysis.

Here, we report that a mutation predicting the substitution of Gly 230 by glutamic acid ( G230E) between segments D3 and D4 dramatically alters the pore properties of a recombinant human muscle Cl - channel ( hCIC - 1) expressed in a mammalian cell line ( tsA201).	[]
The G230E mutation causes substantial changes in anion and cation selectivity as well as a fundamental change in rectification of the current - voltage relationship.	[]
Whereas wild - type channels are characterized by pronounced inward rectification and a Cl > thiocyanate > Br > NO ( 3) > I > CH ( 3) SO ( 3) selectivity, G230E exhibits outward rectification at positive potentials and a thiocyanate > NO ( 3) > I > Br > Cl > CH ( 3) SO ( 3) selectivity.	[]
Furthermore, the cation - to - anion permeability ratio of the mutant is much greater than that of the wild - type channel.	[]
Voltage - dependent blocks by intracellular and extracellular iodide help to distinguish two distinct ion binding sites within the hClC - 1 conduction pathway.	[]
Both binding sites are preserved in the mutant but have decreased affinities for iodide.	[]
These findings suggest that Gly 230 is critical for normal ion conductance in hClC - 1 and that this residue resides within the channel pore..	[]
The incidence of PAX6 mutation in patients with simple aniridia: an evaluation of mutation detection in 12 cases.	"aniridia	55	63	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""aniridia"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Twelve aniridia patients, five with a family history and seven presumed to be sporadic, were exhaustively screened in order to test what proportion of people with aniridia, uncomplicated by associated anomalies, carry mutations in the human PAX6 gene.

Mutations were detected in 90% of the cases.	[]
Three mutation detection techniques were used to determine if one method was superior for this gene.	[]
The protein truncation test ( PTT) was used on RT - PCR products, SSCP on genomic PCR amplifications, and chemical cleavage of mismatch on both RT - PCR and genomic amplifications.	[]
For RT - PCR products, only the translated portion of the gene was screened.	[]
On genomic products exons 1 to 13 ( including 740 bp of the 3 untranslated sequence and all intron / exon boundaries) were screened, as was a neuroretina specific enhancer in intron 4.	[]
Ten of the possible 12 mutations in the five familial cases and five of the sporadic patients were found, all of which conformed to a functional outcome of haploinsufficiency.	[]
Five were splice site mutations ( one in the donor site of intron 4, two in the donor site of intron 6, one in each of the acceptor sites of introns 8 and 9) and five were nonsense mutations in exons 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12.	[]
SSCP analysis of individually amplified exons, with which nine of the 10 mutations were seen, was the most useful detection method for PAX6..	[]

The human complement C9 gene: identification of two mutations causing deficiency and revision of the gene structure.	[]
The ninth component of human complement ( C9) is the last of the terminal complement components creating the membrane attack complex.	[]
C9 is a single - chain serum protein that is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 5p.	[]
Deficiency of terminal complement components is generally associated with recurrent neisseria infections.

As a cause of C9 deficiency, we found two different point mutations, both generating TGA stop codons in the coding sequence.	"C9 deficiency	14	27	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""C9 deficiency"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
One mutation, a C to A exchange, was detected in exon 2 at cDNA position 166, the other, a C to T exchange, was located in exon 4 ( cDNA position 464).	[]
In family studies of three first - degree relatives with heterozygous C9 deficiency, we demonstrated that the two mutations are segregating independently.	"C9 deficiency	70	83	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""C9 deficiency"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Therefore, these mutations are sufficient to explain the complete deficiency of both the probands studied.	[]
DNA sequencing of the exon - intron junctions revealed a number of revisions regarding the boundaries between exons 4, 5, and 6 as well as between exons 10 and 11.	[]
No additional introns were detected in exons 6 and 10.	[]
Furthermore, DNA marker studies were conducted using known polymorphisms of the C6, C7, and C9 genes, confirming the linkage of the observed C9 mutations with defined haplotypes..	[]

BACKGROUND To define the incidence of BRCA1 mutations among patients seen in clinics that evaluate the risk of breast cancer, we analyzed DNA samples from women seen in this setting and constructed probability tables to provide estimates of the likelihood of finding a BRCA1 mutation in individual families.	"breast cancer	111	124	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""breast cancer"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
METHODS Clinical information, family histories, and blood for DNA analysis were obtained from 263 women with breast cancer.	"breast cancer	109	122	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""breast cancer"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Conformation - sensitive gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing were used to identify BRCA1 mutations.	[]
RESULTS BRCA1 mutations were identified in 16 percent of women with a family history of breast cancer.	"breast cancer	88	101	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""breast cancer"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Only 7 percent of women from families with a history of breast cancer but not ovarian cancer had BRCA1 mutations.	"breast cancer	56	69	Disease/Disorder"	"ovarian cancer	78	92	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""breast cancer"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""ovarian cancer"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The rates were higher among women from families with a history of both breast and ovarian cancer.	"breast and ovarian cancer	71	96	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""breast and ovarian cancer"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Among family members, an average age of less than 55 years at the diagnosis of breast cancer, the presence of ovarian cancer, the presence of breast and ovarian cancer in the same woman, and Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry were all associated with an increased risk of detecting a BRCA1 mutation.	"breast cancer	79	92	Disease/Disorder"	"ovarian cancer	110	124	Disease/Disorder"	"breast and ovarian cancer	142	167	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""breast cancer"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""ovarian cancer"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""breast and ovarian cancer"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 167, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
No association was found between the presence of bilateral breast cancer or the number of breast cancers in a family and the detection of a BRCA1 mutation, or between the position of the mutation in the BRCA1 gene and the presence of ovarian cancer in a family.	"breast cancer	59	72	Disease/Disorder"	"breast cancers	90	104	Disease/Disorder"	"ovarian cancer	234	248	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""breast cancer"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""breast cancers"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""ovarian cancer"", ""start_span"": 234, ""end_span"": 248, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
CONCLUSIONS Among women with breast cancer and a family history of the disease, the percentage with BRCA1 coding - region mutations is less than the 45 percent predicted by genetic - linkage analysis.	"breast cancer	29	42	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""breast cancer"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
These results suggest that even in a referral clinic specializing in screening women from high - risk families, the majority of tests for BRCA1 mutations will be negative and therefore uninformative..	[]
Mutations in the arginine - rich protein gene ( ARP) in pancreatic cancer.	"pancreatic cancer	56	73	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""pancreatic cancer"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The ARP gene encodes a highly conserved arginine - rich protein from chromosomal band 3p21.	[]
1 1.	[]
At the cytogenetic level this region is frequently deleted in a variety of different solid tumors, although not in pancreatic cancer.	"solid tumors	85	97	Disease/Disorder"	"pancreatic cancer	115	132	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""solid tumors"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""pancreatic cancer"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
We have reported the presence of a specific mutation ( ATG50 - - > AGG) or deletion of codon 50 of the ARP gene in different tumor types ( Shridhar et al., 1996, 1996a).	"tumor types	125	136	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumor types"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In the present study, we have observed mutations involving codon 50 in 11 of 37 pancreatic tumors.	"pancreatic tumors	80	97	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""pancreatic tumors"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The frequency of codon 50 mutation is roughly the same in pancreatic tumors as in the other types of tumors previously examined.	"pancreatic tumors	58	75	Disease/Disorder"	"tumors	69	75	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""pancreatic tumors"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""tumors"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In addition, we have detected mutations at codon 51 in multiple PCR subclones in two other pancreatic tumors.	"pancreatic tumors	91	108	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""pancreatic tumors"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Mutations in the ARP gene are thus commonly observed in pancreatic cancer, as well as many other cancers.

A group of patients with long - surviving mismatched kidney allografts were investigated for complement function using haemolytic assays in agarose gels.	[]
One patient was found to have no alternative pathway activity but a low normal classical pathway.	[]
Surprisingly, investigation revealed that the patients complement was normal for all components except C9, which was functionally absent.	[]
The patient was shown to be heterozygous for DNA markers in the C6, C7 and C9 region of chromosome 5 and therefore appears to be a compound heterozygote for two uncharacterized C9 deficiency genes.

Serological analysis by ELISA revealed that he has trace concentrations of a non - functional C9 molecule.	[]
Western blot analysis was not sufficiently sensitive to permit detection of this molecule.	[]
We hypothesize that the patient is heterozygous for a complete deficiency of C9 and for a gene directing hyposynthesis of a defective C9.	"complete deficiency of C9	54	79	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""complete deficiency of C9"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

In the present study, leukocyte DNA from 143 patients with familial clustering of breast and / or ovarian cancer and tumour DNA from 96 breast carcinomas were screened for base mutations in the estrogen receptor gene ( ESR).

This alteration was also detected in eight ( four females and four males) of 729 controls ( 366 female, 363 males), indicating that the substitution probably represents a polymorphism.	[]
However, in the 229 female controls in whom family history of cancer was known, one of two who had a sister with breast cancer was carrying the variant allele.	"cancer	62	68	Disease/Disorder"	"breast cancer	113	126	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cancer"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""breast cancer"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Hence, a possible clinical significance of the glycine into cysteine cannot be completely ruled out and should be further investigated.	[]
Somatic mutations were not detected in any of the tumours studied, and the present data do not provide support for somatic ESR base mutations as an important mechanism for hormonal therapy resistance in estrogen receptor - positive breast carcinomas..

Exon PCR and sequencing revealed a heterozygous point mutation at the 3 splice acceptor site of intron 1 in one Irish family.	[]
In the other Irish family, exons 7 and 8 failed to amplify and they were shown to be deleted.	[]
Marker haplotype studies of the C6 and C7 gene region and Southern blots show that the Irish family with the splice defect also segregate for the deletion, which is not easily detected in heterozygotes.	[]
The Israeli C7 - deficient cases all share a C7 haplotype and are homozygous for a mis - sense mutation in exon 9.	"C7 - deficient	12	26	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""C7 - deficient"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
However, one individual is heterozygous for markers at adjacent C6 loci, showing that there has been an intergenic recombination and suggesting that the deficiency mutation is of appreciable antiquity..	[]
Molecular heterogeneity of classical and Duarte galactosemia: mutation analysis by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.

Classical galactosemia is caused by one common missense mutation ( Q188R) and by several rare mutations in the galactose - 1 - phosphate uridyltransferase ( GALT) gene.	"Classical galactosemia	0	22	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Classical galactosemia"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The most common variant of GALT, the Duarte variant, occurs as two types, Duarte - 1 ( D - 1) and Duarte - 2 ( D - 2), both of which carry the sequence change N314D.	[]
D - 1 increases, whereas D - 2 decreases GALT activity.	[]
To study the molecular genetics of classical and Duarte galactosemia, we analyzed the GALT mutations in 30 families with classical galactosemia, in 10 families with the D - 2 variant and in 3 individuals carrying the D - 1 allele by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis ( DGGE).	"classical and Duarte galactosemia	35	68	Disease/Disorder"	"classical galactosemia	121	143	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""classical and Duarte galactosemia"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""classical galactosemia"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
DGGE detected 59 of the 60 classical galactosemia alleles.	"galactosemia	37	49	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""galactosemia"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Q188R accounted for 60%, K285N accounted for 28% of these alleles.	[]
Eight novel candidate galactosemia mutations were found.	"galactosemia	22	34	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""galactosemia"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
On all D - 2 alleles N314D occurred in cis with two intronic sequence changes, on the D - 1 alleles in cis with a neutral mutation in exon 7.	[]
We conclude that the mutations causing galactosemia are highly heterogeneous and that K285N is a second common galactosemia mutation in our population..

ATM is a member of the phosphatidylinositol - 3 - kinase superfamily, some of which are protein kinases and appear to have important roles in cell cycle control and radiation signal transduction.	[]
We describe herein, to our knowledge, for the first time, the cloning of a full - length cDNA for ATM and correction of multiple aspects of the radio - sensitive phenotype of A - T cells by transfection with this cDNA.

In the pediatric solid tumor alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, a consistent t ( 2; 13) ( q35; q14) or variant t ( 1; 13) ( p36; q14) translocation generates PAX3 - FKHR or PAX7 - FKHR fusion proteins, respectively.

In this report, we demonstrate that in addition to functional alterations these translocations are associated with fusion product overexpression.	[]
Furthermore, PAX3 - FKHR and PAX7 - FKHR overexpression occurs by distinct mechanisms.	[]
Transcription of PAX3 - FKHR is increased relative to wild - type PAX3 by a copy number - independent process.	[]
In contrast, PAX7 - FKHR overexpression results from fusion gene amplification.	[]
Thus, gene - specific mechanisms were selected to overexpress PAX3 - FKHR and PAX7 - FKHR in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, presumably due to differences in regulation between the wild - type loci.

The two genes are believed to interact in a number of pathways, including regulation of DNA damage - induced cell - cycle checkpoints, apoptosis and radiation sensitivity, and cellular proliferation.	[]
Atm - null mice, as well as those null for p53, develop mainly T - cell lymphomas, supporting the view that these genes have similar roles in thymocyte development.

To study the interactions of these two genes on an organismal level, we bred mice heterozygous for null alleles of both atm and p53 to produce all genotypic combinations.	[]
Mice doubly null for atm and p53 exhibited a dramatic acceleration of tumour formation relative to singly null mice, indicating that both genes collaborate in a significant manner to prevent tumorigenesis.

With respect to their roles in apoptosis, loss of atm rendered thymocytes only partly resistant to irradiation - induced apoptosis, whereas additional loss of p53 engendered complete resistance.	[]
This implies that the irradiation - induced atm and p53 apoptotic pathways are not completely congruent.	[]
Finally - and in contrast to prior predictions - atm and p53 do not appear to interact in acute radiation toxicity, suggesting a separate atm effector pathway for this DNA damage response and having implications for the prognosis and treatment of human tumours..

Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that a DNase l - hypersensitive site located adjacent to the repeats on the wild - type allele is eliminated by repeat expansion, indicating that large CTG - repeat arrays may be associated with a local chromatin environment that represses gene expression.	[]
Here we report that the hypersensitive site contains an enhancer element that regulates transcription of the adjacent DMAHP homeobox gene.	[]
Analysis of DMAHP expression in the cells of DM patients with loss of the hypersensitive site revealed a two - to fourfold reduction in steady - state DMAHP transcript levels relative to wild - type controls.

Allele - specific analysis of DMAHP expression showed that steady - state transcript levels from the expanded allele were greatly reduced in comparison to those from the wild - type allele.	[]
Together, these results demonstrate that CTG - repeat expansions can suppress local gene expression and implicate DMAHP in DM pathogenesis.	"DM	114	116	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""DM"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Constitutively methylated CpG dinucleotides as mutation hot spots in the retinoblastoma gene ( RB1).	"retinoblastoma	73	87	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""retinoblastoma"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
A wide spectrum of mutations, ranging from point mutations to large deletions, have been described in the retinoblastoma gene ( RB1).	"retinoblastoma	106	120	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""retinoblastoma"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Mutations have been found throughout the gene; however, these genetic alterations do not appear to be homogeneously distributed.	[]
In particular, a significant proportion of disease - causing mutations results in the premature termination of protein synthesis, and the majority of these mutations occur as C - - > T transitions at CpG dinucleotides ( CpGs).	[]
Such recurrent CpG mutations, including those found in RB1, are likely the result of the deamination of 5 - methylcytosine within these CpGs.	[]
In the present study, we used the sodiumbisulfite conversion method to detect cytosine methylation in representative exons of RB1.	[]
We analyzed DNA from a variety of tissues and specifically targeted CGA codons in RB1, where recurrent premature termination mutations have been reported.	[]
We found that DNA methylation within RB1 exons 8, 14, 25, and 27 appeared to be restricted to CpGs, including six CGA codons.	[]
Other codons containing methylated cytosines have not been reported to be mutated.	[]
Therefore, disease - causing mutations at CpGs in RB1 appear to be determined by several factors, including the constitutive presence of DNA methylation at cytosines within CpGs, the specific codon within which the methylated cytosine is located, and the particular region of the gene within which that codon resides..

The von Hippel - Lindau tumor suppressor gene product interacts with Sp1 to repress vascular endothelial growth factor promoter activity.

The von Hippel - Lindau tumor suppressor gene ( VHL) has a critical role in the pathogenesis of clear - cell renal cell carcinoma ( RCC), as VHL mutations have been found in both von Hippel - Lindau disease - associated and sporadic RCCs.

We have therefore assessed the effect of the VHL gene product on VEGF expression.	[]
VEGF promoter - luciferase constructs were transiently cotransfected with a wild - type VHL ( wt - VHL) vector in several cell lines, including 293 embryonic kidney and RCC cell lines.	"RCC	169	172	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""RCC"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 172, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
wt - VHL protein inhibited VEGF promoter activity in a dose - dependent manner up to 5 - to 10 - fold.	[]
Deletion analysis defined a 144 - bp region of the VEGF promoter necessary for VHL repression.	[]
This VHL - responsive element is GC rich and specifically binds the transcription factor Sp1 in crude nuclear extracts.	[]
In Drosophila cells, cotransfected VHL represses Sp1 - mediated activation but not basal activity of the VEGF promoter.	[]
We next demonstrated in coimmunoprecipitates that VHL and Sp1 were part of the same complex and, by using a glutathione - S - transferase - VHL fusion protein and purified Sp1, that VHL and Sp1 directly interact.	[]
Furthermore, endogenous VEGF mRNA levels were suppressed in permanent RCC cell lines expressing wt - VHL, and nuclear run - on studies indicated that VHL regulation of VEGF occurs at least partly at the transcriptional level.	"RCC	70	73	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""RCC"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
These observations support a new mechanism for VHL - mediated transcriptional repression via a direct inhibitory action on Sp1 and suggest that loss of Sp1 inhibition may be important in the pathogenesis of von Hippel - Lindau disease and RCC..

We identified three missense mutations ( I66M, G270D, L618S) and one exon - 6 skipping ( 535 - 573del).	[]
Two of the patients had only the I66M mutant mRNA, and one only the G27OD mutant mRNA.	[]
The fourth patient carried a compound heterozygous mutation of 535 - 573del and L618S.	[]
To determine the enzymatic activities produced by these mutations, we constructed mutated GALC cDNAs and expressed them in COS - 1 cells.	[]
Three mutations, viz., G270D, L618S, and exon - 6 skipping ( 535 - 573del), produced diminished GALC activity as expected.	"diminished GALC activity	85	109	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""diminished GALC activity"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The I66M mutation in the wild - type GALC cDNA ( I289) had normal activity, but when this mutation and the V289 polymorphism were introduced into the same allele, it had decreased activity.	[]
Thus, the combination of a unique mutation and polymorphism causes conformational change in the GALC enzyme, resulting in low enzymatic activity.	[]
AO - GLD mutations, including those found here, are located in the N - terminus ( I66M, G270D, 535 - 573del) or C - terminus ( L618S) of the GALC enzyme, whereas the reported mutations in the infantile form ( IF - GLD) are in the central domain.
