By analysing tumour DNA from patients with sporadic T - cell prolymphocytic leukaemia ( T - PLL), a rare clonal malignancy with similarities to a mature T - cell leukaemia seen in A - T, we demonstrate a high frequency of ATM mutations in T - PLL.

In marked contrast to the ATM mutation pattern in A - T, the most frequent nucleotide changes in this leukaemia were missense mutations.

These clustered in the region corresponding to the kinase domain, which is highly conserved in ATM - related proteins in mouse, yeast and Drosophila.	[]
The resulting amino - acid substitutions are predicted to interfere with ATP binding or substrate recognition.	[]
Two of seventeen mutated T - PLL samples had a previously reported A - T allele.

Occasional missense mutations in ATM were also found in tumour DNA from patients with B - cell non - Hodgkins lymphomas ( B - NHL) and a B - NHL cell line.

The evidence of a significant proportion of loss - of - function mutations and a complete absence of the normal copy of ATM in the majority of mutated tumours establishes somatic inactivation of this gene in the pathogenesis of sporadic T - PLL and suggests that ATM acts as a tumour suppressor.

Myotonic dystrophy protein kinase is involved in the modulation of the Ca2 + homeostasis in skeletal muscle cells.	"Myotonic dystrophy	0	18	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Myotonic dystrophy"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Myotonic dystrophy ( DM), the most prevalent muscular disorder in adults, is caused by ( CTG) n - repeat expansion in a gene encoding a protein kinase ( DM protein kinase; DMPK) and involves changes in cytoarchitecture and ion homeostasis.	"Myotonic dystrophy	0	18	Disease/Disorder"	"DM	21	23	Disease/Disorder"	"muscular disorder	45	62	Disease/Disorder"	"DM	21	23	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Myotonic dystrophy"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""DM"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""muscular disorder"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""DM"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
To obtain clues to the normal biological role of DMPK in cellular ion homeostasis, we have compared the resting [ Ca2 +] i, the amplitude and shape of depolarization - induced Ca2 + transients, and the content of ATP - driven ion pumps in cultured skeletal muscle cells of wild - type and DMPK [ - / -] knockout mice.	[]
In vitro - differentiated DMPK [ - / -] myotubes exhibit a higher resting [ Ca2 +] i than do wild - type myotubes because of an altered open probability of voltage - dependent l - type Ca2 + and Na + channels.	[]
The mutant myotubes exhibit smaller and slower Ca2 + responses upon triggering by acetylcholine or high external K +.	[]
In addition, we observed that these Ca2 + transients partially result from an influx of extracellular Ca2 + through the l - type Ca2 + channel.	[]
Neither the content nor the activity of Na + / K + ATPase and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2 + - ATPase are affected by DMPK absence.	[]
In conclusion, our data suggest that DMPK is involved in modulating the initial events of excitation - contraction coupling in skeletal muscle..	[]

To determine the frequency and nature of constitutional RB1 - gene mutations in patients with isolated unilateral retinoblastoma, we analyzed DNA from peripheral blood and from tumor tissue.

The analysis of tumors from 54 ( 71%) of 76 informative patients showed loss of constitutional heterozygosity ( LOH) at intragenic loci.	"tumors	16	22	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumors"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Three of 13 uninformative patients had constitutional deletions.	[]
For 39 randomly selected tumors, SSCP, hetero - duplex analysis, sequencing, and Southern blot analysis were used to identify mutations.	"tumors	25	31	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumors"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Mutations were detected in 21 ( 91%) of 23 tumors with LOH.	"tumors	43	49	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumors"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In 6 ( 38%) of 16 tumors without LOH, one mutation was detected, and in 9 ( 56%) of the tumors without LOH, both mutations were found.

Thus, a total of 45 mutations were identified in tumors of 36 patients.	"tumors	49	55	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumors"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Thirty - nine of the mutations - including 34 small mutations, 2 large structural alterations, and hypermethylation in 3 tumors - were not detected in the corresponding peripheral blood DNA.	[]
In 6 ( 17%) of the 36 patients, a mutation was detected in constitutional DNA, and 1 of these mutations is known to be associated with reduced expressivity.	[]
The presence of a constitutional mutation was not associated with an early age at treatment.	[]
In 1 patient, somatic mosaicism was demonstrated by molecular analysis of DNA and RNA from peripheral blood.	[]
In 2 patients without a detectable mutation in peripheral blood, mosaicism was suggested because 1 of the patients showed multifocal tumors and the other later developed bilateral retinoblastoma.

In specific C5 titrations, however, it was noted that when limited amounts of C5 were assayed in the presence of low dilutions of either C5D serum, curving rather than linear dose - response plots were consistently obtained, suggesting some inhibitory effect.

Clinical and radiographic examinations were performed to establish diagnoses, and disease severity was assessed using a combination of validated scoring systems.	[]
HLA typing for HLA - B27, HLA - B60, and HLA - DR1 was performed by polymerase chain reaction with sequence - specific primers, and zygosity was assessed using microsatellite markers.	[]
Genetic and environmental variance components were assessed with the program Mx, using data from this and previous studies of twins with AS.	"AS	137	139	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AS"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
RESULTS Six of 8 monozygotic ( MZ) twin pairs were disease concordant, compared with 4 of 15 B27 - positive dizygotic ( DZ) twin pairs ( 27%) and 4 of 32 DZ twin pairs overall ( 12. 5%).	[]
Nonsignificant increases in similarity with regard to age at disease onset and all of the disease severity scores assessed were noted in disease - concordant MZ twins compared with concordant DZ twins.	[]
HLA - B27 and B60 were associated with the disease in probands, and the rate of disease concordance was significantly increased among DZ twin pairs in which the co - twin was positive for both B27 and DR1.	[]
Additive genetic effects were estimated to contribute 97% of the population variance.	[]

Cell cycle - dependent colocalization of BARD1 and BRCA1 proteins in discrete nuclear domains.	[]
Germ - line mutations of the BRCA1 gene predispose women to early - onset breast and ovarian cancer by compromising the genes presumptive function as a tumor suppressor.

Although the biochemical properties of BRCA1 polypeptides are not understood, their expression pattern and subcellular localization suggest a role in cell - cycle regulation.	[]
When resting cells are induced to proliferate, the steady - state levels of BRCA1 increase in late G1 and reach a maximum during S phase.	[]
"Moreover, in S phase cells, BRCA1 polypeptides are hyperphosphorylated and accumulate into discrete subnuclear foci termed "" BRCA1 nuclear dots."	[]
""" BRCA1 associates in vivo with a structurally related protein termed BARD1."	[]
Here we show that the steady - state levels of BARD1, unlike those of BRCA1, remain relatively constant during cell cycle progression.	[]
However, immunostaining revealed that BARD1 resides within BRCA1 nuclear dots during S phase of the cell cycle, but not during the G1 phase.	[]
Nevertheless, BARD1 polypeptides are found exclusively in the nuclear fractions of both G1 - and S - phase cells.	[]
Therefore, progression to S phase is accompanied by the aggregation of nuclear BARD1 polypeptides into BRCA1 nuclear dots.	[]
This cell cycle - dependent colocalization of BARD1 and BRCA1 indicates a role for BARD1 in BRCA1 - mediated tumor suppression.	"tumor	109	114	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumor"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Mutational analysis of COL17A1 identified a maternally inherited G - to - T transversion at the - 1 position of exon 32.	[]
This acceptor splice - site mutation led to the formation of aberrant transcripts present at extremely low levels.	[]
Based on our recent finding that cycloheximide stabilized mutant COL17A1 transcripts in keratinocytes homozygous for a frameshift mutation, the effects of the splice - site mutation on splicing of COL17A1 transcripts were determined using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of total RNA from keratinocytes incubated for 2.	[]
5 h in the presence or absence of 10 microg cycloheximide per ml.	[]
Using this approach, an abnormally spliced transcript was identified that contains an extra 264 bases upstream from exon 32, resulting in a premature termination codon 27 bp downstream from the cryptic splice site.	[]
Three other splice variants, including one derived from the skipping of exon 32, were also identified.	[]
These results indicate the usefulness of cycloheximide treatment in evaluating the abnormal processing of mRNA due to splice - site mutations, because ( i) aberrant splicing often generates a premature termination codon, ( ii) transcripts with premature termination codons can occur at low or undetectable levels due to nonsense - mediated mRNA decay, and ( iii) the levels of these transcripts can be increased by cycloheximide.

Affected individuals in three families are homozygous for 4003delTC, whereas those in two others are compound heterozygotes.	[]
To determine if the occurrence of 4003delTC in these unrelated families signifies propagation of an ancestral allele or a mutational hot spot, haplotypes were determined for polymorphisms both within and flanking COL17A1.	[]
Five intragenic polymorphisms were chosen based on their informativeness.	[]
One of these, not previously reported, was 2988 A or C that introduces a new restriction site for Eco0109 I.	[]
All the 4003delTC alleles showed the same haplotype for these five polymorphic markers.	[]
Fourteen microsatellite polymorphisms were selected based on their high heterozygosity and their location within 10q23 - q25 near COL17A1.	[]
Three families shared microsatellite polymorphisms covering at most 19 cM, whereas the others shared smaller regions consistent with cross - over events during passage of this mutation through several generations.	[]

The gene product, a member of the major histocompatibility complex class I - like family, was found to have a mutation, Cys - 282 - - > Tyr ( C282Y), in 85% of patient chromosomes.	[]
This mutation eliminates the ability of HFE to associate with beta2 - microglobulin ( beta2m) and prevents cell - surface expression.	[]
A second mutation that has no effect on beta2m association, H63D, was found in eight out of nine patients heterozygous for the C282Y mutant.	[]
In this report, we demonstrate in cultured 293 cells overexpressing wild - type or mutant HFE proteins that both the wild - type and H63D HFE proteins form stable complexes with the transferrin receptor ( TfR).	[]
The C282Y mutation nearly completely prevents the association of the mutant HFE protein with the TfR.	[]
Studies on cell - associated transferrin at 37 degrees C suggest that the overexpressed wild - type HFE protein decreases the affinity of the TfR for transferrin.	[]
The overexpressed H63D protein does not have this effect, providing the first direct evidence for a functional consequence of the H63D mutation.	[]
Addition of soluble wild - type HFE / beta2m heterodimers to cultured cells also decreased the apparent affinity of the TfR for its ligand under steady - state conditions, both in 293 cells and in HeLa cells.	[]
Furthermore, at 4 degrees C, the added soluble complex of HFE / beta2m inhibited binding of transferrin to HeLa cell TfR in a concentration - dependent manner.	[]
Scatchard plots of these data indicate that the added heterodimer substantially reduced the affinity of TfR for transferrin.	[]
These results establish a molecular link between HFE and a key protein involved in iron transport, the TfR, and raise the possibility that alterations in this regulatory mechanism may play a role in the pathogenesis of hereditary hemochromatosis..

Previous UBE3A cDNA analysis has shown a coding region of approximately 2.	[]
6 kb and a 3 - untranslated region ( UTR) of < 50 bp, whereas Northern analysis has indicated mRNA sizes of 5 - 8 kb.	[]
We have analyzed additional cDNA clones and provide evidence for an additional 0.	[]
5 kb of 5 - UTR and > 2 kb of 3 - UTR.	[]
We have established the genomic organization of UBE3A and the sequence of intron - exon borders.	[]
We have also mapped two highly homologous processed pseudogenes, UBE3AP1 and UBE3AP2, to chromosomes 2 and 21, respectively, and determined their genomic organization.	[]
These results will form the basis for studies of mutation and imprinting of UBE3A.	[]

In addition, PTEN was identified as the susceptibility gene for two hamartoma syndromes Cowden disease ( CD; MIM 158350) and Bannayan - Zonana ( BZS) or Ruvalcaba - Riley - Smith syndrome ( MIM 153480).

Constitutive DNA from 37 CD families and seven BZS families was screened for germline PTEN mutations.

PTEN mutations were identified in 30 of 37 ( 81%) CD families, including missense and nonsense point mutations, deletions, insertions, a deletion / insertion and splice site mutations.	"CD	50	52	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""CD"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
These mutations were scattered over the entire length of PTEN, with the exception of the first, fourth and last exons.	[]
A hot spot for PTEN mutation in CD was identified in exon 5 that contains the PTPase core motif, with 13 of 30 ( 43%) CD mutations identified in this exon.	"CD	32	34	Disease/Disorder"	"CD	32	34	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""CD"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""CD"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Seven of 30 ( 23%) were within the core motif, the majority ( five of seven) of which were missense mutations, possibly pointing to the functional significance of this region.	[]
Germline PTEN mutations were identified in four of seven ( 57%) BZS families studied.	"BZS	64	67	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""BZS"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Interestingly, none of these mutations was observed in the PTPase core motif.	[]
It is also worthy of note that a single nonsense point mutation, R233X, was observed in the germline DNA from two unrelated CD families and one BZS family.	"CD	124	126	Disease/Disorder"	"BZS	144	147	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""CD"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""BZS"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 147, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Genotype - phenotype studies were not performed on this small group of BZS families.	"BZS	71	74	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""BZS"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
However, genotype - phenotype analysis inthe group of CD families revealed two possible associations worthy of follow - up in independent analyses.	"CD	54	56	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""CD"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The first was an association noted in the group of CD families with breast disease.

A correlation was observed between the presence / absence of a PTEN mutation and the type of breast involvement ( unaffected versus benign versus malignant).	[]
Specifically and more directly, an association was also observed between the presence of a PTEN mutation and malignant breast disease.	"malignant breast disease	109	133	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""malignant breast disease"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Secondly, there appeared to be an interdependent association between mutations upstream and within the PTPase core motif, the core motif containing the majority of missense mutations, and the involvement of all major organ systems ( central nervous system, thyroid, breast, skin and gastrointestinal tract).	[]
However, these observations would need to be confirmed by studying a larger number of CD families.	"CD	86	88	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""CD"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Complement component C6 deficiency ( C6D) was diagnosed in a 16 - year - old African - American male with meningococcal meningitis.

The patients father and two brothers also had C6D, but gave no history of meningitis or other neisserial infection.

By using exon - specific polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) / single - strand conformation polymorphism as a screening step and nucleotide sequencing of target exons, we determined that the proband was a compound heterozygote for two C6 gene mutations.	[]
The first, 1195delC located in exon 7, is a novel mutation, while the second, 1936delG in exon 12, has been described before to cause C6D in an unrelated African - American individual.	"C6D	134	137	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""C6D"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Both mutations result in premature termination codons and C6 null alleles.	[]
Allele - specific PCR indicated that the probands two brothers also inherited the 1195delC mutation from their heterozygous mother and the 1936delG mutation from their homozygous father..	[]
PAX6 mutations reviewed.	[]
Mutations in PAX6 are responsible for human aniridia and have also been found in patients with Peters anomaly, with congenital cataracts, with autosomal dominant keratitis, and with isolated foveal hypoplasia.

No locus other than chromosome 11p13 has been implicated in aniridia, and PAX6 is clearly the major, if not only, gene responsible.	"aniridia	60	68	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""aniridia"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Twenty - eight percent of identified PAX6 mutations are C - T changes at CpG dinucleotides, 20% are splicing errors, and more than 30% are deletion or insertion events.	[]
There is a noticeably elevated level of mutation in the paired domain compared with the rest of the gene.	[]
Increased mutation in the homeodomain is accounted for by the hypermutable CpG dinucleotide in codon 240.	[]
Very nearly all mutations appear to cause loss of function of the mutant allele, and more than 80% of exonic substitutions result in nonsense codons.	[]
In a gene with such extraordinarily high sequence conservation throughout evolution, there are presumed undiscovered missense mutations, these are hypothesized to exist in as - yet unidentified phenotypes..	[]
Genetic heterogeneity and penetrance analysis of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in breast cancer families.	"breast cancer	78	91	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""breast cancer"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

The contribution of BRCA1 and BRCA2 to inherited breast cancer was assessed by linkage and mutation analysis in 237 families, each with at least four cases of breast cancer, collected by the Breast Cancer Linkage Consortium.	"inherited breast cancer	39	62	Disease/Disorder"	"breast cancer	49	62	Disease/Disorder"	"Breast Cancer	191	204	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""inherited breast cancer"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""breast cancer"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""Breast Cancer"", ""start_span"": 191, ""end_span"": 204, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Families were included without regard to the occurrence of ovarian or other cancers.	"ovarian or other cancers	59	83	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ovarian or other cancers"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Overall, disease was linked to BRCA1 in an estimated 52% of families, to BRCA2 in 32% of families, and to neither gene in 16% ( 95% confidence interval [ CI] 6% - 28%), suggesting other predisposition genes.	[]
The majority ( 81%) of the breast - ovarian cancer families were due to BRCA1, with most others ( 14%) due to BRCA2.	"breast - ovarian cancer	27	50	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""breast - ovarian cancer"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Conversely, the majority of families with male and female breast cancer were due to BRCA2 ( 76%).	"male and female breast cancer	42	71	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""male and female breast cancer"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The largest proportion ( 67%) of families due to other genes was found in families with four or five cases of female breast cancer only.	"breast cancer	117	130	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""breast cancer"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
These estimates were not substantially affected either by changing the assumed penetrance model for BRCA1 or by including or excluding BRCA1 mutation data.	[]
Among those families with disease due to BRCA1 that were tested by one of the standard screening methods, mutations were detected in the coding sequence or splice sites in an estimated 63% ( 95% CI 51% - 77%).	[]
The estimated sensitivity was identical for direct sequencing and other techniques.	[]
The penetrance of BRCA2 was estimated by maximizing the LOD score in BRCA2 - mutation families, over all possible penetrance functions.	[]
The estimated cumulative risk of breast cancer reached 28% ( 95% CI 9% - 44%) by age 50 years and 84% ( 95% CI 43% - 95%) by age 70 years.	"breast cancer	33	46	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""breast cancer"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

4% ( 95% CI 0% - 1%) by age 50 years and 27% ( 95% CI 0% - 47%) by age 70 years.	[]
The lifetime risk of breast cancer appears similar to the risk in BRCA1 carriers, but there was some suggestion of a lower risk in BRCA2 carriers < 50 years of age.

The percentage of errors in antisaccades was greatly increased and was significantly correlated with age at disease onset.	[]
In addition, a correlation between smooth pursuit gain and the number of trinucleotide repeats was found.	[]

Three major criteria, saccade amplitude, saccade velocity, and presence of gaze - evoked nystagmus, permitted the correct assignment of 90% of the SCA1, 90% of the SCA2, and 93% of the patients with SCA3 to their genetically confirmed patient group and, therefore, may help orient diagnoses of SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3 at early clinical stages of the diseases..

The relatively high residual GALNS activity seen when the T312S mutant cDNA is overexpressed in mutant cells provides an explanation for the mild phenotype in patients with this mutation.	[]
The distribution and relative frequencies of the I113F and T312S mutations in Australia corresponded to those observed in Northern Ireland and are unique to these two populations, suggesting that both mutations were probably introduced to Australia by Irish migrants during the 19th century.	[]
Haplotype analysis using 6 RFLPs provides additional data that the I113F mutation originated from a common ancestor.	[]
The other 9 novel mutations identified in these 23 patients were each limited to a single family.	[]
These data provide further evidence for extensive allelic heterogeneity in MPS IVA in British - Irish patients and provide evidence for their transmission to Australia by British - Irish migrants..

We extended our analysis to other non - Ashkenazi subsets 354 of Moroccan origin, 200 Yemenites and 150 Iranian Jews.	[]
Heteroduplex analysis complemented by direct DNA sequencing of abnormally migrating bands were employed.	[]
Four of Moroccan origin ( 1. 1%) and none of the Yemenites or Iranians was a carrier of the 185delAG mutation.	[]
BRCA1 allelic patterns were determined for four of these individuals and for 12 additional non - Ashkenazi 185delAG mutation carriers who had breast / ovarian cancer.

Six non - Ashkenazi individuals shared the common Ashkenazi haplotype, four had a closely related pattern, and the rest ( n = 6) displayed a distinct BRCA1 allelic pattern.	[]
We conclude that the 185delAG BRCA1 mutation occurs in some non - Ashkenazi populations at rates comparable with that of Ashkenazim.	[]
The majority of Jewish 185delAG mutation carriers have a common allelic pattern, supporting the founder effect notion, but dating the mutations origin to an earlier date than currently estimated.	[]
However, the different allelic pattern at the BRCA1 locus even in some Jewish mutation carriers, might suggest that the mutation arose independently..	[]

By protein - truncation test ( PTT) assay, the entire coding region of the APC gene was screened in affected individuals from 11 AAPC kindreds, and their phenotypic differences were examined.

In males, SF - 1 participates in sexual development by regulating expression of the polypeptide hormone Mullerian inhibiting substance ( MIS).	[]
Here, we show that WT1 - KTS isoforms associate and synergize with SF - 1 to promote MIS expression.	[]
In contrast, WT1 missense mutations, associated with male pseudohermaphroditism in Denys - Drash syndrome, fail to synergize with SF - 1.

Additionally, the X - linked, candidate dosage - sensitive sex - reversal gene, Dax - 1, antagonizes synergy between SF - 1 and WT1, most likely through a direct interaction with SF - 1.	[]

Imprinting in the 15q11 - q13 region involves an imprinting centre ( IC), mapping in part to the promoter and first exon of SNRPN.	[]
Deletion of this IC abolishes local paternally derived gene expression and results in Prader - Willi syndrome ( PWS).

Mice harbouring an intragenic deletion in Snrpn are phenotypically normal, suggesting that mutations of SNRPN are not sufficient to induce PWS.	"PWS	139	142	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""PWS"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Mice with a larger deletion involving both Snrpn and the putative PWS - IC lack expression of the imprinted genes Zfp127 ( mouse homologue of ZNF127), Ndn and Ipw, and manifest several phenotypes common to PWS infants.

In order to define the types of disease - causing ATM mutations in Japanese A - T patients as well as to look for possible mutational hotspots, reverse - transcribed RNA derived from ten patients belonging to eight unrelated Japanese A - T families was analyzed for mutations by the restriction endonuclease fingerprinting method.

As has been reported by others, mutations that lead to exon skipping or premature protein truncation were also predominant in our mutants.	[]
Six different mutations were identified on 12 of the 16 alleles examined.	[]
Four were deletions involving a loss of a single exon exon 7, exon 16, exon 33 or exon 35.	[]
The others were minute deletions, 4649delA in exon 33 and 7883del5 in exon 55.	[]
The mutations 4612del165 and 7883del5 were found in more than two unrelated families; 44% ( 7 of 16) of the mutant alleles had one of the two mutations.	[]
The 4612del165 mutations in three different families were all ascribed to the same T - - > A substitution at the splice donor site in intron 33.	[]
Microsatellite genotyping around the ATM locus also indicated that a common haplotype was shared by the mutant alleles in both mutations.	[]
This suggests that these two founder mutations may be predominant among Japanese ATM mutant alleles.	[]
W474C amino acid substitution affects early processing of the alpha - subunit of beta - hexosaminidase A and is associated with subacute G ( M2) gangliosidosis.	[]
Mutations in the HEXA gene, encoding the alpha - subunit of beta - hexosaminidase A ( Hex A), that abolish Hex A enzyme activity cause Tay - Sachs disease ( TSD), the fatal infantile form of G ( M2) gangliosidosis, Type 1.

Less severe, subacute ( juvenile - onset) and chronic ( adult - onset) variants are characterized by a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations and are associated with residual levels of Hex A enzyme activity.	[]
We identified a 1422 G - - > C ( amino acid W474C) substitution in the first position of exon 13 of HEXA of a non - Jewish proband who manifested a subacute variant of G ( M2) gangliosidosis.	[]
On the second maternally inherited allele, we identified the common infantile disease - causing 4 - bp insertion, + TATC 1278, in exon 11.	[]
Pulse - chase analysis using proband fibroblasts revealed that the W474C - containing alpha - subunit precursor was normally synthesized, but not phosphorylated or secreted, and the mature lysosomal alpha - subunit was not detected.	[]
When the W474C - containing alpha - subunit was transiently co - expressed with the beta - subunit to produce Hex A ( alphabeta) in COS - 7 cells, the mature alpha - subunit was present, but its level was much lower than that from normal alpha - subunit transfections, although higher than in those cells transfected with an alpha - subunit associated with infantile TSD.	"TSD	367	370	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""TSD"", ""start_span"": 367, ""end_span"": 370, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Furthermore, the precursor level of the W474C alpha - subunit was found to accumulate in comparison to the normal alpha - subunit precursor levels.	[]
We conclude that the 1422 G - - > C mutation is the cause of Hex A enzyme deficiency in the proband.	"Hex A enzyme deficiency	61	84	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Hex A enzyme deficiency"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The resulting W474C substitution clearly interferes with alpha - subunit processing, but because the base substitution falls at the first position of exon 13, aberrant splicing may also contribute to Hex A deficiency in this proband..

The insertion was a 5 - truncated form of human L1 inversely integrated in the 5 - untranslated region in the muscle exon 1, which affected the transcription or the stability of the muscle form of dystrophin transcripts but not that of the brain or Purkinje cell form, probably due to its unique site of integration.

We identified both causative mutations in 686 patients from seven European centers.	[]
On the basis of the phenotypic characteristics of 297 functionally hemizygous patients, 105 of the mutations were assigned to one of four arbitrary phenotype categories.	[]

Among the seven contributing centers, the proportion of patients for whom the observed phenotype did not match the predicted phenotype was 4% - 23% ( P <. 0001), suggesting that differences in methods used for mutation detection or phenotype classification may account for a considerable proportion of genotype - phenotype inconsistencies.

However, several truncation mutations have been found to occur in the C - terminal half of PAX6 in patients with Aniridia resulting in mutant proteins that retain the DNA - binding domains but have lost most of the transactivation domain.

It is not clear whether such mutants really behave as loss - of - function mutants as predicted by haploinsufficiency.	[]
Contrary to this theory, our data showed that these mutants are dominant - negative in transient transfection assays when they are coexpressed with wild - type PAX6.	[]
We found that the dominant - negative effects result from the enhanced DNA binding ability of these mutants.	[]
Kinetic studies of binding and dissociation revealed that various truncation mutants have 3 - 5 - fold higher affinity to various DNA - binding sites when compared with the wild - type PAX6.	[]

The gene, termed low - density lipoprotein receptor related protein 5 ( LRP5), encodes a protein of 1615 amino acids that contains conserved modules which are characteristic of the low - density lipoprotein ( LDL) receptor family.	[]
These modules include a putative signal peptide for protein export, four epidermal growth factor ( EGF) repeats with associated spacer domains, three LDL - receptor ( LDLR) repeats, a single transmembrane spanning domain, and a cytoplasmic domain.	[]
The encoded protein has a unique organization of EGF and LDLR repeats; therefore, LRP5 likely represents a new category of the LDLR family.	[]
Both human and mouse LRP5 cDNAs have been isolated and the encoded mature proteins are 95% identical, indicating a high degree of evolutionary conservation..	[]

BRCA1 and BRCA2 account for most cases of familial, early onset breast and / or ovarian cancer and encode products that each interact with hRAD51.

Results presented here show that BRCA1 and BRCA2 coexist in a biochemical complex and colocalize in subnuclear foci in somatic cells and on the axial elements of developing synaptonemal complexes.	[]
Like BRCA1 and RAD51, BRCA2 relocates to PCNA + replication sites following exposure of S phase cells to hydroxyurea or UV irradiation.	[]
Thus, BRCA1 and BRCA2 participate, together, in a pathway ( s) associated with the activation of double - strand break repair and / or homologous recombination.	[]
Dysfunction of this pathway may be a general phenomenon in the majority of cases of hereditary breast and / or ovarian cancer..

A novel Arg362Ser mutation in the sterol 27 - hydroxylase gene ( CYP27): its effects on pre - mRNA splicing and enzyme activity.	[]
A novel C to A mutation in the sterol 27 - hydroxylase gene ( CYP27) was identified by sequencing amplified CYP27 gene products from a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis ( CTX).

The mutation changed the adrenodoxin cofactor binding residue 362Arg to 362Ser ( CGT 362Arg to AGT 362Ser), and was responsible for deficiency in the sterol 27 - hydroxylase activity, as confirmed by expression of mutant cDNA into COS - 1 cells.	[]
Quantitative analysis showed that the expression of CYP27 gene mRNA in the patient represented 52.	[]
5% of the normal level.	[]
As the mutation occurred at the penultimate nucleotide of exon 6 ( - 2 position of exon 6 - intron 6 splice site) of the gene, we hypothesized that the mutation may partially affect the normal splicing efficiency in exon 6 and cause alternative splicing elsewhere, which resulted in decreased transcript in the patient.	[]
Transfection of constructed minigenes, with or without the mutation, into COS - 1 cells confirmed that the mutant minigene was responsible for a mRNA species alternatively spliced at an activated cryptic 5 splice site 88 bp upstream from the 3 end of exon 6.	[]
Our data suggest that the C to A mutation at the penultimate nucleotide of exon 6 of the CYP27 gene not only causes the deficiency in the sterol 27 - hydroxylase activity, but also partially leads to alternative pre - mRNA splicing of the gene.

To determine whether there could be protective alleles that prevent or reduce the risk of developing BPAD, similar to what is observed in other genetic disorders, we used mental health wellness ( absence of any psychiatric disorder) as the phenotype in our genome - wide linkage scan of several large multigeneration Old Order Amish pedigrees exhibiting an extremely high incidence of BPAD.

The seven exons, the exon / intron boundaries and part of 3 noncoding sequence of the CPO gene were systematically analyzed by an exon - by - exon denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis ( DGGE) strategy followed by direct sequencing in seven unrelated heterozygous HC patients from France, Holland, and Czech Republic.

Seven novel mutations and two new polymorphisms were detected.	[]
Among these mutations two are missense ( G197W, W427R), two are nonsense ( Q306X, Q385X), two are small deletions ( 662de14bp; 1168del3bp removing a glycine at position 390), and one is a splicing mutation ( IVS1 - 15c - - > g) which creates a new acceptor splice site.	[]
The pathological significance of the point mutations G197W, W427R, and the in - frame deletion 390delGly were assessed by their respective expression in a prokaryotic system using site - directed mutagenesis.	[]
These mutations resulted in the absence or a dramatic decrease of CPO activity.	[]
The two polymorphisms were localized in noncoding part of the gene 1) a C / G polymorphism in the promotor region, 142 bp upstream from the transcriptional initiation site ( - 142C / G), and 2) a 6 bp deletion polymorphism in the 3 noncoding part of the CPO gene, 574 bp downstream of the last base of the normal termination codon ( + 574 delATTCTT).

The two other siblings, apparently healthy at 12 ( 1 / 2) and 15 years, respectively, and their father, apparently healthy as well, presented ARSA and GS values within the range of MLD patients.

Mutation screening and sequence analysis disclosed the involvement of three different ARSA mutations being the molecular basis of intrafamilial phenotypic heterogeneity.	[]
The late infantile patient inherited from his mother the frequent 0 - type mutation 459 + 1G > A, and from his father a novel, single basepair microdeletion of guanine at nucleotide 7 in exon 1 ( 7delG).	[]
The two clinically unaffected siblings carried the maternal mutation 459 + 1G > A and, on their paternal allele, a novel cytosine to thymidine transition at nucleotide 2435 in exon 8, resulting in substitution of alanine 464 by valine ( A464V).	[]
The fathers genotype thus was 7delG / A464V.	[]
Mutation A464V was not found in 18 unrelated MLD patients and 50 controls.	"MLD	45	48	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""MLD"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
A464V, although clearly modifying ARSA and GS levels, apparently bears little significance for clinical manifestation of MLD, mimicking the frequent ARSA pseudodeficiency allele.	"MLD	121	124	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""MLD"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Our results demonstrate that in certain genetic conditions MLD - like ARSA and GS values need not be paralleled by clinical disease, a finding with serious diagnostic and prognostic implications.	"MLD	59	62	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""MLD"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Moreover, further ARSA alleles functionally similar to A464V might exist which, together with 0 - type mutations, may cause pathological ARSA and GS levels, but not clinical outbreak of the disease..	[]

It is one member of a family of lamina - associated proteins which includes LAP1, LAP2 and lamin B receptor ( LBR).	[]
A panel of 16 monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs) has been mapped to six specific sites throughout the emerin molecule using phage - displayed peptide libraries and has been used to localize emerin in human and rabbit heart.	[]
Several mAbs against different emerin epitopes did not recognize intercalated discs in the heart, though they recognized cardiomyocyte nuclei strongly, both at the rim and in intranuclear spots or channels.	[]
A polyclonal rabbit antiserum against emerin did recognize both nuclear membrane and intercalated discs but, after affinity purification against a pure - emerin band on a western blot, it stained only the nuclear membrane.	[]
These results would not be expected if immunostaining at intercalated discs were due to a product of the emerin gene and, therefore, cast some doubt upon the hypothesis that cardiac defects in EDMD are caused by absence of emerin from intercalated discs.

BACKGROUND / AIMS The development of colorectal cancer and a variable range of extracolonic manifestations in familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP) is the result of the dominant inheritance of adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC) gene mutations.

In this study, direct mutation analysis of the APC gene was performed to determine genotype - phenotype correlations for nine extracolonic manifestations and to investigate the incidence of APC mutations in non - FAP colorectal cancer.

METHODS The APC gene was analysed in 190 unrelated FAP and 15 non - FAP colorectal cancer patients using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, the protein truncation test, and direct sequencing.

Germ - line and somatic truncating mutations of the APC gene are thought to initiate colorectal tumor formation in familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome and sporadic colorectal carcinogenesis, respectively.

Recently, an isoleucine - - > lysine polymorphism at codon 1307 ( I1307K) of the APC gene has been identified in 6% - 7% of the Ashkenazi Jewish population.	"APC	81	84	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""APC"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
To assess the risk of this common APC allelic variant in colorectal carcinogenesis, we have analyzed a large cohort of unselected Ashkenazi Jewish subjects with adenomatous polyps and. or colorectal cancer, for the APC I1307K polymorphism.	"APC	34	37	Disease/Disorder"	"adenomatous polyps	161	179	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""APC"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""adenomatous polyps"", ""start_span"": 161, ""end_span"": 179, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The APC I1307K allele was identified in 48 ( 10. 1%) of 476 patients.	[]
Compared with the frequency in two separate population control groups, the APC I1307K allele is associated with an estimated relative risk of 1.	[]
5 - 1.	[]
7 for colorectal neoplasia ( both P =. 01).	"colorectal neoplasia	6	26	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""colorectal neoplasia"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Furthermore, compared with noncarriers, APC I1307K carriers had increased numbers of adenomas and colorectal cancers per patient ( P =. 03), as well as a younger age at diagnosis.	"adenomas	85	93	Disease/Disorder"	"colorectal cancers	98	116	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""adenomas"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""colorectal cancers"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
We conclude that the APC I1307K variant leads to increased adenoma formation and directly contributes to 3% - 4% of all Ashkenazi Jewish colorectal cancer.	"adenoma	59	66	Disease/Disorder"	"colorectal cancer	137	154	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""adenoma"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""colorectal cancer"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The estimated relative risk for carriers may justify specific clinical screening for the 360, 000 Americans expected to harbor this allele, and genetic testing in the setting of long - term - outcome studies may impact significantly on colorectal cancer prevention in this population.

Although the link between the BRCA1 tumour - suppressor gene and hereditary breast and ovarian cancer is established, the role, if any, of BRCA1 in non - familial cancers is unclear.

BRCA1 mutations are rare in sporadic cancers, but loss of BRCA1 resulting from reduced expression or incorrect subcellular localization is postulated to be important in non - familial breast and ovarian cancers.	"sporadic cancers	28	44	Disease/Disorder"	"non - familial breast and ovarian cancers	169	210	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""sporadic cancers"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""non - familial breast and ovarian cancers"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 210, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Epigenetic loss, however, has not received general acceptance due to controversy regarding the subcellular localization of BRCA1 proteins, reports of which have ranged from exclusively nuclear, to conditionally nuclear, to the ER / golgi, to cytoplasmic invaginations into the nucleus.	[]
In an attempt to resolve this issue, we have comprehensively characterized 19 anti - BRCA1 antibodies.	[]
These reagents detect a 220 - kD protein localized in discrete nuclear foci in all epithelial cell lines, including those derived from breast malignancies.	"breast malignancies	135	154	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""breast malignancies"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Immunohistochemical staining of human breast specimens also revealed BRCA1 nuclear foci in benign breast, invasive lobular cancers and low - grade ductal carcinomas.

Conversely, BRCA1 expression was reduced or undetectable in the majority of high - grade, ductal carcinomas, suggesting that absence of BRCA1 may contribute to the pathogenesis of a significant percentage of sporadic breast cancers..
