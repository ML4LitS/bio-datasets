Non - human primates, ruminants, wolves ( Canis lupus ), cougars ( Puma concolor) and domestic dogs ( C. l. familiaris) ingest plants with antiparasitic properties but with little or no nutritional value [ 59 – 61, 64 – 66 ], wood ants ( Formica paralugubris) use resin to inhibit the growth of microorganisms [ 67 ], some passerines use lime rind against lice [ 68] and fresh plant material to repel parasites or mask the chemical cues that parasites use to find the host [ 69 ], while great bustards ( Otis tarda) have been shown to consume blister beetles ( Meloidae) that contain secondary metabolites with antimicrobial and pathogen - limiting activity [ 62 ].
