During plant pollen tube ( PT) reception, gametophyte interactions likely allow the species - specific recognition of signals from the PT ( male gametophyte) by the embryo sac ( female gametophyte ), resulting in PT rupture, sperm release, and double fertilization.	"plant	7	12	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""plant"", ""start_span"": 7, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This process is impaired in interspecific crosses between Arabidopsis thaliana and related species, leading to PT overgrowth and a failure to deliver the sperm cells.

Our results suggest that glycosylation patterns of cell surface proteins may represent an important mechanism of gametophyte recognition and thus speciation.	"cell surface proteins	51	72	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cell surface proteins"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In plants, such barriers can either act before ( pre - pollination barriers) or after pollination ( post - pollination barriers ).	"plants	3	9	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""plants"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Pre - pollination barriers can be spatial or temporal patterns preventing plants from being pollinated by pollen from a different species, whereas post - pollination barriers come into play only after an interspecific pollination event occurs and can be further divided into pre - and post - zygotic barriers2.	"plants	74	80	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""plants"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In plants, successful fertilization starts with the deposition of intraspecific ( same - species) pollen ( male gametophyte) onto the stigma of a gynoecium.	"plants	3	9	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""plants"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
However, if a pollen grain originating from a different species ( interspecific pollination) is placed on a plant ' s stigma, all the communication processes described above have the potential to act as pre - zygotic post - pollination barriers.

PT overgrowth restricts gene flow between Arabidopsis species	"Arabidopsis	42	53	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Arabidopsis"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
To analyse interspecific hybridization barriers within the genus Arabidopsis, we assessed PT overgrowth in 86 A. thaliana accessions that were pollinated with A. lyrata pollen ( Supplementary Table 1 ).	"Arabidopsis	65	76	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Arabidopsis"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
PTs were visualized by staining callose in PT cell walls with aniline blue.	"aniline blue	62	74	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""aniline blue"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Thus, PT overgrowth is a hallmark of interspecific crosses with close Brassicaceae relatives and not a species - specific feature of A. thaliana and A. lyrata.

ARTUMES regulates inter - but not intraspecific PT reception	"ARTUMES	0	7	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ARTUMES"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
To date, most GWAS in Arabidopsis have identified previously known candidate genes, with only a few studies identifying novel regulatory genes in the respective pathways2829.	"Arabidopsis	22	33	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Arabidopsis"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In a homozygous T - DNA insertion allele disrupting the coding sequence of At1g61790 ( Fig. 4a ), an average of 84. 3% ( n = 18 siliques) of ovules display A. lyrata PT overgrowth, significantly more than in the Col - 0 wild - type control ( 58. 7% OG / S, n = 28, Student ' s t - test P < 0. 001, Fig. 4b, d, e ).

Likewise, aru - 1 mutants pollinated with A. arenosa pollen showed significantly more ovules with PT overgrowth ( 67. 6% OG / S, n = 8) than the wild type ( 34. 9% OG / S, n = 12, Student ' s t - test P < 0. 001, Supplementary Fig. 6 ), suggesting a common basis for interspecific PT recognition.	"aru - 1	10	17	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aru - 1"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In contrast, aru mutant ovules have no problem recognizing and receiving intraspecific PTs from A. thaliana ( Fig. 4c, g ), indicating that the PT reception pathway is fully functional within the species.	"aru	13	16	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aru"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Since ARU is not fused to a fluorescent tag here, technical difficulties in measuring synergid specific expression of the transgene make it hard to explore this difference experimentally.

SNPs around ARTUMES correlate with phenotypic variation	"ARTUMES	12	19	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ARTUMES"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Within this population, we detected a total of 10 amino acid differences, four of which are significantly correlated to variation in OG / S ( Pearson ' s correlation coefficient R, P < 0. 05, Supplementary Data 1 ).	"amino acid	50	60	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""amino acid"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Therefore, we examined alignments of 1, 000 bp up - and downstream sequence of ARU.	"ARU	79	82	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ARU"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
We found ARU mRNA levels differed between accessions ( Supplementary Fig. 8 ), but they did not correlate with the OG / S phenotype among the selected set of accessions.	"ARU	9	12	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ARU"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Because we used RNA from whole pistils and ovules, we cannot exclude the possibility that ARU is differentially expressed in synergids only, where it is required and sufficient for interspecific PT reception.	"ARU	90	93	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ARU"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Of several independent transformants of all accessions, none showed a significant reduction of OG / S ( Supplementary Fig. 8 ), which would be expected if low expression of ARU alone would be the cause of impaired interspecific PT reception in these accessions.	"ARU	173	176	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ARU"", ""start_span"": 173, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Because ARU is likely only one of several factors involved in interspecific PT reception, we cannot rule out that crucial epistatic interactions with other factors were missing in the particular accessions we tested.	"ARU	8	11	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ARU"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Signatures of selection at the ARTUMES locus	"ARTUMES	31	38	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ARTUMES"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
We tested ARU plus 1, 000 bp up - and downstream sequence for signatures of positive selection by estimating Tajima ' s D39 for a set of 96 A. thaliana accessions40, including all accessions used in this study.	"ARU	10	13	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ARU"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Tajima ' s D was − 2. 07 for the 1, 000 bp upstream of the translation start, − 1. 57 for the coding sequence and − 1. 58 for the 1, 000 bp downstream of the ARU stop - codon.	"ARU	158	161	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ARU"", ""start_span"": 158, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Thus, although the 1, 000 bp upstream region was very close to this cut - off, the observed negative values might be influenced by demographic factors that shaped the entire genome rather than selective pressure acting on the ARU locus.	"ARU	226	229	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ARU"", ""start_span"": 226, ""end_span"": 229, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Such strongly negative values for H indicate that positive selection may indeed have acted on each of the regions of the ARU locus.	"ARU	121	124	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ARU"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The fact that D for the upstream region was very close to the 5% tail and the strongly negative values for H provide evidence for possible positive selection and indicate that ARU may have undergone a recent selective sweep.	"ARU	176	179	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ARU"", ""start_span"": 176, ""end_span"": 179, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Nevertheless, as in animal speciation genes, selective pressures appear to have contributed to shaping the genetic basis that underlies interspecific PT reception in A. thaliana.	"animal	20	26	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""animal"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In line with this, aru has previously been identified in an EMS - screen for cell wall mutants34.	"aru	19	22	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aru"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
These results indicate that, in the absence of functional ARU, these proteins are properly targeted to their subcellular compartment.	"ARU	58	61	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ARU"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Ligands from interspecific PTs might not be able to sufficiently interact via protein – protein contacts alone but could still be recognized to some extent via the carbohydrate moieties, explaining the partial A. lyrata PT reception success in Col - 0 ovules ( Fig. 6b ).	"carbohydrate	164	176	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""carbohydrate"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
It is conceivable that in aru, and potentially also in A. thaliana accessions with a similar phenotype, changes in the glycosylation status of the receptor could completely abolish the ability to recognize and receive interspecific PTs ( Fig. 6d ), while ligands from A. thaliana PTs are still efficiently recognized via protein – protein interactions, leading to normal PT reception ( Fig. 6c ).	"aru	26	29	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aru"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Our results suggest that both protein – protein interactions and recognition mediated by carbohydrates may be crucial factors to ensure species - specific PT reception.

Next, sociability was tested in social interaction test with a juvenile WT male mouse as a social partner.	"mouse	80	85	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Mice of each genotype were put into the box with a Y shape and the percentage of correct entry numbers per total entry numbers ( alteration rates) was evaluated.	"Mice	0	4	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Mice"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
WT mice exhibited alteration rates of approximately 60 %.	"mice	3	7	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The total number of entries differed between genotypes, reflecting the hyperactivity of the mutant mice observed at baseline ( P = 0. 0015; Figure 5d ).	"mice	99	103	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

The expression level of PSD95 in hippocampus was not changed.	"PSD95	24	29	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PSD95"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
This is presumably because the change in the PSD95 expression in the hippocampal spines was region - specific or the minute change could not be detected by using the western blot test.	"PSD95	45	50	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PSD95"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
However, we should be careful in the interpretation of this data, as this tendency may just reflect the heightened baseline hyperactivity of these mice.	"mice	147	151	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Therefore, the transcription of target genes is suppressed when JMJD2B is depleted.	"JMJD2B	64	70	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""JMJD2B"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

One of these potential factors is that many RCTs selected patients who suffered from discrete traumas such as physical or sexual assault or traffic accidents ( but may have also experienced additional other traumas, e. g ., Bryant, Moulds, Guthrie, Dang, & Nixon, 2003; Ehlers et al ., 2003; Foa et al ., 2005; Resick, Nishith, Weaver, Astin, & Feuer, 2002; Schnurr et al, 2007 ), whereas in clinical practice patients may require treatment for wider range of traumas including prolonged and multiple traumatic events.

Although limited conclusions can be drawn from comparing dropout rates in different samples across countries with different health systems, it appears safe to conclude that the low dropout rates support the acceptability of CT - PTSD to patients.

The intent - to - treat effect sizes were somewhat smaller than those observed in some previous RCTs of CT - PTSD ( Ehlers et al ., 2003, 2005 ), but similar to or larger than those observed in intent - to - treat analyses in other RCTs of trauma - focused cognitive behavior therapy ( Bryant et al ., 2003; Resick et al ., 2002; Schnurr et al, 2007 ).

Like other studies of TF - CBT programs ( e. g ., Richardson et al ., 2011; van Minnen et al ., 2002 ), this study found few other moderators of treatment response, further indicating that CT - PTSD is effective in a wide range of patients.

With the exception of mood disorders, current comorbidity did not moderate outcome, but acted as a nonspecific predictor of outcome only.	"mood disorders	22	36	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""mood disorders"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

One possible explanation for the discrepant results may be the range of depression severity included in the studies.	"depression	72	82	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""depression"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Comorbid depression may only hamper progress in therapy if it is so severe that it affects daily activity levels and motivation to engage in the therapy assignments.	"depression	9	19	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""depression"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Longer time since the trauma, a history of suicide attempts or substance dependence, social problems, and relationship status ( never having been married or lived with a partner) were associated with a somewhat less favorable treatment response.	"substance dependence	63	83	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""substance dependence"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
These characteristics, and possibly very high levels of depression, may characterize a group of patients with high levels of demoralization and hopelessness, who may not have been fully engaged in treatment by their therapists.	"depression	56	66	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""depression"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The differences in results may also be linked to the wide range of traumas included in the latter samples ( for example, the inclusion of traumatic death of significant others ), or the long - term effects of the trauma and / or PTSD symptoms on important life areas such as employment, significant relationships or other resources ( Hobfoll, 2002 ).	"PTSD	229	233	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""PTSD"", ""start_span"": 229, ""end_span"": 233, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Social problems and social isolation may make it harder to overcome PTSD and may also create additional ongoing stress ( see also Galovski et al ., 2012 ).	"PTSD	68	72	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""PTSD"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The result that patients who had never lived with a partner had somewhat worse outcome may also point to a role of poor social support and interpersonal skills in the recovery from PTSD ( see also Cloitre, Koenen, Cohen, & Han, 2002 ).

Indeed, it has been suggested that policies aimed at reducing tobacco consumption may be responsible for widening the socioeconomic differentials in smoking, at least in the short - term.

We then look at the crystallographic image of the 1K74 ligand - PPARγ complex ( PDB code: 1K47) [ 36 ].	"PPARγ	64	69	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PPAR\u03b3"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Moreover, the potency orders and tendencies ( signs of regression coefficients) of structural modifications coincide with our knowledge about the structural modifications of PPARγ agonists.

So the top - ranked structural modifications can detect their corresponding key interactions surrounding molecular binding, as shown in the X - ray image of a potent agonist - PPARγ complex.

It therefore contradicts the observation that the captured symbols, aaO, aaaC, sssN, aaNH, and aaN, represent positive structural modifications to the tail part of PPARγ agonists.

Obviously, in this equation form 3, the symbols aaO and sssN represent the identical key interaction in the tail part of PPARγ agonists, and the simultaneous appearance of them for the same moiety turned the regression coefficient of the additional aaN into the opposite sign.

A comparative cross - sectional study among 790 randomly selected new cases of TB ( 395 each treated with 4RH and 6EH during the continuation phase) was conducted in nine health centers and one hospital in three zones in southwestern Ethiopia.	"TB	79	81	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""TB"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Data were abstracted from the standard unit TB register composed of standard case and treatment outcome definitions.	"TB	44	46	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""TB"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The switch of continuation phase TB treatment regimen from 6EH to 4RH has brought better treatment outcomes which imply applicability of the recommendation in high prevalent and resource constrained settings.	"TB	33	35	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""TB"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Therefore, it should be maintained and augmented through further studies on its impact among the older, rural residents and HIV positives.	"HIV	124	127	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Introduction of chemotherapy resulted in cure and reduction of mortality for majority of TB cases [ 1, 3 ].	"TB	89	91	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""TB"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Subsequent to the introduction of rifampicin ( R ), effective short - course chemotherapy regimens for less than 12 months became standard therapy [ 2, 5 – 7 ].	"rifampicin	34	44	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""rifampicin"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
As a result, regimens without rifampicin had been considered safer in developing countries owing to irregular treatments and high absentee rates [ 1, 5 ].	"rifampicin	30	40	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""rifampicin"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
However, the latest World Health Organization ( WHO) guideline recommends 2 - month initial phase of ( 2RHZE) and a 4 - month continuation phase ( 4RH) for the treatment of virtually all forms of new TB cases across the globe [ 7 ].	"TB	200	202	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""TB"", ""start_span"": 200, ""end_span"": 202, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Thus, we compared treatment outcomes of TB cases who received 4RH and 6EH continuation phase regimens under routine program condition in high burden and resource limited setting.	"TB	40	42	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""TB"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Our objective was to compare baseline patients ’ bacteriologic, socio - demographics, clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes among those TB patients treated with the 4RH and 6EH continuation phase treatment regimens.

Ethiopia is among the 22 TB High Burden Countries ( HBC) where 230, 000 incident cases of which 147, 592 ( 64 %) were notified.	"TB	25	27	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""TB"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The country has adopted and implemented the DOTS strategy for the treatment of all forms of TB.	"TB	92	94	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""TB"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Accordingly new cases of TB had been treated with directly observed RHZE combinations for the first 2 months ( 2RHZE) followed by self administered EH combinations for six months ( 6EH) [ 19 ].	"TB	25	27	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""TB"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Thus the regimen became directly observed 2RHZE / 4RH combinations for all forms of new TB cases throughout the 6 months treatment period [ 11 ].	"TB	88	90	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""TB"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The zones ( an administrative unit that liaison weredas with the region) are organized in to four town administrations and 26 weredas ( lowest administrative unit closer to the community) those have three hospitals and 65 health centers those provide TB DOTS services for free.

Lastly, cases from the selected health facilities were selected randomly using SPSS statistical software using TB unit number of the cases.	"TB	111	113	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""TB"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Data were extracted from a standard unit TB register recommended by the WHO [ 11, 19, 22] using extraction format prepared for the study.	"TB	41	43	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""TB"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
With regard to the patient profile, 86. 8% and 77% were registered at health center and had pulmonary TB, respectively.	"pulmonary TB	92	104	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""pulmonary TB"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
A total of, 324 ( 90. 3 %), 208 ( 85. 4 %) and 163 ( 91. 1 %) of pulmonary positive, pulmonary negative and extra pulmonary TB cases respectively had successful outcomes with statistically significant difference, P = 0. 03.	"pulmonary TB	114	126	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""pulmonary TB"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
On the other hand, of those initially smear positive pulmonary TB cases, 78. 6% had undergone sputum follow up examination at least once after the diagnosis ( 76. 3% among 6HE and 80. 9% among 4HR, p = 0. 3 ).	"pulmonary TB	53	65	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""pulmonary TB"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
But, in multivariate analysis 4RH continuation phase treatment regimen [ AOR ( 95% CI) 0. 55 ( 0. 34, 0. 89 )], patient age [ AOR ( 95% CI) 1. 02 ( 1. 001, 1. 022 )], rural residence [ AOR ( 95% CI) 2. 1 ( 1. 18, 3. 75 )], treated at health center [ AOR ( 95% CI) 0. 37 ( 0. 14, 0. 97 )], HIV positives [ AOR ( 95% CI 2. 38 ( 1. 12, 5. 07 )], gained weight at the end of the second month [ AOR ( 95% CI) 0. 28 ( 0. 11, 0. 72 )] independently predicted unsuccessful treatment outcome ( Table 3 ).	"HIV	289	292	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 289, ""end_span"": 292, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The odds of unsuccessful outcome was higher among the older, rural residents, HIV positives and unknown weight change at the end of second month treatment.	"HIV	78	81	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Treatment outcomes among TB patients treated with RHZE for the first 2 months, followed by HE for 6 months ( 2RHZE / 6EH) and RH for 4 months ( 2RHZE / 4RH) was compared.	"TB	25	27	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""TB"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Patients residing in rural areas had higher risk of unsuccessful outcomes which could be attributed to the low access to TB care and unfavorable living conditions.	"TB	121	123	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""TB"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Monitoring of patient weight and sputum are among the recommended follow - up measures required for TB patients on treatment [ 7 ].	"TB	100	102	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""TB"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The proportion of smear positive patients converted to negative at the end of the intensive phase has been taken among indicators of TB programme performance [ 7 ].	"TB	133	135	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""TB"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
This could be explained by the fact that weight gain marks some level of improvement from the TB illness including reduced appetite.	"TB	94	96	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""TB"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Nonetheless, we found no statistically significant difference in treatment success among those infected TB patients provided with CPT and / or ART.	"TB	104	106	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""TB"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
However, only few HIV co infected patients ( 45% on CPT and 27. 3% on ART) were found to have documented service provision.	"HIV	18	21	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
On the other hand, unknown HIV status predicted higher odds of unsuccessful outcomes.	"HIV	27	30	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This could be due to possible misclassification of HIV positive cases those predict worse outcome in to unknown.	"HIV	51	54	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In conclusion, the switch of continuation phase TB treatment regimen for new cases from 6EH to 4RH has brought better treatment outcomes.	"TB	48	50	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""TB"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
However, the unsuccessful outcome among the older, rural dwellers and HIV positives is higher independent of the treatment regimen that need further investigation and focused intervention.	"HIV	70	73	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Moreover, further studies should be carried out on the impact of treatment regimens among older, rural residents and HIV positives.	"HIV	117	120	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

We report here the effects of the prebiotic polysaccharide inulin and its hydrolysed form FOS on this bacterium.	"bacterium	102	111	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bacterium"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
FOS was found to inhibit bacterial growth of strain PAO1, while inulin did not affect growth rate or yield in a significant manner.	"PAO1	52	56	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""PAO1"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Western blot experiments indicated that the effects mediated by FOS in macrophages are associated with a decreased activation of the NF - κB pathway.	"NF - κB	133	140	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NF - \u03baB"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Since FOS and inulin stimulate pathway activation in the absence of bacteria, the FOS mediated effect is likely to be of indirect nature, such as via a reduction of bacterial virulence.	"bacteria	68	76	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bacteria"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Further, this modulatory effect is observed also with the highly virulent ptxS mutated strain.	"ptxS	74	78	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ptxS"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Co - culture experiments of P. aeruginosa with IEC18 eukaryotic cells showed that FOS reduces the concentration of the major virulence factor, exotoxin A, suggesting that this is a possible mechanism for the reduction of pathogenicity.	"exotoxin A	143	153	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""exotoxin A"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The bacterium is highly resistant to antibiotic treatment and difficult to eradicate once established in the host [ 9 ].	"bacterium	4	13	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bacterium"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Bacteria use different secretion systems to inject virulence factors into the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells, leading to bacterial replication within macrophages and, consequently, evasion from the immune system [ 16 ].	"Bacteria	0	8	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Bacteria"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In Gram - negative bacteria several secretion systems have been characterized, referred to as type I to type VI systems [ 17 ], [ 18 ].	"Gram - negative bacteria	3	27	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Gram - negative bacteria"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In contrast, the type III secretion system ( T3SS) injects proteins, small molecular weight compounds and hydrolytic enzymes into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells [ 23 ], which corresponds to a potent virulence mechanism shared by many pathogenic Gram - negative bacteria.	"Gram - negative bacteria	246	270	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Gram - negative bacteria"", ""start_span"": 246, ""end_span"": 270, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This protein injection in turn triggers a cytoskeletal reorganization of the host cell as shown by the inhibition of P. aeruginosa internalization upon incubation with cytochalasin D [ 24 ], which destroys microfilaments, thereby preventing further uptake of bacteria [ 16 ], [ 23 ], [ 25 ].	"bacteria	259	267	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bacteria"", ""start_span"": 259, ""end_span"": 267, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In addition inulin and FOS have been found to have a beneficial impact on human health, including the stimulation of calcium, iron and zinc absorption [ 35] and the modulation of local and systemic immune responses [ 36 ].	"human	74	79	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Attenuated responses are observed also with the virulent ptxS mutant strain.	"ptxS	57	61	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ptxS"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Exotoxin A production is lowered by FOS treatment, suggesting that FOS may interfere with exotoxin synthesis and / or secretion.	"Exotoxin A	0	10	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Exotoxin A"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
To assess the effect of inulin and FOS on P. aeruginosa, growth curves were recorded in minimal medium M9 supplemented with citrate.	"citrate	124	131	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""citrate"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
As a control, growth in the minimal medium M9 supplemented with 20 mg / ml of goat milk oligosaccharides ( OS) is shown.	"goat	78	82	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""goat"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Since inulin and FOS differ only in the carbohydrate chain length, this parameter appears to be central for antibacterial activity.	"carbohydrate	40	52	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""carbohydrate"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In comparison, a growth curve was recorded in the presence of 20 mg / ml of control goat milk oligosaccharides ( OS ), showing promotion of bacterial growth at the same concentration at which FOS inhibits growth.

Twitching motility across solid surfaces [ 39] has been found to be required for biofilm development [ 13 ], [ 40 ], as well as for a persistent colonization of lungs, and it is associated with virulence in corneal infection models [ 39 ], [ 41 ].

Initial experiments were carried out to establish the experimental conditions for the assessment of the effect of FOS and inulin on cytokine secretion ( Fig.	"cytokine	132	140	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cytokine"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

These data therefore show that the presence of inulin and particularly FOS reduced the inflammatory response of macrophages to bacterial infection.	"bacterial infection	127	146	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""bacterial infection"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Values are means ± s. e. m ., n = 6 – 8; * P < 0. 05 vs macrophage without bacteria and & P < 0. 05 vs WT in the absence of inulin or FOS ( ANOVA followed by least significance tests ).

As shown in Fig. 5A, neither FOS nor inulin affected the phosphospecific signal of the three MAPK, suggesting that they are not involved in the observed changes.	"MAPK	93	97	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MAPK"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In contrast, FOS but not inulin reduced IκB - α phosphorylation, pointing to a modulation of the NFκ - B canonical pathway.	"IκB - α	40	47	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""I\u03baB - \u03b1"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

Therefore, the effect of FOS is associated with a minor activation of the NF - κB signalling pathway.	"NF - κB	74	81	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NF - \u03baB"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Since the FOS - mediated inhibition of bacterial growth and biofilm formation may reduce virulence, we hypothesized that the response of eukaryotic cells to infection may be modulated by the presence of this oligosaccharide.

Our results show that predictive ability depends on the extent and nature of the genetic correlation between the training and the validation populations. Heslot et al.

Levels of WSCC increase and decrease with crop development and growing conditions, meaning that full expression of the phenotype is not easily captured, and both wet chemistry and NIRS methods for measuring water soluble carbohydrates are time consuming and expensive ( Gebbing and Schnyder 1999; Ruuska et al. 2006 ).

We estimated that most of the genotypic variance for WSCC did not fit a polygenic additive polygenic model, a surprising result considering numerous results showing that wheat grain yield is often adequately described with an additive genetic model ( Heslot et al. 2012; Pérez - Rodríguez et al. 2012; Burgueño et al. 2012 ).

The RABV measures can be coupled with the assumptions of Desta and Ortiz ( 2014 ); Heffner et al. ( 2010 ); and Lorenz et al. ( 2011) suggesting genomic selection is predicted to facilitate a reduction in the breeding cycle time of the average wheat breeding program of at least half due to the ability to select at earlier generations and also in off - season generations.

Briefly, this transition consists of E. coli cells growing exponentially on a glucose minimal medium and excreting acetate into the medium as a metabolic overflow product.	"glucose	78	85	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
When the cells run out of glucose, the CCM is reorganized, thereby enabling the cell to consume the acetate.	"glucose	26	33	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

No significant differences were observed between the WT and the ΔcsrBC and ΔcsrD mutant strains during the growth phase on glucose ( Fig. 1A ).	"glucose	123	130	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
This was corroborated by the similar glucose consumption profiles of the strains ( Fig. 1B ).	"glucose	37	44	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The other three strains also consumed the acetate produced after glucose exhaustion but with different timings, resulting in the ΔcsrD mutant strain consuming its acetate first, followed by the WT and then the ΔcsrBC mutant strain ( Fig. 1C ).

To illustrate, at 1 h after glucose exhaustion, these rates were, respectively, − 1. 50 ± 0. 26, − 0. 82 ± 0. 32, and − 0. 58 ± 0. 12 mM ⋅ g of dry weight ( gDW )− 1 ⋅ h − 1 in the ΔcsrD mutant, WT, and ΔcsrBC mutant strains.

To conclude, the investigated strains showed a range of phenotypes according to their CsrA activity.	"CsrA	86	90	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CsrA"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The csrA51 mutant was the most affected strain, with high glycogen and low acetate contents and a reduced growth rate.	"csrA51	4	10	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""csrA51"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
We assumed that the differences in acetate consumption between the strains could result from differential gene expression in the CCM after glucose exhaustion.	"glucose	139	146	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
This was assessed by performing quantitative reverse transcription ( RT )- PCR analysis of 14 key CCM genes ( 34) during the metabolic transition from 3 h preceding to 2 h after glucose exhaustion ( Fig. 2 ).

In contrast, the differences between the strains were globally reduced after glucose exhaustion, except for the genes involved in acetate and glycogen metabolism ( Fig. 2 ).

As expected ( 16 ), the csrA51 mutant strain displayed larger metabolite pools in the upper part of the glycolysis process ( glucose - 6 - phosphate [ G6P ], fructose - 6 - phosphate [ F6P ]) than the WT.	"csrA51	24	30	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""csrA51"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
( A) Metabolite concentrations were investigated from 3 h before to 2 h after glucose exhaustion.	"glucose	78	85	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
These results suggested that the energy level after glucose exhaustion differs between strains.	"glucose	52	59	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
At 90 min after glucose exhaustion, the AEC had decreased in all of the strains.	"glucose	16	23	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
However, in the csrA51 mutant strain, the AEC remained significantly higher than in the WT, and the ΔcsrBC mutant AEC collapsed to 0. 50, a value previously linked to dying cells ( 35 ).	"csrA51	16	22	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""csrA51"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
We thus hypothesize that the energy levels in the Csr system mutant strains could be linked to the observed differences in the kinetics of acetate consumption.	"Csr	50	53	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Csr"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Both glycogen and acetate influence the energy status after glucose exhaustion.	"glucose	60	67	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We analyzed the relationship between energy fluxes and acetate consumption rates by investigating the distribution of the energy fluxes after glucose exhaustion in the different strains.	"glucose	142	149	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
During the acetate consumption phase, glycogen is also consumed as an intracellular storage sugar and is thus also likely to be involved in the balance between energy fluxes.	"sugar	92	97	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sugar"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
These parameters were analyzed in the ranges of acetate and glycogen consumption rates we monitored after glucose exhaustion ( Fig. 1; see Materials and Methods for details of the procedure ).	"glucose	106	113	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Although the ΔcsrD mutant strain displayed the greatest ATP flux from a mixture of glycogen and acetate 90 min after glucose exhaustion ( Fig. 4A ), growth was only barely detectable and stopped 1 h later when both acetate and glycogen were depleted ( Fig. 1 and 4 ).	"glucose	117	124	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We thus conclude that both acetate and glycogen can be used to maintain the energy status of the cells after glucose exhaustion but that their consumption rates are too low to ensure observable growth.	"glucose	109	116	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Even in the csrA51 mutant strain, which has the highest energy level AEC and glycogen content ( up to 30% of the biomass ), the ATP produced is only sufficient to ensure maintenance, i. e ., to allow the strain to survive but not to grow efficiently.

As shown above, both acetate and glycogen can be used to maintain the energy status after glucose exhaustion but the corresponding ATP fluxes did not enable us to distinguish differences in the energy level AEC and fitness related to acetate consumption in the different strains.	"glucose	90	97	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Only glycogen levels appeared to accompany the high energy level of the csrA51 mutant strain and the low energy level of the ΔcsrBC mutant ( Fig. 1D and 3B ).	"csrA51	72	78	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""csrA51"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Some of the WT and csrA51 mutant metabolite pools, e. g ., FBP, differed quantitatively from those shown in Fig. 3A, very likely because these cultures were performed in Erlenmeyer flasks instead of in reactors with regulated pH and monitored oxygenation.

The long delays in the csrA51 mutant strain could be explained by the difficulty in setting up acetate consumption in the presence of highly abundant glycogen, which could be a more favorable substrate.

The Csr system was recently demonstrated to be a major controller of upper glycolysis fluxes ( 16 ), but its involvement in metabolic adaptation is less clear in the literature.	"Csr	4	7	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Csr"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
CsrA is known to positively regulate glycolytic genes and negatively regulate gluconeogenic genes ( 15, 16 ).	"CsrA	0	4	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CsrA"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
It will be awkward to totally rule out any control of these genes by CsrA, since regulation could be at the posttranscriptional level.	"CsrA	69	73	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CsrA"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
We proved that glycogen allows the maintenance of a minimal cellular energy level after glucose exhaustion.	"glucose	88	95	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Conversely, a ΔcsrBC mutant strain that accumulates a very low level of glycogen presents phenotypes similar to those of a ΔglgC mutant strain after glucose exhaustion, with a low energy status and a weaker adaptive capacity to use acetate.	"glucose	149	156	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 149, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
From our work, it is now clear that CsrA regulates the metabolic transition from glycolysis to gluconeogenesis in E. coli.	"CsrA	36	40	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CsrA"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Most of the elements presented here strengthen the hypothesis that the transition control by the Csr system is exerted through the regulation of glycogen synthesis and its utilization.	"Csr	97	100	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Csr"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The only clue we observed concerning a glycogen - independent effect of CsrA during the transition is in the production of cAMP, an alarmone that has an important function in the catabolite repression process ( 38 ).	"CsrA	72	76	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CsrA"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
This could result from the greater availability of G6P, since this substrate indirectly controls adenylate cyclase activity ( 39 ).	"adenylate cyclase	97	114	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""adenylate cyclase"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
CsrA could thus affect important metabolic adaption processes, such as catabolite repression, independently of glycogen content.	"CsrA	0	4	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CsrA"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
This reinforces the very recently discovered link between Csr and catabolite repression regulatory systems ( 29 ).	"Csr	58	61	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Csr"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
There could be another clue to glycogen - independent control; i. e ., if glycogen exhaustion hinders metabolic adaptation, glycogen overaccumulation ( as in the csrA51 mutant strain) should favor it.	"csrA51	162	168	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""csrA51"", ""start_span"": 162, ""end_span"": 168, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
However, the delay before the beginning of acetate anabolism was longer in the csrA51 mutant strain.	"csrA51	79	85	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""csrA51"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
We consequently conclude that CsrA control of metabolic adaptation is mediated mainly through glycogen accumulation.	"CsrA	30	34	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CsrA"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

Nicotine is a high - risk factor for many diseases and has negative effects on soft and bony tissue healing [ 11, 12 ], which can also influence the repair of cartilage defects and suppress the chondrogenic differentiation of BMSCs [ 13, 17 ].

The concentration of NE in the hypothalamus is significantly decreased, which suggests that the dysfunction of central NE is related to depression [ 31 ].	"depression	136	146	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""depression"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Dopamine ( DA) is involved in the regulation of motivation, volition, interest / pleasure, and attention / concentration, all of which are likely to be impaired in depressed patients.	"Dopamine	0	8	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Dopamine"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Several previous reports have suggested that depression may often be accompanied by a relative hypodopaminergic state [ 33 ].	"depression	45	55	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""depression"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Thus, it is well known that many antidepressant drugs currently in use exert effects by regulating the reuptake and metabolic balance of monoamine neurotransmitters [ 34 ].

As an important inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, GABA decreases significantly in the patients of depression [ 36 ].	"depression	106	116	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""depression"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Tryptophan is the precursor of 5 - HT and its reduction could lead to synthesis of 5 - HT and so lead to 5 - HT content decrease in the brain, thus causing depressive symptoms [ 40 ].	"Tryptophan	0	10	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Tryptophan"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In a stress state, HPA axis function becomes hyperactive and 5 - HT synthesis significantly decreases as a result of insufficient tryptophan transported into the CNS [ 41 ].	"tryptophan	130	140	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""tryptophan"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The increased 5 - HTT will increase the reuptake of 5 - HT in synaptic cleft, which aggravates the decrease of 5 - HT concentration and the severity of the symptoms in depressed patients [ 42 ].	"5 - HTT	14	21	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""5 - HTT"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In addition, some of the studies indicate that 5 - HT, DA, and NE can stimulate the hypothalamus to secret CRH, which suggest that a positive feedback neural circuit exists between hypothalamic neurons and neurons secreting 5 - HT, DA, and NE [ 45 ].	"CRH	107	110	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CRH"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

There is a close relationship between HAP and neurotransmitters in regulating emotion and behavior in depression [ 51 ].	"depression	102	112	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""depression"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Wrist - forearm pain, significantly mediated ( 95% CI: − 0. 1050, − 0. 0036) about 29. 7% of the relationship between obesity and moderate physical function ( Table 3 ).

This suggests that the adverse effects of obesity on moderate physical function may be manifested in part, through wrist - forearm pain.	"obesity	42	49	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""obesity"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
A study by Heo et al. found that attenuation in the association between obesity and functional impairment was largely explained by medical comorbid conditions, and indicated the presence of joint pain and mental health problems further reduced the odds ratios in this relationship [ 10 ].

Lastly, the pain in the wrist - forearm region also significantly mediated the relationship between obesity and ESE ( 95% CI: − 0. 1510, − 0. 0137 ), at about 17. 6% ( Table 6 ).	"obesity	100	107	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""obesity"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

The reverse associations may occur in that musculoskeletal pain may affect obesity, as also supported by previous reviews [ 3, 8, 9, 24 ].	"obesity	75	82	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""obesity"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The results from the empirical test of the OMH and OEP model suggest that experiencing pain may be a mechanism by which obesity affects impaired HRQOL, lower PA levels, and lower ESE.

Analysis of aligned genomes supports the division of wisent into two previously recognized subspecies, but almost half of the genomic alignment contradicts this population history as a result of incomplete lineage sorting and admixture.	"wisent	53	59	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In historical times, wisent ranged extensively across semi - open habitats and broadleaved, mixed and coniferous forests in Western Europe, from what is today France in the west to the Volga River and the Caucasus in the east, with the northernmost range limits around 60 ° north ( fig. 1; Kuemmerle et al.	"wisent	21	27	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
However, the actual founding captive population of wisent was considerably smaller, and is thought to comprise of just 12 individuals ( Slatis 1960 ).	"wisent	51	57	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
All but one of these 12 founders were Lowland wisent, almost half of which came from a population established in 1865 in Pless ( now Pszczyna, Poland ).	"Lowland wisent	38	52	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Lowland wisent"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The Lowland line ( L) derives from seven Lowland founders ( 4 males and 3 females ), and is thus considered to represent a pure Lowland wisent lineage.

The Lowland - Caucasian ( LC) line originates from all 12 founders ( 5 males, 7 females ), which included the last remaining Caucasian wisent bull ( Slatis 1960 ).

Descendants of the LC line thus represent a mixture of Lowland and Caucasian wisent ancestry.	"Caucasian wisent	67	83	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Caucasian wisent"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Although the wisent restitution undoubtedly represents a tremendous conservation success, several factors may limit the long - term viability of the species, many of which are applicable to ex - situ conservation strategies in general.

A factor that has received particular attention is that of reduced genetic variability, which may be correlated with a lowered resistance to disease and parasites in wisent ( Karbowiak et al.

Although genetic variability among living wisent herds has been widely investigated using a variety of genetic markers ( Gralak et al.	"wisent	42	48	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

However, levels of genetic variability occurring prior to extinction of wisent in the wild, and any potential loss of genetic variability following the establishment of the captive breeding population, remains unquantified.

The resulting probability densities showed that nuclear genomic divergence is broadly similar among all modern and founding wisent ( fig. 2A ).	"wisent	124	130	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The two founding individuals, PLANTA and PLATEN, are somewhat less diverged from one another than either is from all modern wisent ( fig. 2A ), reflecting their mother - son relationship.

Genomic divergence between Caucasian and both modern and founding wisent greatly exceeds that occurring between the latter two groups ( fig. 2A – C ).	"wisent	66	72	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Substantial divergence is also found between the two Caucasian wisent individuals.	"Caucasian wisent	53	69	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Caucasian wisent"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We also investigated mitochondrial genome variability among all individuals subjected to nuclear genome sequencing, in addition to seven other modern wisent ( supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online ).

These results hint at a major loss of mitochondrial haplotype diversity prior to the extinction of wisent in the wild.	"wisent	99	105	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This inference is supported by additional haplotypes that we recovered from three ancient late Holocene Lowland wisent from Austria ( the range of calibrated age is from ca.

All these ancient haplotypes are substantially divergent from those found in modern and historical wisent, suggesting a substantial loss of haplotype diversity, potentially within the last ∼ 1, 300 years.

Neighbor - joining phylogenetic analysis of total nuclear genomic divergence supports paraphyly of Caucasian wisent ( fig. 2D ), as does analysis of mitochondrial haplotypes ( supplementary fig.

We further investigated the population history of wisent by dividing aligned nuclear genome sequences into non - overlapping 1 Mb blocks and subjecting each block to maximum - likelihood phylogenetic analysis.	"wisent	50	56	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We found that 57% of the investigated genomic blocks support reciprocal monophyly of Caucasian and Lowland wisent ( fig. 3 ).	"Lowland wisent	99	113	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Lowland wisent"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Nevertheless, almost half of the genome sequence alignment of these individuals contradicts the true population history.

We investigated patterns of admixture among wisent using the D statistic test for admixture ( Green et al.	"wisent	44	50	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We first investigated patterns of derived allele sharing among modern wisent, and found no statistically significant signal of admixture between the modern LC line individual and either modern L line individual ( supplementary table S5, Supplementary Material online ).	"wisent	70	76	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We then investigated admixture involving Caucasian wisent.	"Caucasian wisent	41	57	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Caucasian wisent"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This indicates that a proportion of the genome of PLANTA can be attributed to admixture with Caucasian wisent.	"Caucasian wisent	93	109	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Caucasian wisent"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Furthermore, we can deduce that PLEBEJER, the father of PLATEN, must have possessed a lower level of Caucasian wisent admixture than PLANTA, and that PLATEN himself was likely admixed to some degree through inheritance from PLANTA.	"Caucasian wisent	101	117	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Caucasian wisent"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Consistent with expectations, we found that the modern LC line individual ( MdLC) shares an excess of derived alleles with one of the Caucasian wisent ( Cc1) relative to modern L line individuals ( fig. 5C ).	"Caucasian wisent	134	150	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Caucasian wisent"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We did not, however, detect such an excess between the modern LC line individual and the second Caucasian wisent ( Cc2 ), relative to the modern L line individuals.

Around 8% of these blocks are likely to result from incomplete lineage sorting, based on the frequency of occurrence of the opposing topology ( fig. 6 ), producing an overall estimate of 14% of the genome of the modern LC individual that results from Caucasian wisent admixture, most likely inherited from the bull KAUKASUS.

We compared the sizes of these blocks with those of putative Caucasian wisent ancestry in a modern L line individual, and found the abundance of large blocks to be considerably lower in the latter ( fig. 7 ).	"Caucasian wisent	61	77	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Caucasian wisent"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

However, analysis of aligned nuclear genomic blocks from four individuals returns Caucasian and Lowland wisent as reciprocally monophyletic across slightly more than half of the genomic alignment ( fig. 3 ), providing support that this topology reflects the true history of population divergence.	"Lowland wisent	96	110	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Lowland wisent"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
On this basis, the modern L line that is derived only from the latter can also be considered as pure Lowland wisent, referable to the subspecies B. b. bonasus.

The issue of low genetic variability among living wisent is considered as cause for concern, and has been inferred by several population - level studies using various molecular and biochemical markers, such as blood - group systems and blood serum proteins ( Sipko et al.

Overall, the wisent captive breeding program, based on a founding herd of just 12 individuals, appears to have succeeded in retaining reasonable levels of genetic variability in modern populations.

Nevertheless, the extinction of wisent in the wild was clearly accompanied by a major loss of total genetic diversity.	"wisent	32	38	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Divergent mitochondrial haplotypes detected in ancient wisent appear to have been entirely lost from modern populations, which our results suggest may possess only a single haplotype.

Moreover, substantial pairwise nuclear genomic divergences detected between modern and historical Caucasian wisent indicate a huge loss of diversity following the extinction of the latter population.

While the temporal behavior of specific network - pair correlations might be of interest in certain narrowly tailored questions, it seems natural to address complex brain diseases that encompass diverse categories and combinations of symptoms at a more aggregated level, examining how patterns or aggregates of network - pair correlations evolve en masse in afflicted populations.

Schizophrenia is such a disease, and at the whole - brain level, we find very robust evidence of reduced dynamic fluidity and range in network correlation structure for patients suffering from this varied and complex disorder.

The simultaneous weighted contributions, called meta - states, of whole - brain patterns of connectivity to subject wFNCs change less often, and shift between a smaller number of more similar meta - states in schizophrenia patients than in healthy controls ( Fig 2 ( D )).

Our meta - state dynamical framework exposes important features of whole - brain connectivity dynamics that seem to emerge specifically at this level of analysis; network timecourses [ 1 ], windowed network timecourses, and even individual network - pair wFNC values, for example, exhibit more high - frequency power in schizophrenia patients than in controls, a phenomenon that dissolves the whole brain meta - state level ( see Discussion section ).

It is also the case that patients move significantly more smoothly through the state space than do healthy controls, ie. the average L1 distance between successive meta - states is smaller in the patient population ( SZ Effect = - 0. 08, P - value = 3. 04 e - 008 ).

For schizophrenia patients this problem is more pronounced since they realize fewer meta - states, change meta - state less often and remain trapped in a smaller radial neighborhood of their arbitrary starting point.	"schizophrenia	4	17	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""schizophrenia"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
This makes it all the more interesting to note that pairs of schizophrenia patients are significantly more likely to have trajectories that intersect than are healthy controls.

Schizophrenia patients, for example, tend to have a larger number of relatively more absorbing hub states than controls.	"Schizophrenia	0	13	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Schizophrenia"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Although not statistically significant, it is also the case that the directional effect of schizophrenia diagnosis on the number and span of states that are the outgoing targets of hubs is positive ( Fig 13 ).

Locally, in the immediate neighborhood of hubs, the schizophrenia patients seem slightly more dynamic than controls, while globally they are significantly less so.

Schizophrenia is a complex illness that presents with enormous variation of symptom combinations and intensities, and its effects on resting fMRI are commensurately complex.

Such studies have yielded consistent evidence that at both voxel and network levels that the signals of schizophrenia patients contain more high frequency content than healthy controls [ 1, 47 ].

Many of these findings appear to hold even when the stationarity assumption is lifted as evidenced by significantly more negative SZ timecourse values ( Fig 14) for CPs that feature strong positive intra - AVSN correlations and strong negative SC - to - AVSN connections ( Fig 4 ( A ), Top row ).

For example, the window - wise spectrum of windowed network timecourses in schizophrenia patients have more high frequency content than those of healthy controls ( Fig 15 ).	"schizophrenia	75	88	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""schizophrenia"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In the timecourses of individual wFNC network - pair correlations, schizophrenia patients also exhibit greater high frequency power, though the effect is weaker statistically than for network and voxel timecourses ( Fig 15, first three columns ).

Shen et al [ 54] have reported mixed effects of SZ on low - frequency power in windowed network - pair correlation timeseries, with patients exhibiting less low frequency power than controls in DMN - to - sensorimotor and DMN - to - cerebellum connections.

EEG microstate studies [ 55 – 58] that identify common patterns of millisecond - scale activation from spatially segmented brain regions also indicate a higher rate of pattern - shifting among schizophrenia patients.

In contrast, our investigation of whole - brain ensembles of network - pair correlations has yielded highly robust findings of diminished connectivity dynamism for schizophrenia patients.	"schizophrenia	164	177	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""schizophrenia"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 177, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
These findings are consistent with recent results on dynamic graph metrics, which inherently involve ensembles of nodal connections [ 59] and with the disappearance of positive high - frequency spectral SZ effects on ensemble - scale timeseries ( Fig 15, last two columns ).

It seems possible, for example that the consistent findings [ 1, 7, 48 – 53] of diminished connectivity strength and weakened connectome - wide modularity among schizophrenia patients reflect a degradation of communication pathways that enable rapid and widespread reorganization of network relationships.

Twelve patients with posterior corona radiata infarction underwent diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI) and an executive functional assessment at week 1 ( W1 ), week 4 ( W4 ), and week 12 ( W12) after onset.

This study demonstrates that DTI detected secondary damage in left - sided frontal white matter in patients with acute infarction at the ipsilateral posterior corona radiata.

Lesions of not only the prefrontal cortex but subcortical areas result in executive dysfunction [ 4 ],[ 5 ].	"executive dysfunction	74	95	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""executive dysfunction"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In particular, damage of frontal white matter, which is an important region in frontal - subcortical circuitry, results in this executive dysfunction [ 6 ].

For example, after cerebral infarction in the middle cerebral artery ( MCA) territory, neuronal and / or axonal degeneration, loss, dysfunction and gliosis have been found in the ipsilateral thalamus, substantia nigra, and distal pyramidal tract, all of which were remote from the MCA territory [ 7 ]–[ 12 ].	"cerebral infarction	19	38	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cerebral infarction"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The disruption of frontal - subcortical circuitry was considered to be responsible for this executive dysfunction.	"executive dysfunction	92	113	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""executive dysfunction"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Moreover, the underlying pathogenesis, especially whether secondary damage in other areas, such as frontal white matter in frontal - subcortical circuitry, due to anterograde and / or retrograde degeneration following focal corona radiata infarction, is a causal phenomenon and is involved in the dysfunction, is still uncertain.

For example, progressive decreased fractional anisotropy ( FA) values in the pyramidal tract, proximal and distal to a subcortical cerebral infarct or pontine infarct over 1 to 12 weeks, were found; this means important loss of structural components in the pyramidal tract above and below the primary infarcts [ 11 ],[ 12 ].

There was also no significant change of blood flow in the frontal area between W1 and W12 in patients as measured by the evaluation of carotid artery stenosis and hemodynamics of ACA, MCA and PCA performed with Color duplex sonography and TCD, suggesting that frontal dysfunction would not be attributed to potential hemodynamic changes.

Kinetic characterization of the Pi uptake system of whole plants [ 10 ], [ 11] and cultured cells [ 12] suggests a high - affinity transport operating in the low micromolar range and a low - affinity system operating at higher concentrations ( millimolar range) [ 7 ], [ 13 ], [ 14 ], [ 15 ], [ 16 ].

After uptake into the roots, Pi is mainly translocated symplastically to the xylem parenchyma cells, and secretion into the xylem for long - distance translocation to the shoot is facilitated by another type of transporter - like protein [ 8 ], [ 17 ].

In Pi - starved plants, however, the limited supply of Pi from roots to shoots is augmented by increased mobilization of stored Pi in older leaves and retranslocation to both younger leaves and growing roots, from where Pi can again be recycled to the shoot [ 18 ].

Due to the prominence and uniqueness of the catalytic domain for the DGK family of proteins, analysis of its sequence provides an important resource for gaining an understanding of the evolution of this protein family as well as functional differences among its members.	"DGK	69	72	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DGK"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Our analyses of the catalytic domain sequences presented here have identified many novel sequence features that are specific for different types of DGKs and provide useful insights into the evolution of this protein family.

In a phylogenetic tree based on CD sequences, DGK homologs belonging to different classes formed strongly supported clusters, which were separated by long branches.	"DGK	46	49	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DGK"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
A large number of sequence motifs or signatures, in the forms of CSIs, have been identified in the present work and a summary of the identified CSIs, their DGK class specificity and location within the catalytic domain is provided in Fig 8.

As seen from Fig 8, DGK homologs of all five classes can be clearly distinguished from each other by the presence of specific CSIs that are uniquely found in them.	"DGK	20	23	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DGK"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
For class I, class III, class IV and class V DGK homologs, multiple CSIs specific for these groups were identified.	"class V DGK	37	48	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""class V DGK"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The sequence region in the CD where this large CSI is found in class II homologs, it is flanked on both sides by several residues that are conserved in all DGK homologs.	"DGK	156	159	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DGK"", ""start_span"": 156, ""end_span"": 159, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Within this conserved region, CSIs of specific lengths ( Sig ❻, ❽ and ❽A) which are distinctive characteristics of the other classes of DGK homologs are also found.	"DGK	136	139	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DGK"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Another noteworthy CSI within the CD is a 16 – 24 aa insert ( Sig ❶ in Fig 3) that is uniquely found in all of the Class I DGK homologs.	"Class I DGK	115	126	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Class I DGK"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Some of the identified CSIs were also commonly shared by members from two different DGK types.	"DGK	84	87	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DGK"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
For example, the CSI in Sig ❹ ( Fig 5) is commonly shared by class I and IV, and also possibly class V ( Sig ❺ ), DGK homologs.	"DGK	114	117	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DGK"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
A closer relationship between class I and IV homologs is also suggested by Sig❷A, B, where inserts that are either 2 aa or 4 aa long are specifically present in these two classes of DGK homologs and by the observed branching pattern of these homologs in the phylogenetic tree.	"DGK	182	185	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DGK"", ""start_span"": 182, ""end_span"": 185, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In another instance ( Sig❿A, B ), CSIs of different lengths ( 3 aa and 4 aa) in the same position are a uniquely present in theε - and θ - classes of DGK - homologs.	"DGK	150	153	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DGK"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Different lengths of CSIs in the same position in specific classes of DGK homologs can results from several possibilities.	"DGK	70	73	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DGK"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
First, it is possible that independent genetic changes have occurred in the ancestor ( s) of specific DGK classes, giving rise to CSIs of different lengths.	"DGK	102	105	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DGK"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
However, in some cases such as Sig❷A, B ( and also Sig❿A, B ), it is also possible that initially a genetic change leading to either 2 aa or 4 aa insert occurred in a common ancestor of the class I and IV DGK homologs, and then another insertion or deletion event occurred in the same position in the ancestor of one of these two groups leading to the observed differences in the lengths of the CSIs in these two classes.	"DGK	205	208	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DGK"", ""start_span"": 205, ""end_span"": 208, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Although it is difficult to distinguish between these two possibilities, the fact that the class I and class IV DGK homologs also contain another uniquely shared CSI ( viz.	"class IV DGK	103	115	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""class IV DGK"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
There is limited understanding at present concerning the overall function of the catalytic domain for eukaryotic DGKs [ 1 – 5, 31 ].	"DGKs	113	117	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DGKs"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Some differences have been recently reported in the activities of different classes of DGKs towards 1 - monoacylglycerol and 2 - monoacylglycerol [ 11 ].	"DGKs	87	91	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DGKs"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The catalytic domain contains a highly - conserved sequence motif ( G - X - G - X - X - G) similar to that present in the ATP - binding sites of other protein kinases [ 2, 31, 32 ].	"protein kinases	151	166	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""protein kinases"", ""start_span"": 151, ""end_span"": 166, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The importance of this motif for the functioning of DGKs has been established by mutational studies [ 2, 31, 37 ].	"DGKs	52	56	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DGKs"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
This and other observations have led to the suggestion that the proper functioning of the CD for mammalian DGKs requires interactions with other motifs ( proteins) [ 1 – 5, 31 ].	"DGKs	107	111	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DGKs"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
However, our knowledge of the sequence motifs in the CD that may facilitate its interactions with other proteins / effectors molecules, and how different DGK isozymes, or classes of isozymes, differ in this regard is very limited.	"DGK	154	157	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DGK"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The lack of structural information for the CD for eukaryotic DGKs is also a major hindrance in understanding its function.	"DGKs	61	65	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DGKs"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In this context, our identification of multiples CSIs within the CD that are specific for different classes of DGK homologs is of much interest and significance.	"DGK	111	114	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DGK"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Thus, further studies on understanding the cellular functions of the identified CSIs, and the specific interactions that they may be involved in, could provide important insights regarding the biochemical basis of the differences in the functions of different DGK isozymes.	"DGK	260	263	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DGK"", ""start_span"": 260, ""end_span"": 263, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In this context, the CSIs identified in the present work, which are specific for different classes of DGK homologs and predicted to play important roles in the cellular functions of these isoforms, thus provide potentially useful drug targets [ 58 ].

After peripheral nerve injury, motor and sensory axons are able to regenerate but inaccuracy of target reinnervation leads to poor functional recovery.

Here, we assessed in vitro and in vivo the selective effects of combining different ECM components with NTFs on motor and sensory axons regeneration and target reinnervation.	"NTFs	104	108	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NTFs"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Therefore, combination of ECM molecules with NTFs may be a good approach to selectively enhance motor and sensory axons regeneration and promote appropriate target reinnervation.	"NTFs	45	49	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NTFs"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
After peripheral nerve injury, transected axons in the distal stump are disconnected from the neuronal body and undergo Wallerian degeneration, thus leading to denervation of peripheral organs [ 1 ].

However, the majority of the studies have only investigated the effect of these molecules individually, disregarding the synergistic interactions of ECM molecules with NTFs [ 20 ].

Therefore, in this study, we tested whether the combination of different NTFs and ECM components, that were previously shown to produce a selective although limited stimulus for either sensory or motor axons regeneration [ 14, 21 ], was able to produce a synergistic and selective pro - regenerative effect on motor and sensory neurons.

For this purpose, we compared groups of rats similar to the short term study but leaving an 8 mm gap between stumps, since this more challenging gap allows to better elucidate differences between groups [ 22 ], and applying the FG retrotracer to the tibial nerve at the ankle at 75 dpi.

In all the rats PGP immunolabeling showed regenerated nerve fibers that surrounded the SG tubules, reached the subepidermal nerve plexus, and extended to intraepidermal terminals and Meissner corpuscles at the papillae ( Figure 4E – J ).

These proregenerative effects may be mediated by the differential expression of integrin and NTF receptors in regenerating neurons.	"NTF receptors	93	106	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NTF receptors"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
It can be hypothesized that the partially selective in vitro effects of NTFs may be enhanced by the presence of certain ECM molecules in the substrate.	"NTFs	72	76	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NTFs"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

Therefore, the in vivo implant of a matrix containing ECM components and NTFs in the nerve conduit does not only influence the injured neurons, but also acts on the migrating non - neuronal cells inside the intratubular matrix.

Because of too little fat, fat - invisible AML was defined having a TSR ≥ 0. 71 and a SII ≤ 16. 5% [ 910 ].	"AML	43	46	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
A mislocation or inappropriate size of the ROI may change the type of AML, with misclassification and unwanted procedures as a result.	"AML	70	73	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
For example, if an AML is measured – 9 HU at one CT scanner, it will be classified as fat - poor.	"AML	19	22	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
First, the authors divided renal AMLs into sporadic and hereditary.	"renal AMLs	27	37	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""renal AMLs"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Histologically, they classified sporadic AMLs into benign triphasic type and potentially malignant epithelioid type [ 34 ].	"AMLs	41	45	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AMLs"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Benign triphasic type was further divided into fat - rich and fat - poor AML using imaging modalities.	"AML	73	76	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Hyperattenuating AML was hyperattenuating compared to renal parenchyma on UECT (> 45 HU ), homogeneously enhancing on contrast enhanced CT, and T2 - hypointense on MRI.	"AML	17	20	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
On the contrary, isoattenuating AML was characterized by attenuation numbers close to renal parenchyma on UECT ( between – 10 and 45 HU ).	"AML	32	35	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
These lower attenuation levels were caused by the presence of fat cells, sufficient in quantity to lower the overall attenuation relative to hyperattenuating AMLs, but too few in one area to be detected on regular imaging.	"AMLs	158	162	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AMLs"", ""start_span"": 158, ""end_span"": 162, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Epithelioid AMLs, that can be potentially malignant and metastasize, showed hyperattenuation on UECT, heterogeneously enhancement on contrast enhanced CT, and T2 - hypointensity on MRI.	"AMLs	12	16	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AMLs"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Second, there are problems in applying the imaging criteria for classifying isoattenuating AML.	"AML	91	94	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Furthermore, the authors did not suggest a quantitative threshold for CSI - MRI, which means that radiologists cannot classify AML using TSR or SII [ 9 ].	"AML	127	130	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Radiologists can categorize renal AMLs as fat - rich, fat - poor, and fat - invisible, according to the amount of fat detected on UECT or CSI - MRI.	"renal AMLs	28	38	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""renal AMLs"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
However, attention should be paid to fit the ROI within the right area of the fat tissue, otherwise many fat - rich or fat - poor AMLs may be misclassified as fat - poor or fat - invisible.	"AMLs	130	134	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AMLs"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

The increased use of cross - sectional imaging and advances in imaging technology explain that the majority (> 80 %) of AMLs are now incidentally found.	"AMLs	120	124	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AMLs"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Most patients are asymptomatic when they receive the diagnosis of an AML [ 2 ].	"AML	69	72	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Therefore, risk of a life - threatening bleeding is the main clinical concern in a patient diagnosed with AML.	"AML	106	109	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In contrast to the benign prognosis of classic renal AMLs, the epithelioid variant may undergo malignant transformation, although this is rare.	"renal AMLs	47	57	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""renal AMLs"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
This is manifested by local aggressiveness, including lymphadenopathy, and distal metastases.	"lymphadenopathy	54	69	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""lymphadenopathy"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
About 90% of patients with TSC have skin manifestations, with a range from facial angiofibromas to hypomelanotic macules.	"TSC	27	30	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""TSC"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Typical renal AML can be diagnosed accurately based on imaging findings.	"renal AML	8	17	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""renal AML"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
However, AML represent a diagnostic challenge for every imaging method in case of haemorrhage, calcification, necrosis, or low fat content.	"AML	9	12	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
All imaging features of renal AML are summarized in Table 2.	"renal AML	24	33	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""renal AML"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Fat - rich AML	"AML	11	14	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Fat - poor AML	"AML	11	14	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Fat - invisible AML	"AML	16	19	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The classical appearance of a fat - rich AML on ultrasound ( US) is that of a hyperechoic lesion with a posterior acoustic shadow ( Figure 1 ).	"AML	41	44	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The hyperechoic nature of a classic AML is the result of the combination of its fat, blood vessel, and muscle contents, while the shadowing is due to the multiple tissue interfaces between those different elements [ 11 ].	"AML	36	39	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Fat - poor AML has a mixed echotexture, being hyperechoic and isoechoic compared with renal parenchyma.	"AML	11	14	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Fat - invisible AML is homogenously isoechoic with respect to renal parenchyma.	"AML	16	19	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The echogenicity of both tumours is less than that of the renal sinus.	"tumours	25	32	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumours"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
It is challenging to differentiate them from other renal lesions such as RCC, which has an echogenicity that is also less than that of the renal sinus [ 3410 ].	"RCC	73	76	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""RCC"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The lack of sensitivity of US at defining small renal masses implicates that the diagnostic reliability of this imaging modality is not high enough to allow it to be used for diagnosing renal AMLs in daily practice [ 211 ].	"renal AMLs	186	196	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""renal AMLs"", ""start_span"": 186, ""end_span"": 196, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
US image showing a fat - rich AML ( arrow ).	"AML	30	33	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
As on US, the characteristics of AMLs on UECT may vary due to variable quantities of angiogenic, myogenic, and fatty elements.	"AMLs	33	37	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AMLs"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Therefore, detecting fat is feasible in most fat - rich AMLs ( Figure 2 ).	"AMLs	56	60	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AMLs"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
However, some fat - rich AMLs contain very small areas of fat, which may not be recognized at CT.	"AMLs	25	29	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AMLs"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In fat - poor AMLs, UECT cannot show a hypoattenuating area measuring less than – 10 HU.	"AMLs	14	18	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AMLs"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
For this reason, fat - poor AMLs are heterogeneously isoattenuating or hyperattenuating.	"AMLs	28	32	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AMLs"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
On the contrary, fat - invisible AMLs appear homogenously hyperattenuating ( Figure 3 ).	"AMLs	33	37	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AMLs"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Each lesion contains attenuation numbers less than – 10 HU, consistent with fat - rich AML [ 3 ].	"AML	87	90	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
It appears homogeneously hyperdense and has attenuation values as high as 44 HU, consistent with fat - invisible AML [ 9 ].	"AML	113	116	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
There are several other variants in which an AML can appear on UECT.	"AML	45	48	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
However, several authors reported the existence of both AMLs with calcification and RCCs having fat without calcification [ 111314 ].	"AMLs	56	60	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AMLs"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Another, less frequent appearance is that of necrosis within a lesion, being rather typical for epithelioid AMLs [ 34 ].	"AMLs	108	112	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AMLs"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Contrast - enhanced CT is not routinely indicated in diagnosing renal AMLs, but should be performed in selected cases.	"renal AMLs	64	74	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""renal AMLs"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Frequently, large AMLs contain dilated blood vessels that have the potential of rupturing and bleeding.	"AMLs	18	22	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AMLs"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In the diagnosis of AML, MRI is equivalent in accuracy to CT.	"AML	20	23	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
A classic fat - rich AML appears T1 - hypointense with and T1 - hyperintense without fat suppression [ 234 ].	"AML	21	24	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Moreover, fat - invisible AMLs contain too little fat to show any hypointensity on fat - suppressed T1 - weighted images.	"AMLs	26	30	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AMLs"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
More recently, the application of MRI artefacts has been suggested to evaluate fat in renal tumours.	"renal tumours	86	99	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""renal tumours"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
This artificially created black line is located at the junction of fat ( present in AML cells) and water ( present in renal parenchyma) and results in a sharp delineation of the muscle - fat boundary ( Figure 5 ).	"AML	84	87	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
This sign is indicative of an AML [ 341116 ].	"AML	30	33	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
It is especially useful in fat - poor AMLs and very small lesions, in which the typical T1 features may not be noticeable [ 2 ].	"AMLs	38	42	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AMLs"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
However, fat - invisible AMLs do not show this decrease in signal intensity, because they contain too little fat cells [ 10 ].	"AMLs	25	29	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AMLs"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
T2 - weighted images can also be used for diagnosing AML.	"AML	53	56	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Fat - rich AML typically is hyperintense with respect to renal parenchyma.	"AML	11	14	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Fat - poor AML is either homogeneous or heterogeneous hypointense compared with renal tissue, depending on the distribution of its areas of fat.	"AML	11	14	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Finally, fat - invisible AML is homogeneously hypointense in comparison to renal parenchyma on T2, because of the dominance of the muscle component and the paucity of adipose tissue [ 23410 ].	"AML	25	28	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Contrast - enhanced MRI has a limited role in the diagnosis of AML.	"AML	63	66	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
After intravenous administration of gadolinium, renal AMLs show hypointense compared to renal parenchyma.	"renal AMLs	48	58	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""renal AMLs"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Most AMLs can be diagnosed with imaging by identifying intralesional fat.	"AMLs	5	9	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AMLs"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
A fat - invisible AML typically appears as a hyperattenuating mass that enhance homogenously on UECT.	"AML	18	21	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Although this presentation is uncommon for a RCC, both pathologies may appear identical on imaging.	"RCC	45	48	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""RCC"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
However, the papillary subtype of RCC appears also hypointense.	"RCC	34	37	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""RCC"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
A lot of these incidentally found renal lesions are usually presumed to be RCC and are treated as such.	"RCC	75	78	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""RCC"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
AML accounted for nearly half of this group of benign masses.	"AML	0	3	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Correctly diagnosing this fat - poor and fat - invisible AML requires sufficient clinical and imaging information.	"AML	57	60	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Clinical information supporting a diagnosis of AML includes a younger age, female sex, and asymptomatic presentation.	"AML	47	50	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Imaging findings that should raise the suspicion of AML include the absence of calcification, the absence of perinephric collateral vessels, multiple lesions, hyperattenuation in comparison to renal parenchyma on UECT, and hypointensity on T2 - weighted MRI.	"AML	52	55	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
As most renal AMLs are diagnosed incidentally in asymptomatic patients, therapeutic interventions are required in a minority of patients.	"renal AMLs	8	18	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""renal AMLs"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Potential interventions include selective renal artery embolization, nephron - sparing surgery, complete nephrectomy, cryo - and radiofrequency ablation, and treatment with mTOR inhibitors.

The authors of this review reported that 82% of patients with renal AMLs larger than 4 cm experienced symptoms and 51% of them presented with active retroperitoneal haemorrhage.	"renal AMLs	62	72	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""renal AMLs"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Other early series showed that patients with tumours larger than 4 cm had interval growth and needed treatment more often.	"tumours	45	52	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumours"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
One author found that only 30% of AMLs larger than 4 cm were symptomatic [ 2 ].	"AMLs	34	38	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AMLs"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Another one showed that using a cut - off of 4 cm as predictor of haemorrhage has a lower specificity than an aneurysm size of 5 mm.	"aneurysm	110	118	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""aneurysm"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In other series, the angiographic appearance of AMLs was used for analysing them.	"AMLs	48	52	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AMLs"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Consequently, AMLs are often imaged intensively and repeatedly, and treated empirically once they attain a diameter of 4 cm [ 26 ].	"AMLs	14	18	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AMLs"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The current guidelines of the European Association of Urology recommend intervention in well - selected cases, including symptomatic tumours, large lesions, presence in women of childbearing age, and poor access to follow - up or emergency care.

Once the initial diagnostic evaluations are completed and indications for treatment are not present, active surveillance should be used to monitor progression of known tumours and development of new ones [ 29 ].

For sporadic AML, there are currently no guidelines on the frequency of imaging studies neither on which modality should be used.	"AML	13	16	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Historically, there was a greater tendency towards surgery in the treatment of renal AMLs.	"renal AMLs	79	89	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""renal AMLs"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
However, this has shifted, as AMLs can now be confidently recognized at imaging.	"AMLs	30	34	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AMLs"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Many clinicians favour embolization and reserve surgery for patients with uncontrollable symptoms, vascular malformations, failure of embolization, and rare diagnostic uncertainty.

When surgery needs to be performed, preoperative embolization of the lesion may be taken into consideration in reducing the difficulty and complications of tumourectomy or nephrectomy [ 11192732 ].

This self - limiting condition is characterized by fever, flank pain, leucocytosis, nausea, and vomiting within the first three days after the procedure, and it is managed conservatively with standard supportive care.

Although it is now seen as the first - line treatment for patients with AMLs, both regrowth and repeated haemorrhage after embolization remain a concern.	"AMLs	72	76	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AMLs"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Nephrectomy is indicated only when a renal AML is very large, when suspicion of malignancy is high, and when other treatment options cannot be performed.	"renal AML	37	46	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""renal AML"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Little evidence is available on the application in larger or symptomatic tumours.	"tumours	73	80	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumours"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Overall, ablation has shown some promise in the treatment of a specific AML group that some would say should be managed by active surveillance [ 23334 ].	"AML	72	75	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Another concern for treating physicians is how long the treatment with those drugs should continue, as the effect of mTOR inhibition is reversible.	"mTOR	117	121	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""mTOR"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

b Subgroup analysis performed on the sample of studies that targeted primary prevention ( including diabetes control ).	"diabetes	100	108	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""diabetes"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In this systematic review and meta - analysis, we found for people with elevated cardiovascular risk, Web - based interventions lead to improvement of systolic and diastolic BP, HbA1c, weight, LDL cholesterol, physical activity levels, and cardiovascular risk composite scores.	"cholesterol	197	208	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cholesterol"", ""start_span"": 197, ""end_span"": 208, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Effects were more pronounced over the short term ( study duration < 12 months) and in studies that tested a blended intervention ( combination of an Internet application and human support ).	"human	174	179	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 174, ""end_span"": 179, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We found no evidence for an effect on incident cardiovascular disease.	"cardiovascular disease	47	69	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cardiovascular disease"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
We found a reduction of LDL cholesterol of 2. 18 mg / dL ( converted = 0. 06 mmol / L ).	"cholesterol	28	39	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cholesterol"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Theoretically, assuming a linear relation, a reduction of 0. 06 mmol / L could lead to a 2. 4% reduction of coronary heart disease events.	"coronary heart disease	108	130	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""coronary heart disease"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Thus, the effects on Internet interventions on BP reduction and, to a lesser extent, LDL cholesterol reduction, can be clinically relevant at the population level if reductions are maintained.	"cholesterol	89	100	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cholesterol"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In addition, we evaluated the effect on the complete cardiovascular risk profile and prevention of cardiovascular disease, which has not been performed before.	"cardiovascular disease	99	121	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cardiovascular disease"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
We found that the beneficial effects of Web - based interventions decline over time and effects are larger when interventions are combined with human support.	"human	144	149	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Our results do not show a beneficial effect of Web - based interventions on incident cardiovascular disease.	"cardiovascular disease	85	107	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cardiovascular disease"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
By pooling the effect sizes on all different cardiovascular risk factors, we aimed to assess the overall effect of an Internet - based approach for people with increased risk of cardiovascular disease.	"cardiovascular disease	178	200	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cardiovascular disease"", ""start_span"": 178, ""end_span"": 200, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Therefore, the external validity of the results might be acceptable and may be generalizable to middle - aged to older primary care populations with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.	"cardiovascular disease	170	192	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cardiovascular disease"", ""start_span"": 170, ""end_span"": 192, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
On the macro level, trials can assess sustainability by prolonging follow - up, recording clinical events, and measuring surrogate cardiovascular outcomes ( eg, BP, cholesterol levels, and weight) at multiple time points ( eg, at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months ).	"cholesterol	165	176	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cholesterol"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Sustainability is of particular importance because long - term effects are required for primary and secondary prevention to truly contribute to the prevention of cardiovascular disease.	"cardiovascular disease	162	184	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cardiovascular disease"", ""start_span"": 162, ""end_span"": 184, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Web - based interventions combined with human support are more promising than Internet - only interventions.	"human	40	45	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
