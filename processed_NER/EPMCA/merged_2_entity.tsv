This delay was reduced to 21 min when the cells were sampled 1 h after glucose exhaustion, likely because of the induced expression of gluconeogenic enzymes.	glucose,71,78,Chemical/Drug	gluconeogenic enzymes,135,156,Gene/Protein	"[{""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""gluconeogenic enzymes"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"	test

Since the glycogen level in the csrBC mutant strain was zero after glucose exhaustion ( Fig. 1D ), we conclude that glycogen is necessary to start acetate uptake 1 h after glucose exhaustion.	glucose,67,74,Chemical/Drug	glucose,172,179,Chemical/Drug	"[{""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 172, ""end_span"": 179, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"	test
Therefore, the Csr system affects the establishment of metabolic adaptation after glucose exhaustion through its control of glycogen synthesis.

The control by CsrA could also be counterbalanced by its higher sequestration by CsrB, since the latter level has been reported to increase during the transition ( 23, 37 ).

Most importantly, CsrA was demonstrated to control the expression of genes encoding functions in acetate and glycogen metabolism after glucose exhaustion.

This gene expression profiling, combined with acetate measurements and switch experiments, demonstrated that CsrA influences the timing of acetate and glycogen utilization after glucose exhaustion.

Indeed, a csrA51 mutant strain induced cAMP production after glucose exhaustion, but the levels were about five times lower than in the WT ( Fig. 5A ).	csrA51,10,16,Gene/Protein	glucose,61,68,Chemical/Drug	"[{""token"": ""csrA51"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"	test
However, the csrA51 ΔglgC mutant strain presents the same phenotype, proving that this lower cAMP level does not result from the greater glycogen content and is therefore directly linked to CsrA activity.	csrA51,13,19,Gene/Protein	CsrA,190,194,Gene/Protein	"[{""token"": ""csrA51"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""CsrA"", ""start_span"": 190, ""end_span"": 194, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"	test
This phenotype is very likely explained by the fact that glycolysis is still supplied in G6P by glycogen after glucose exhaustion in the csrA51 mutant and this could impair / prevent the establishment of gluconeogenic metabolism.	glucose,111,118,Chemical/Drug	csrA51,137,143,Gene/Protein	"[{""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""csrA51"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"	test

The amount of available information regarding medication use in EU countries was somewhat limited; however available evidence from the literature suggests that, despite the availability of European Guidelines for the management of HZ [ 80, 81 ], medication prescribing practices ( for the treatment of PHN in particular) are not consistent across countries [ 14, 21, 25, 29, 44, 50 ].

Genomic blocks in the LC line wisent ( red) result from admixture occurring around 90 years ago; the lower abundance of larger admixed blocks in the modern L line wisent support that this admixture event preceded the former.	wisent,30,36,Organism/Species	wisent,163,169,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 163, ""end_span"": 169, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	test

We find evidence of at least two highly differentiated populations within Caucasian wisent, with one of these showing greater pairwise similarities with Lowland wisent than with the second Caucasian population, at the level of the complete genome ( fig. 2 ).

Thus, among any two Caucasian wisent and any two modern ( or founding Lowland) wisent, we may expect that any single locus has only around 50% probability of reflecting the true history of population divergence.

Our results also demonstrate that the notion of wisent subspecies purity is flawed in the sense that founding Lowland individuals were in fact admixed with Caucasian wisent to varying degrees.	wisent,48,54,Organism/Species	Caucasian wisent,156,172,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Caucasian wisent"", ""start_span"": 156, ""end_span"": 172, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	test
We demonstrate this, both directly for the founder PLANTA in comparison to another founder, her son PLATEN, and also indirectly, by the elevated signal of Caucasian wisent admixture in modern L line wisent, relative to these founders, most likely a result of inheritance from other founding individuals not included in this analysis ( fig. 7 ).

The notion of subspecies purity therefore disregards the fact that admixture between Caucasian and Lowland wisent almost certainly occurred prior to the extinction of wisent in the wild, and such admixture could therefore be regarded as part of the normal population processes and dynamics of this species.

Some individuals were found to possess a microsatellite allele that was common among Caucasian wisent but absent in all studied Lowland wisent, which these authors interpreted as evidence of recent admixture with the modern LC line.

In apparent contrast to these results, whole - genome heterozygosity in modern wisent has been shown to be similar to that found within domestic cow breeds ( Gautier et al.	wisent,79,85,Organism/Species	domestic cow,136,148,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""domestic cow"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	test
However, the bimodal distributions observed for pairwise comparisons based on transitions and transversions for modern wisent suggests that, among any pair of modern wisent, large chromosomal blocks will show high genetic similarity, which is indicative of inbreeding, and has been shown previously using SNP array data ( Pertoldi et al.	wisent,119,125,Organism/Species	wisent,166,172,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 166, ""end_span"": 172, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	test
Our study demonstrates that, at least in principle, by generating chromosomal admixture maps for multiple living representatives of the LC line, it would be possible to selectively breed an animal that is, at the genomic level, highly similar to a Caucasian wisent.	animal,190,196,Organism/Species	Caucasian wisent,248,264,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""animal"", ""start_span"": 190, ""end_span"": 196, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Caucasian wisent"", ""start_span"": 248, ""end_span"": 264, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	test

We extend this result by demonstrating that such admixture is widespread across wisent, including both modern genetic lines, representatives of the original founding herd, and also extinct Caucasian wisent.	wisent,80,86,Organism/Species	Caucasian wisent,189,205,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Caucasian wisent"", ""start_span"": 189, ""end_span"": 205, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	test

The described signatures are uniquely present in all members of the indicated classes from vertebrate species ( the main focus of the present work) indicating that the genetic changes responsible for these CSIs first occurred in the ancestors of specific DGK isoforms, and they were then retained in the descendent species.	vertebrate,91,101,Organism/Species	DGK,255,258,Gene/Protein	"[{""token"": ""vertebrate"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""DGK"", ""start_span"": 255, ""end_span"": 258, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"	test
Further, according to the definition of the CSI ( s) used in our work, the large insert (> 300 aa) within the class II DGK members [ 2 – 6, 12 ], also represents a CSI ( marked as Sig ❼) specific for the class II DGK homologs.	class II DGK,110,122,Gene/Protein	class II DGK,204,216,Gene/Protein	"[{""token"": ""class II DGK"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""class II DGK"", ""start_span"": 204, ""end_span"": 216, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"	test

The CSIs in protein sequences provide another useful means for understanding the evolutionary relationships among distantly related species; however, in the present instance, due to the absence of a suitable outgroup, it was difficult to establish the ancestral state of the DGK protein sequence and reliably infer whether the observed CSIs are insertions or deletions in the indicated classes of DGK homologs.

An adaptive explanation is that only good food conditions enable the host to lay many eggs and therefore the parasite to have efficient vertical transmission; the potential for vertical transmission decreases as larval growth slows, making the mosquitoes more attractive to exploitation for horizontal transmission [ 19, 20 ].	parasite,109,117,Organism/Species	mosquitoes,244,254,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""parasite"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""mosquitoes"", ""start_span"": 244, ""end_span"": 254, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	train

This microsporidium, a specific parasite of Ae. aegypti, has a complex life cycle ( Fig. 1) involving horizontal and vertical transmission [ 36 – 40] and using two types of morphologically distinguishable spores: uninucleate spores for horizontal transmission and binucleate spores for vertical transmission.	microsporidium,5,19,Organism/Species	parasite,32,40,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""microsporidium"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""parasite"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	train

Moreover, the results above also suggest that suf and momL are not combined together randomly, but rather, that this special arrangement allows two otherwise unrelated survival mechanisms to be activated by the same environmental stimuli, enhancing cell survival.	suf,46,49,Gene/Protein	momL,54,58,Gene/Protein	"[{""token"": ""suf"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""momL"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"	train

Tumour heterogeneity represents a key issue in CT perfusion ( CTp ), where all studies are usually based on global mean or median values of perfusion maps, often computed on whole tumour.

Through the analysis of TCCs, it is possible to achieve colorimetric maps representing values of perfusion parameters that can be used for multiple purposes such as monitoring vascular changes after the administration of antiangiogenic drugs [ 3 ], predicting tumour response [ 4, 5 ], or differentiating tumour subtypes [ 6 ].	tumour,260,266,Disease/Disorder	tumour,305,311,Disease/Disorder	"[{""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 260, ""end_span"": 266, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 305, ""end_span"": 311, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"	train
Indeed, when investigating the possible clinical applications, tumour heterogeneity, representativeness of tumour regions, reliability of results, and reproducibility of CTp examinations represent different as well as interconnected issues that should be addressed as a whole.	tumour,63,69,Disease/Disorder	tumour,107,113,Disease/Disorder	"[{""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"	train
Nevertheless, very few attempts have been made to try assessing the capability of CTp parameters to evaluate the treatment response of patients with non - small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ), but the lack of reproducibility could not confirm the results.	non - small cell lung cancer,149,177,Disease/Disorder	NSCLC,180,185,Disease/Disorder	"[{""token"": ""non - small cell lung cancer"", ""start_span"": 149, ""end_span"": 177, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""NSCLC"", ""start_span"": 180, ""end_span"": 185, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"	train
Also, they concluded that entropy only, computed on the Hounsfield units ( HU ), could be considered as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival ( OS ), this suggesting the importance of tumour heterogeneity in assessing tumour aggressiveness.	tumour,200,206,Disease/Disorder	tumour,234,240,Disease/Disorder	"[{""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 200, ""end_span"": 206, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 234, ""end_span"": 240, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"	train

Then, a second analysis was executed to assess whether some slices exist with the same mean or median global BF values as the whole tumour, so as to find out which perfusion pattern, at several levels, is represented by the global values of whole tumours.	tumour,132,138,Disease/Disorder	tumours,247,254,Disease/Disorder	"[{""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""tumours"", ""start_span"": 247, ""end_span"": 254, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"	train

In fact, they were applied to test, for each lesion, the difference of means and medians, respectively, between each slice and the whole tumour, with the purpose to check whether a slice exists which can represent the whole tumour ( i. e ., having the same global value ).	tumour,137,143,Disease/Disorder	tumour,224,230,Disease/Disorder	"[{""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 224, ""end_span"": 230, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"	train

Five times the whole tumour could be represented by the same slice detected by both μw and Mw values. μw and Mw values never selected the slice with maximum Es and one time selected the slice with minimum Es ( ID12 and ID4, for mean and median, respectively ). Figure 2 reports the five slices of ID12, one of the most interesting lesions, where the average BF value of the whole tumour ( μw = 125. 0) corresponds to that of the first slice ( μs = 124. 5, Figure 2 ( a ), last row ).	tumour,21,27,Disease/Disorder	tumour,380,386,Disease/Disorder	"[{""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 380, ""end_span"": 386, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"	train

No recently dead colonies of Pocillopora and only one recently dead colony of Acropora were recorded during surveys in October 2010 ( data from Guest et al. 2012) 13 therefore we can conclude that these, normally susceptible, genera were largely resistant to bleaching - associated mortality at this reef during the 2010 thermal anomaly.

A similar pattern, i. e ., relatively low susceptibility to bleaching of Acropora corals, was also reported for sites in Indonesia ( e. g ., Wakatobi) 40 and Malaysia ( e. g ., Tioman Island) 13, indicating this unusual taxonomic reversal in susceptibility was not restricted to the reef at Pulau Satumu.

The current, limited availability of samples from Singapore make it difficult to conclude definitively that symbiont clade affiliation is responsible for the high thermal tolerance of Singapore ’ s corals, however a detailed study of clade types from a wider range of coral species is currently underway.	corals,198,204,Organism/Species	coral,268,273,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""corals"", ""start_span"": 198, ""end_span"": 204, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""coral"", ""start_span"": 268, ""end_span"": 273, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	train

Due to the life history traits of Acropora and Pocillopora – i. e ., fast growth rates23, onset of sexual maturity within 2 – 3 years2425 and high rates of whole colony mortality following thermal stress18 – these taxa are the most likely to adapt in a rapidly changing environment17.

Surveys of benthic community structure carried out in 2009 and 2010 showed a reduction in overall cover of corals from ~ 73 – 51% at this site, however, there was no significant change in coral taxonomic community structure before and after the bleaching event in 2010.	corals,107,113,Organism/Species	coral,188,193,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""corals"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""coral"", ""start_span"": 188, ""end_span"": 193, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	train

Considering that there was little evidence of whole colony mortality following the 2010 bleaching ( i. e ., ~ 4% of colonies surveyed) 13, but 15 coral genera experienced partial colony mortality, it is likely that the observed loss of coral cover in 2010 was primarily due to colonies shrinking in size.	coral,146,151,Organism/Species	coral,236,241,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""coral"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""coral"", ""start_span"": 236, ""end_span"": 241, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	train
Singapore does not experience typhoons and major coral predators ( e. g ., Acanthaster planci) have not been documented locally, thus the 2010 bleaching event was the only major natural disturbance affecting Singaporean reefs during the study period.	coral,49,54,Organism/Species	Acanthaster planci,75,93,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""coral"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Acanthaster planci"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	train

As shown in Table 6, fecal excretions of nitrogen in the RP groups were significantly higher than that in the CAS group ( P < 0. 05 ), leading to the result that the apparent protein digestibility was significantly lower in RP - E and RP - A as compared with CAS ( P < 0. 05 ).

We examined the cholesterol - lowering potential of rice protein extracted by different method, suggesting that the hypocholesterolemic action of RP was associated with lower protein digestibility and higher fecal excretion of neutral sterols.	cholesterol,16,27,Chemical/Drug	sterols,235,242,Chemical/Drug	"[{""token"": ""cholesterol"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""sterols"", ""start_span"": 235, ""end_span"": 242, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"	train

The precise mechanism by which RP affects cholesterol metabolism is not fully established, but the higher extent to which RP - E and RP - A enhanced excretions of neutral sterols in fecal output should be taken into account.	cholesterol,42,53,Chemical/Drug	sterols,171,178,Chemical/Drug	"[{""token"": ""cholesterol"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""sterols"", ""start_span"": 171, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"	train
Clearly, the finding observed in this study suggests that hypocholesterolemic action induced by RP cannot be explained by the result of a simple diversion of bile acids toward fecal excretion, whereas the inhibition of intestinal cholesterol absorption, which was induced by the lower digestibility, might be one of possible mechanisms exerted by rice protein due to its lower digestibility.	bile acids,158,168,Chemical/Drug	cholesterol,230,241,Chemical/Drug	"[{""token"": ""bile acids"", ""start_span"": 158, ""end_span"": 168, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""cholesterol"", ""start_span"": 230, ""end_span"": 241, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"	train

Our data obtained from plasma HDL - C and non - HDL - C indicated that RP - E and RP - A produced the similar ratio of non - HDL - C to HDL - C in the present study ( RP - E, 0. 42; RP - A, 0. 45 ), which may result in the similar transfer of peripheral free cholesterol to the liver by a mechanism known as “ reverse cholesterol transfer ” promoted by HDL - C.	cholesterol,259,270,Chemical/Drug	cholesterol,318,329,Chemical/Drug	"[{""token"": ""cholesterol"", ""start_span"": 259, ""end_span"": 270, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""cholesterol"", ""start_span"": 318, ""end_span"": 329, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"	train
Thus, the findings observed in this study suggest that, except for the inhibition of cholesterol absorption induced by lower digestibility of RP, other mechanisms, such as the stimulation of the uptake of lipoprotein cholesterol by the liver may also come into play to fully explain the hypocholesterolemic response to RP.	cholesterol,85,96,Chemical/Drug	cholesterol,217,228,Chemical/Drug	"[{""token"": ""cholesterol"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""cholesterol"", ""start_span"": 217, ""end_span"": 228, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"	train

In light of these findings, the higher ratio of Arg / Lys in RP, which may depress the cholesterol absorption to result in hypocholesterolemia, should be also emphasized in the present study.	cholesterol,87,98,Chemical/Drug	hypocholesterolemia,123,142,Disease/Disorder	"[{""token"": ""cholesterol"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""hypocholesterolemia"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"	train
However, it does not seem very likely that the other remaining non - protein components, e. g ., dietary fiber, carbohydrate, in RP may contribute to the cholesterol - lowering effects in this study because their concentrations are extremely low compared to the concentrations normally used for the induction of hypolipidemia.	carbohydrate,112,124,Chemical/Drug	cholesterol,154,165,Chemical/Drug	"[{""token"": ""carbohydrate"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""cholesterol"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 165, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"	train

Overall, because of its influence on patients ' psychological well - being, social adjustment to their IBD and health care utilization, integrating HRQOL into the routine clinical assessment of patients with IBD, and targeting it as a treatment aim is strongly recommended.

This is surprising given that farming practices can induce increased parasite virulence, for example ( i) by selecting for short host lifespan which in turn prompts for accelerated parasite life history ( as in the case of Marek ’ s disease in farmed chicken [ 16 ]); ( ii) high host densities which facilitate transmission ( e. g. [ 17 ]); ( iii) through vaccination and treatment protocols which reduce the disease symptoms rather than eliminate pathogens [ 18 ], thereby relaxing competition between parasites and favouring outbreaks of more virulent opportunistic strains [ 17 ]; or ( iv) through inbreeding depression of stocks which favours the emergence of specialised pathogen strains ( see review by [ 18 ]).

Although this study did not identify any pre - existing patient characteristics that might predict a treatment - response, tadalafil 5mg once daily has been shown to effectively impact LUTS - BPH across a range of patient subgroups.	tadalafil,123,132,Chemical/Drug	BPH,192,195,Disease/Disorder	"[{""token"": ""tadalafil"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""BPH"", ""start_span"": 192, ""end_span"": 195, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"	train
Therefore, the decision to treat an individual case of LUTS - BPH with tadalafil 5mg once daily continues to rest on medical assessment of the patient, consideration of contra - indications, presence of co - existing conditions, with the patient ’ s expectations and preferences leading to mutual patient - physician agreement.

The relative constant incidence of CKD with increasing disease duration could be due to a number of confounding factors, such as the influence of genetic predisposition to develop renal complication as well as a selection bias due to premature death in those prone to develop renal disease.

Therefore, further investigation of different endophenotypes of hyperhidrosis should include genetic analyses, too.

Although these studies provided a new avenue to understanding soft - part preservation, all previous studies described possible cuticle preservation only based on micro - structural comparisons with the cuticle of extant avian eggshells.

The protoporphyrin is deposited predominantly in the cuticle layer ( Schwartz et al ., 1975; Nys et al ., 1991; Mikšík et al ., 2007; Nys & Guyot, 2011 ), thus providing indirect evidence of cuticle preservation in the preservation of endogenous protoporphyrin ( Wiemann et al ., 2017 ).	protoporphyrin,4,18,Chemical/Drug	protoporphyrin,246,260,Chemical/Drug	"[{""token"": ""protoporphyrin"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""protoporphyrin"", ""start_span"": 246, ""end_span"": 260, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"	train

SEM images show that the vessels in the chorioallantoic membrane of modern chicken eggshells range in size from 3 to 10 µm ( Maiber et al ., 2016 ), similar to the fiber - like structure we observed in the Triprismatoolithus eggshell ( Fig. 4D ).	chicken,75,82,Organism/Species	Triprismatoolithus,206,224,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""chicken"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Triprismatoolithus"", ""start_span"": 206, ""end_span"": 224, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	train
The membrana testacea fibers in a chicken egg occasionally penetrate through the mammillary base ( Ahmed, Suso & Hincke, 2017) and are of the same size of around 3 µm as the fiber - like structure we observed in the Triprismatoolithus egg ( Fig. 4D ).	chicken,34,41,Organism/Species	Triprismatoolithus,216,234,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""chicken"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Triprismatoolithus"", ""start_span"": 216, ""end_span"": 234, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	train

Therefore, the difference in P distribution between young and older birds can probably help paleontologists decipher whether an oviraptorid clutch was laid by a single female or by several females.	birds,68,73,Organism/Species	oviraptorid,128,139,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""birds"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""oviraptorid"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	train
Conversely, different patterns of increase would suggest that females of different ages contributed to a single clutch. Varricchio et al.

β1 is a multifunctional molecule that plays a critical role during CNS development. 5 Although β1 is essential for regulating excitability through fine - tuning VGSC gating and kinetics, 16 its function as a CAM is required for neurite outgrowth, migration, fasciculation and synaptic connectivity. 15 – 17 In fact, β1 may function as a CAM, independent of channel activity under certain conditions. 5 Other CAMs that regulate neuronal migration and pathfinding have been reported in tumours, where they play a pathological role and associate with poor prognosis. 45 It is therefore not unreasonable to expect that β1 may do the same.

We showed previously that β1 enhances cell - cell adhesion and cell - substrate adhesion in BCa cells in vitro. 24 In the present study, we found that β1 over - expression in MDA - MB - 231 cells caused a more elongate cellular morphology within tumours, and enhanced process outgrowth in vitro via trans - homophilic adhesion. β1 - mediated process outgrowth did not occur in control MDA - MB - 231 cells, which express a low level of endogenous β1.

The shortage of information on specific food items consumed by a number of these parrot species prevented us from being able to investigate the secondary metabolites that could be present in their diets ( Additional file 1: Table S1 ), as we did for the parrot species sampled in this study ( Additional file 3: Table S2 ).	parrot,81,87,Organism/Species	parrot,254,260,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""parrot"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""parrot"", ""start_span"": 254, ""end_span"": 260, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	train
Then, we transformed the infection information of the combined dataset into presence / absence data for each individual investigated ( see combined dataset provided in Additional file 4 ), as 37% of previously published data on hemoparasites in wild parrots lacked information on prevalence.	infection,25,34,Disease/Disorder	parrots,250,257,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""infection"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""parrots"", ""start_span"": 250, ""end_span"": 257, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	train

None of the species found infected ( red - fronted parakeets, austral parakeets) consumed any food item with antimalarial or general antiparasitic properties ( Table 1, and Additional file 3: Table S2 ).	red - fronted parakeets,37,60,Organism/Species	austral parakeets,62,79,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""red - fronted parakeets"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""austral parakeets"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	train

Thus, our results add further evidence in favour of prophylactic anti - parasite self - medication as a wider than previously thought behaviour in both vertebrates and invertebrates, and increase our understanding of why certain food items are taken regardless being poisonous or with little nutritional value [ 61 – 63, 97 – 99 ].	vertebrates,152,163,Organism/Species	invertebrates,168,181,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""vertebrates"", ""start_span"": 152, ""end_span"": 163, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""invertebrates"", ""start_span"": 168, ""end_span"": 181, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	train

Alternatively, infection by blood parasites in these species could be lethal, making the discovery of infected birds unlikely.	infection,15,24,Disease/Disorder	birds,111,116,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""infection"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""birds"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	train
The second interesting pattern that we observed is that the two infected parrot species ( red - fronted and austral parakeets) regularly consume omnivorous diets.	parrot,73,79,Organism/Species	austral parakeets,108,125,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""parrot"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""austral parakeets"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	train
However, our review of previous studies on parrots did not show a full association between the diet consumed and the presence of hemoparasites: 70% of omnivorous wild parrots were reported to be infected, while only 12% of herbivorous were also reported as infected ( Additional file 1: Table S1 ).	parrots,43,50,Organism/Species	parrots,167,174,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""parrots"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""parrots"", ""start_span"": 167, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	train
Lastly, an omnivorous diet could reduce the amount of plant material consumed by a given animal, reducing the intake of secondary metabolites with antiparasitic, antimicrobial, antiinflammatory, anticarcinogenic, analgesic, expectorant or antipyretic activities, and thus have a negative impact on health.	plant,54,59,Organism/Species	animal,89,95,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""plant"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""animal"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	train
Individuals from the two species infected in our samples, the red - fronted parakeet and the austral parakeet belonged to wild populations that inhabit forests ( Table 1 ).	red - fronted parakeet,62,84,Organism/Species	austral parakeet,93,109,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""red - fronted parakeet"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""austral parakeet"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	train
In contrast, potential dipteran vectors abound in the sector of northern Patagonia, where the austral parakeet population was investigated, and in the islands of New Zealand, where the red - fronted parakeet was investigated [ 138, 139 ].	austral parakeet,94,110,Organism/Species	red - fronted parakeet,185,207,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""austral parakeet"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""red - fronted parakeet"", ""start_span"": 185, ""end_span"": 207, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	train

Second, validating this hypothesis would allow to validate at the same time a number of other hypotheses also generated using rule ( R5 ), that relate to modulations of the phosphorylation of MEK by molecules upstream of phospho - p38MAPK.

However, the observed differences could also be due to technical reasons, such as differences in quality or affinity of the antibodies used to detect the phosphorylated forms of MEK and ERK, or differences in the total amounts of both proteins present in the cells.

That the effect was seen in these four clinics, but not the others, is probably explained by the availability of syphilis test kits and drugs: in many clinics these were not available outside of the survey period and therefore women were unlikely to have been tested for syphilis before surveillance started.	syphilis,113,121,Disease/Disorder	syphilis,271,279,Disease/Disorder	"[{""token"": ""syphilis"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""syphilis"", ""start_span"": 271, ""end_span"": 279, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"	train

Based on a cut - off BPDAI value of 56 ( see Materials and Methods ), the percentage of BP patients with a severe disease was significantly lower in BP patients without mucosal involvement ( 20. 8 %) as compared to those with mucosal involvement ( 44. 4 %) ( Table 1; P = 0. 04 ).

This unconventional result could imply that the immune response may be shifted toward other autoantibodies in those BP patients with mucosal involvement which could be related to a lower threshold of tolerance breakdown in line with a reduced level of Treg cells or of Treg homing as mentioned above.	autoantibodies,92,106,Gene/Protein	BP,116,118,Disease/Disorder	"[{""token"": ""autoantibodies"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""BP"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"	train
Based on a recent publication ( 20 ), we can hypothesize that the loss of immune tolerance curbs both the innate and the adaptive immune responses, which leads to the release of a specific panel of proteases associated with blister formation and tissue remodeling, and subsequently to a shift of the epitope targeted as compared with the classical pathophysiological mechanisms associated with BP.	proteases,198,207,Gene/Protein	BP,394,396,Disease/Disorder	"[{""token"": ""proteases"", ""start_span"": 198, ""end_span"": 207, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""BP"", ""start_span"": 394, ""end_span"": 396, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"	train

As shown in Fig. 3C and 3D, all tRNA modification mutants, including the elp3uba4 mutant, where Pfk1 and Cdc19 signals are severely reduced, formed comparable numbers of viable cells in individual spots, indicating a similar input to chemical lysis.

Since tRNA modification defects might impair decoding of transcripts in a codon dependent manner, we next checked whether the observed effects on Pfk1 and Cdc19 are disproportionately high compared to the effect on global protein content.

Rather than checking protein content per cell, we analyzed Cdc19 and Pfk1 abundances in protein preparations from the tRNA modification mutants after normalization to equal protein concentrations.

Strikingly, no differences in total protein content of such samples are detected after Coomassie staining ( Fig. 3B) but also the observed differences of Pfk1 and Cdc19 abundance in the different tRNA modification mutants entirely leveled out ( Fig. 3E ).

These results indicate that the negative impact of the various tRNA modification defects on Pfk1 and Cdc19 abundance is comparable to the proteome average and therefore is unlikely to be linked to a particular codon pattern of the respective genes and the translatability of their mRNAs.

In both, mcm5 / ncm5 or s2 - deficient backgrounds ( elp3 or ncs6 single mutants ), the TS phenotypes can be complemented in part by excess of tRNALys UUU and tRNAGln UUG [ 24 ], which suggested that the mcm5 and s2 modifications individually contribute to the decoding efficiency of these tRNAs.	elp3,53,57,Gene/Protein	ncs6,61,65,Gene/Protein	"[{""token"": ""elp3"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""ncs6"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"	train
Since the combination of elp3 and ncs6 mutations was lethal in the previously studied strain background and this synthetic interaction could also be suppressed by excess of tRNALys UUU, it was concluded that the simultaneous absence of mcm5U and s2U from tRNALys UUU results in a decoding defect so severe that it accounts for the observed inviability [ 17 ].	elp3,25,29,Gene/Protein	ncs6,34,38,Gene/Protein	"[{""token"": ""elp3"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""ncs6"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"	train

The elp3urm1 strain carrying ELP3 on a centromeric URA3 plasmid was transformed with empty vector ( pRS425) or vectors overexpressing tRNALys UUU alone ( pK) or together with tRNAGln UUG and tRNAGlu UUC ( pQKE) and subsequently streaked in parallel on – URA and FOA media.

However, both plasmids also detectably increased Pfk1 levels in the wild type background ( Fig. 4D ), suggesting that cellular pools of tRNAGln UUG, tRNAGlu UUC and tRNALys UUU may be a limiting factor for expression of the highly abundant Pfk1 protein.

We checked the effects of mcm5s2U removal on total cellular protein levels in S. cerevisiae and observed a severe depletion of cellular protein content that was also exemplified for Cdc19 and Pfk1, usually two highly abundant proteins.

However, since SILAC experiments also revealed a clear induction of proteins involved in proteasomal degradation and protein folding / stability in elp3 / urm1 single mutants [ 27 ], increased protein degradation or decreased protein stability may also contribute to overall lowered protein detection in mcm5s2U lacking strains.	elp3,148,152,Gene/Protein	urm1,155,159,Gene/Protein	"[{""token"": ""elp3"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""urm1"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 159, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"	train
Consistent with the interpretation that loss of wobble uridine modifications can cause protein stress, it was shown previously that trm9 mutants lacking the methytransferase involved in mcm5 side chain formation activate certain heat shock proteins and markers of the unfolded protein response [ 38 ].	uridine,55,62,Chemical/Drug	trm9,132,136,Gene/Protein	"[{""token"": ""uridine"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""trm9"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"	train
In support of the latter option, individual loss of mcm5 or s2 wobble uridine modifications was shown to activate the general aminoacid control pathway, a consequence of which is the inhibition of global translation, and interfere with TOR pathway signaling [ 28, 41 ].	uridine,70,77,Chemical/Drug	aminoacid,126,135,Chemical/Drug	"[{""token"": ""uridine"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""aminoacid"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"	train

Recent evidence suggests that the genes most commonly translocated with MLL are not selected at random but may in fact be functionally related as part of an ' MLL - web ' [ 5, 23, 24 ].

If this is true, then in the context of the observed relationship between MLL expression and GC resistance in the present study ( Figure 1A) one might predict that the expression of these genes would similarly be correlated with GC resistance in our T - ALL cell lines.

Despite the absence of MLL - translocations in the T - ALL cell lines we observed that a large number of these ( 18 genes, 26 probe sets) were significantly correlated to MPRED and DEX resistance ( Table 3 ).

To conclude: probing the meaning of emotion regulation, measured on subjective and cortical level, in FNSD in the context of time / treatment offers first clues that need to be substantiated in powered, targeted studies: changes in the subjectively experienced symptom severity and psychological strain may vary with a tendency to adjust everyday emotion regulation toward accentuated use of cognitive strategies, and to reduce alexithymia.

Long - term survival of parasitic helminths in the host is an impressive feat in the face of the well - armed immune response, which mobilises multiple cell types and molecular mediators, including high - affinity antibodies, to attack invading organisms.

Using spectrophotometry ( Hayes et al ., 2015) and two - photon fluorescence microscopy ( Gore et al ., 2014 ), we have found that stromal riboflavin absorption in epithelium - intact corneas can be improved by increasing riboflavin concentration, epithelial contact time and iontophoresis dosage.	riboflavin,139,149,Chemical/Drug	riboflavin,222,232,Chemical/Drug	"[{""token"": ""riboflavin"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""riboflavin"", ""start_span"": 222, ""end_span"": 232, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"	train

In addition to using this formulation, the modified protocol employed a riboflavin - epithelial contact period of 5 min after iontophoresis to allow time for the sub - epithelial iontophoretically delivered riboflavin to diffuse homogeneously into the stroma, as well as an increased dosage of iontophoresis with a second treatment 5 min after the first.	riboflavin,72,82,Chemical/Drug	riboflavin,207,217,Chemical/Drug	"[{""token"": ""riboflavin"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""riboflavin"", ""start_span"": 207, ""end_span"": 217, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"	train

People with autistic - spectrum disorder ( ASD) experience difficulties in comprehension of figurative language, and tend to give literal interpretation to ambiguous syntactic expressions, to phrases that convey irony, humor, or sarcasm, to idioms, or to metaphors ( Happé, 1993, 1995; Kerbel and Grunwell, 1998; Rapin and Dunn, 2003; Adachi et al ., 2004; Rundblad and Annaz, 2010; Mashal and Kasirer, 2011 ).	autistic - spectrum disorder,12,40,Disease/Disorder	ASD,43,46,Disease/Disorder	"[{""token"": ""autistic - spectrum disorder"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""ASD"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"	train

The ability to combine the two words that form a metaphor to a meaningful expression might thus be more affected by deficits in executive functions than the ability to interpret literal expressions ( Amanzio et al ., 2008 ).

Examples of creative sentence completions included phrases such as “ Feeling successful is like seeing the view from the mountaintop ” and “ Feeling worthless is like offering a salad to South Americans .” These examples contrasted with more conventional figurative expressions provided by TD adults, such as “ Feeling sad is to get the blues .” Our results suggest that adults with ASD can create unique verbal associations that are not restricted to previous knowledge, thus pointing to unique verbal creativity in ASD.

Expression in the MeWo cells, although at rather low levels ( average Cp value 34. 7 compared to the controls ( miR - 16 and 103) at 25. 9 and 27. 8 respectively ), indicates possible involvement in regulating the endogenous levels of MITF in this cell type.

This may indicate that the NH physicians have prescribed the anti - dementia drugs without having a dementia diagnosis ( P70 ), but the physicians may have used the diagnosis cognitive problems ( P20) as an indication for prescribing the drug.	dementia,68,76,Disease/Disorder	dementia,100,108,Disease/Disorder	"[{""token"": ""dementia"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""dementia"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"	train
However, in a recent Norwegian study it was found that a substantial number of persons who purchased anti - dementia drugs had no diagnosis of dementia or cognitive problems registered in the primary health care service system [ 87 ].	dementia,108,116,Disease/Disorder	dementia,143,151,Disease/Disorder	"[{""token"": ""dementia"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""dementia"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"	train
However, CDR is an accepted assessment tool and is commonly used in epidemiological NH studies to identify dementia and measure the severity of dementia [ 65, 88 ], and the agreement between CDR and a diagnostic assessment according to the ICD - 10 is high [ 62 ].	dementia,107,115,Disease/Disorder	dementia,144,152,Disease/Disorder	"[{""token"": ""dementia"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""dementia"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"	train
Modern three ‐ dimensional radiotherapy treatment planning of cancer demands we use volumetric image data sets to design the conformal therapy of tumors, and conformal avoidance of the proximal, dose limiting, organs at risk. ( 1) Most commonly, X ray computed tomography ( CT) is used to provide this three ‐ dimensional model of the patient; furthermore, the Hounsfield / CT number information it provides can be calibrated to give an electron density map of the patient, which is used to make corrections in dose calculations.	cancer,62,68,Disease/Disorder	tumors,146,152,Disease/Disorder	"[{""token"": ""cancer"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""tumors"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"	train
