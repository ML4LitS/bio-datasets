Recently, we have shown that anemic patients with P. vivax infection had elevated levels of anti - RBCs antibodies, which could enhance in vitro phagocytosis of nRBCs and decrease their deformability.

Several reasons have been suggested to explain the removal of nRBC8, including impaired RBC production through dyserythropoiesis or bone marrow insufficiency9, exposition of erythrocytes to oxidative stress triggered by parasite rupture or host immune responses10, 11, and mechanical ex vivo destruction of non - infected red blood cells ( nRBCs ), as it has been demonstrated using a splenic sinusoid model12, in addition to other mechanisms that may also be relevant to P. vivax - associated anemia.

In contrast to the myeloid lineage, lymphocytes are not significantly affected by Thoc1 loss under the conditions tested.	"Thoc1	82	87	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Thoc1"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
While this increase in B cells highlights the different effects of Thoc1 deficiency on myeloid and lymphoid lineages, the cause is unclear.	"Thoc1	67	72	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Thoc1"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Increased R - loop formation in Thoc1 deficient B - cells may increase class - switch recombination and the generation of plasma cells migrating to the peripheral blood.	"Thoc1	32	37	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Thoc1"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
As expected based on the differential effects on the myeloid and lymphoid lineages, the number of HSC and MPP cells which precede myeloid / lymphoid commitment are also largely unaffected by Thoc1 loss.	"Thoc1	191	196	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Thoc1"", ""start_span"": 191, ""end_span"": 196, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
While lymphocytes are minimally affected, it is tempting to speculate that Thoc1 loss may have non - cell autonomous effects on adaptive immunity.	"Thoc1	75	80	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Thoc1"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Adaptive immunity during an antigenic challenge may be compromised indirectly by adverse effects of Thoc1 deficiency on myeloid - derived dendritic cells.	"Thoc1	100	105	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Thoc1"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
It is also possible that Thoc1 loss would affect lymphocytes if examined over longer periods of time.	"Thoc1	25	30	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Thoc1"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Deleting Thoc5 has deleterious effects on the gut and myeloid lineages of the hematopoietic system.	"Thoc5	9	14	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Thoc5"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In contrast to our observations, deleting Thoc5 reduces red blood cell and platelet counts in the peripheral blood.	"Thoc5	42	47	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Thoc5"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
This suggests that THO complex subunits become unstable when the complex does not assemble normally [ 34 ].	"THO	19	22	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""THO"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Lineage dependent effects of THO complex deficiency have now been observed in multiple biological contexts [ 25 ], [ 27 ], [ 35 ], [ 36 ].	"THO	29	32	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""THO"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
One possible explanation is that the THO complex regulates a subset of transcripts important for the cell types affected.	"THO	37	40	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""THO"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Consistent with this hypothesis, Thoc5 deficient myeloid cells show defects in the expression of some genes that potentially influence myeloid differentiation [ 32 ].	"Thoc5	33	38	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Thoc5"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
How THO selects transcripts for regulation is unknown, but elucidation of these mechanisms will be required to validate this hypothesis.	"THO	4	7	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""THO"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Alternatively, THO may regulate a large number of gene transcripts in most cells.	"THO	15	18	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""THO"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
If this extends to mammalian cells, Thoc1 deficiency would be expected to cause a general decline in the efficiency of gene expression.	"Thoc1	36	41	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Thoc1"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In this case, differential effects of THO deficiency on individual transcripts is expected to be modest, as is typically observed [ 21 ], [ 32 ], [ 35 ], [ 37 ], [ 38 ], and highly expressed genes would likely show the greatest defects [ 20 ].	"THO	38	41	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""THO"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Widespread defects in gene transcription may also account for the accumulation of R - loops and DNA damage that is observed in THO deficient cells [ 31 ].	"THO	127	130	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""THO"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In this scenario, cell types that turn over rapidly would be expected to suffer the most from Thoc1 loss.	"Thoc1	94	99	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Thoc1"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Indeed one characteristic shared by the cell types acutely sensitive to Thoc1 loss is their relatively rapid turnover.	"Thoc1	72	77	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Thoc1"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
This alternative hypothesis predicts that Thoc1 loss would also affect lymphocytes if examined under conditions like adaptive immunity where transcriptional programs drive robust lymphocyte proliferation and production of effector molecules.	"Thoc1	42	47	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Thoc1"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The role that RNP complexes play in supporting coordinated gene expression programs is increasingly appreciated [ 3 ], [ 4 ], but the requirements for individual complexes in normal development and homeostasis have not been explored extensively.

Elucidation of the mechanisms underlying these context dependent effects will inform our understanding of how RNP complexes contribute to normal development, tissue homeostasis, and disease.

MicroRNAs ( miRNAs) comprise a recently discovered class of small, non - coding RNA molecules of 21 – 25 nucleotides in length that regulate the gene expression by base - pairing with the transcripts of their targets i. e. protein - coding genes, leading to down - regulation or repression of the target genes [ 1 ].

Our putative findings suggest that these 8 miRNAs could mediate the down - regulation of the crucial checkpoint genes ( inhibitors) of the cell cycle, and proliferation and may result in the aberrant activation of these processes which may lead to PKD.

For example, the estimated age - adjusted incidence of ICC in the United States increased by 165% from 1979 to 1999 ( from 0. 32 per 100, 000 in 1975 to 1979 to 0. 85 per 100, 000 in 1995 to 1999 ), with a majority of the increase observed after 1985 [ 6 ].

More recently, Nathan et al. evaluated 598 patients who underwent surgery for ICC between 1988 and 2004 from the SEER database and proposed a new simplified staging system from independent predictors of survival that eventually was largely adopted in the 7th edition of the AJCC / UICC staging manual [ 50 ].

Since the first International Congress on Research in Burns over 50 years ago, progress has been made in a host of areas, and vital improvements in early resuscitation, infection management, wound excision and coverage, and fluid management have helped in the fight against burn mortality [ 6, 7 ].	"infection	169	178	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""infection"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In addition to local injury at the site of burn, severe thermal injury over a large area of the skin, roughly 20% total body surface area ( TBSA) or greater, results in acute systemic responses collectively known as burn shock [ 11 ].	"burn shock	216	226	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""burn shock"", ""start_span"": 216, ""end_span"": 226, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Burn shock is characterized by increased capillary permeability, increased hydrostatic pressure across the microvasculature, protein and fluid movement from the intravascular space into the interstitial space, increased systemic vascular resistance, reduced cardiac output, and hypovolemia requiring fluid resuscitation [ 12 ].	"Burn shock	0	10	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Burn shock"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The extent of inflammation and hypermetabolism is related to the extent [ 19] and depth of burn, as deeper burns show higher levels of circulating cytokines [ 20] and a greater hypermetabolic response [ 21 ].	"cytokines	147	156	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cytokines"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The initial inflammatory phase brings neutrophils and monocytes to the site of injury via localized vasodilation and fluid extravasation, thereby initiating an immune response that is later sustained by the recruitment of macrophages by chemokines [ 31 ].	"chemokines	237	247	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""chemokines"", ""start_span"": 237, ""end_span"": 247, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The inflammatory phase serves not only to prevent infection during healing, but also to degrade necrotic tissue and activate signals required for wound repair [ 33 ].	"infection	50	59	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""infection"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Following, and overlapping with the inflammatory response, the proliferative phase is characterized by keratinocyte and fibroblast activation by cytokines and growth factors [ 34 ].	"cytokines	145	154	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cytokines"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Wound re - epithelialization, or closure, in the proliferative phase via keratinocyte and fibroblast activation, or migration from dedifferentiated hair follicles and other epidermal analogs [ 41, 42 ], is mediated by cytokines recruited in the inflammatory phase.	"cytokines	218	227	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cytokines"", ""start_span"": 218, ""end_span"": 227, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Interestingly, studies suggest that in the absence of infection, inflammation might not be required for tissue repair [ 46 ].	"infection	54	63	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""infection"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Traditional anti - inflammatory treatments that focus on the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, such as nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs or glucocorticoids, impair wound healing [ 47 ].	"prostaglandin	75	88	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""prostaglandin"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Early excision and grafting has become the gold standard for treatment of full and deep partial thickness burns [ 50, 51 ], in part because early excision helps reduce the risk of infection and scarring [ 52 – 54 ].	"infection	180	189	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""infection"", ""start_span"": 180, ""end_span"": 189, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
While the majority of animal studies have demonstrated consistent anti - inflammatory effects of opioids on peripheral neurons [ 55 ], clinical studies have shown little to no effect on inflammation [ 56 ].

Owing to high lethality, suspicion of an invasive burn wound infection mandates rapid diagnosis, often by histopathology, and excision or re - excision of the wound.

For example, early excision and aggressive feeding in children does not diminish energy expenditure but is associated with decreased muscle protein catabolism, a decreased rate of burn sepsis, and significantly lower bacterial counts from excised tissue [ 85 ].

Most studies have shown that excision within 24 to 48 h after injury is associated with decreased blood loss, infection, length of hospital stay and mortality, and increased graft take [ 105 – 108 ], although mortality reductions may only occur in patients without inhalation injury [ 109 ].

The Chr16s / s congenics containing the SWR haplotype between D16Mit125 to D16Mit30 showed significantly higher liver non - heme iron content compared with Chr16b / b controls, indicating that the previously detected QTL fell in this region ( Figure 1B ).

To fine - map the QTL on Chr16, we continuously backcrossed the initial Chr16 congenic line 1 with B6 mice to generate subcongenic lines carrying various SWR chromosome segments between D16Mit125 and D16Mit185 ( Figure 2A ).

The qPCR results showed a 1. 7 - fold upregulation in the expression of the iron - related gene, Hmox1, in Chr16s / s congenic livers compared with Chr16b / b control livers, which was consistent with the hepatic iron accumulation ( Figure 3B ).	"Hmox1	97	102	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Hmox1"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

To test whether the expression variations of these candidates contributes to the QTL, we examined the expression profile of all 11 candidates in congenic mouse livers using qPCR.

Furthermore, sequence analysis and biochemical experiments suggest that Sidt1 proteins are composed of an N - terminal extracellular domain followed by 9 – 12 predicted transmembrane regions, and that the extracellular domain controls its intrinsic ability to transport dsRNA [ 35 ].	"Sidt1	72	77	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sidt1"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
We speculated that this variation may affect protein function and thus selected Sidt1 as a strong candidate for this study.	"Sidt1	80	85	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sidt1"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
However, after successful overexpression of the two proteins in mouse liver ( Figure 5C ), no significant changes in liver iron were found compared with empty vector controls ( Figure 5D ).

However, overexpression of mSidt1 ( both B6 allele and SWR allele) did not increase the uptake of NTBI ( Figure 5F) at different pH values.	"mSidt1	27	33	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""mSidt1"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

Thus, we conclude that mSidt1 does not directly mediate iron uptake into cells.	"mSidt1	23	29	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""mSidt1"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In fact, many putative QTLs have been identified by classic intercrosses of different mouse strains with varied iron statuses [ 12 ], [ 13 ], [ 14 ].	"mouse	86	91	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
However, it is believed that the true number of QTLs is smaller than reported [ 37] as few have been validated or fine - mapped through use of congenic mouse models.	"mouse	152	157	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 152, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In our study, we provided evidence to verify the QTL previously identified on Chr16, which is responsible for the difference in basal hepatic iron levels between B6 and SWR mice.

It is possible that candidate genes may function in organs other than liver to influence liver iron status, considering that both the serum iron and transferrin saturation are high in Chr16s / s congenics.

However, it is possible that Sidt1 could uptake some other solutes and in turn, affect iron homeostasis.	"Sidt1	29	34	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sidt1"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
However, Boc gene expression in the liver is low and its only reported function is during neural development [ 26 ], [ 42 ].	"Boc	9	12	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Boc"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

Nonetheless, the possibility remains that there are variations in Atp6v1a protein levels, including protein content and subcellular localization, in our models.	"Atp6v1a	66	73	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Atp6v1a"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

However, there is now evidence including observations from our previous study25 that demonstrates initiation of protein translation can occur at most codons which differ from AUG by no more than a single nucleotide ( non - AUG initiation) 20.

From a demand perspective, compared to large hospitals, patients were not attracted by a narrower ‘ menu ’ of HIV services, weaker patient follow - up capacity, longer waiting times due to fewer staff, more frequent drug stock - outs and unreliable electricity supply.

If a parasite is able to transmit horizontally or vertically, which transmission mode will it choose?	"parasite	5	13	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parasite"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In poor conditions the parasites were more likely to be transmitted horizontally, whereas in favourable conditions they were more likely to be transmitted vertically.	"parasites	23	32	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parasites"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This led to a trade - off among the host ’ s families ( which can be interpreted as a genetic correlation) for the parasite ’ s transmission mode.	"parasite	115	123	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parasite"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Since horizontal transmission is linked to higher virulence than vertical transmission, the host ’ s contribution to transmission mode has important consequences for the evolution of parasites with mixed - mode transmission.	"parasites	183	192	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parasites"", ""start_span"": 183, ""end_span"": 192, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In contrast vertical transmission is expected to be associated with low virulence, for the parasite and the host share to a large degree their evolutionary interests [ 4 ].	"parasite	91	99	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parasite"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In many parasites with such mixed - mode transmission, the two transmission modes are physiologically, developmentally or evolutionarily linked [ 9 – 12 ].	"parasites	8	17	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parasites"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
When a trade - off between the two transmission modes is present, it strongly influences the parasite ’ s evolution and dynamics [ 7, 16 ].	"parasite	93	101	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parasite"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This implies that the trade - off between the two transmission modes is an important part of a parasite ’ s epidemiology [ 17 ].	"parasite	95	103	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parasite"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Although several studies have measured the trade - off between horizontal and vertical transmission, almost all of them have focused on the variation due to the environment rather than to the host ’ s or parasite ’ s genotypes.	"parasite	204	212	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parasite"", ""start_span"": 204, ""end_span"": 212, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The bacterium has a reproductive stage that is used to infect the daughter nuclei of infected cells, and it has an infectious stage that can be transmitted horizontally.	"bacterium	4	13	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bacterium"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The parasite has two forms of spores: binucleate spores that infect the eggs of infected females and are transmitted vertically, and uninucleate spores that can kill infected larvae and are transmitted horizontally among larvae.	"parasite	4	12	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parasite"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Such an adaptive explanation requires that the transmission mode is ultimately controlled by the parasite ’ s genes.	"parasite	97	105	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parasite"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
While there are thus a few suggestions of the parasite ’ s genes control of its transmission mode, we may expect that the transmission mode and the trade - off between horizontal and vertical transmission are also influenced by the host ’ s genes.	"parasite	46	54	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parasite"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Thus, selection for delayed pupation of the mosquito brings with it more vertical and less horizontal transmission of E. aedis.	"mosquito	44	52	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mosquito"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

Such a host - parasite interaction may consequently shape spatial gradients of local adaptation in accordance with the idea of the geographic mosaic of co - evolution [ 28, 29 ].

We further expected that the mosquito ’ s genotypes enabling large size and long life would favour vertical transmission, while genotypes with a long development would favour horizontal transmission, and that these associations would be more apparent when food is scarce.

These vertically infected mosquitoes die as juveniles and release the uninucleate spores into the water.	"mosquitoes	26	36	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mosquitoes"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Note that underlying this sequence of transmission is a fixed developmental sequence ( though not necessarily fixed timing) of the parasite that alternates the production of binucleate and uninucleate spores [ 36, 38 ].	"parasite	131	139	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parasite"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Usually ( solid line ), the parasite alternate vertical and horizontal transmission using two types of spores.	"parasite	28	36	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parasite"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We approximated genetic variation with the variation among full - sib families, where we minimized the maternal effects by rearing the mosquitoes of the parental generation individually in identical environments.	"mosquitoes	135	145	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mosquitoes"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
They were fed daily with TetraMin ™ fish food ( age 0 ( day of hatching, day 0 ): 0. 06 mg / larva, age 1: 0. 08 mg, age 2: 0. 16 mg, age 3: 0. 32 mg, age 4: 0. 64 mg, from age 5 onwards: 0. 32 mg ).	"fish	36	40	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""fish"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
During this period, adults were also provided with a cotton ball soaked with 10% sugar solution, which was changed every 2 days.	"sugar	81	86	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sugar"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Each family experienced two larval food treatments ( 50% or 100% of our standardized ration of TetraMin Baby ™ fish food ( see above )).	"fish	111	115	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""fish"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The spores had been harvested from vertically infected larvae hatched 7 days earlier than the day of infection.	"infection	101	110	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""infection"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Pupae were individually transferred to Falcon tubes, and the emerging adults were provided with a cotton ball soaked with 10% sugar solution that was changed every 6 days.	"sugar	126	131	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sugar"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We considered that mosquitoes enabled horizontal transmission, if they died before emerging and harbored uninucleate spores, and that they did not enable horizontal transmission either if they carried no uninucleate spores or did not die as juveniles.	"mosquitoes	19	29	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mosquitoes"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We considered that mosquitoes enabled vertical transmission, if adult females carried binucleate spores, and that they did not enable vertical transmission otherwise.	"mosquitoes	19	29	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mosquitoes"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Second, most of the mosquitoes do not carry any spores ( in particular uninucleate spores ), so that any quantitative measure would strongly resemble the qualitative one.	"mosquitoes	20	30	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mosquitoes"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The potential for horizontal transmission ( the proportion of mosquitoes that died before emergence and harboured uninucleate spores) at high and low food was thus 0. 2% and 5% of the exposed individuals ( χ2 = 54. 1, df = 1, p < 0. 001) ( Fig. 2 ).	"mosquitoes	62	72	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mosquitoes"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Among the mosquitoes that emerged as adult females, 91% and 95% harboured binucleate spores at high and low food, and respectively 42% and 7% of the these females enabled vertical transmission ( χ2 = 350, df = 1, p < 0. 001) ( Fig. 2 ). Fig. 2Proportion of potential for vertical and horizontal transmission for low and high food conditions.	"mosquitoes	10	20	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mosquitoes"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The mean potential within families for the parasite to be transmitted vertically was negatively correlated with the average potential of horizontal transmission ( F = 23. 1, df = 1, r2 = 0. 49, p < 0. 001) ( Fig. 5 ).	"parasite	43	51	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parasite"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Although food treatment had no significant effect on the trade - off between vertical and horizontal transmission ( F = 1. 19, p = 0. 285 ), this result is difficult to interpret because of the limited horizontal transmission at the high food level. Fig. 5Potential for vertical transmission as a function of the potential for horizontal transmission in Edhazardia aedis at low food ( closed symbols) and high food ( open symbols ).	"Edhazardia aedis	354	370	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Edhazardia aedis"", ""start_span"": 354, ""end_span"": 370, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
They also highlight the role of the host ’ s genotype in linking its life - history to the parasite ’ s transmission and in influencing the trade - offs underlying transmission mode.	"parasite	91	99	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parasite"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Corroborating earlier studies [ 19, 20 ], the parasite shows an adaptive response to changes of the host ’ s development.	"parasite	46	54	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parasite"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
However, poor food conditions also delay pupation, giving the parasite more time to complete its development from binucleate to uninucleate spores within a single larva.	"parasite	62	70	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parasite"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This enables the parasite to achieve a high load of horizontally transmitted spores, and thus to kill its host [ 20] and being transmitted efficiently.	"parasite	17	25	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parasite"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
If growth is fast, in contrast, the parasite can expect that its host will lay many eggs; it therefore puts more emphasis on vertical transmission.	"parasite	36	44	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parasite"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Note that our use of the phrase ‘ adaptive response ’ refers to ( non - genetic) changes of the parasite ’ s transmission mode.	"parasite	96	104	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parasite"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This does not imply that the parasite alters its development.	"parasite	29	37	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parasite"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
An interesting implication of this idea is that the parasite has evolved its fixed developmental pattern in a way that optimises its transmission in its very variable environment ( that is, host ).	"parasite	52	60	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parasite"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Our data go further by suggesting that the parasite ’ s transmission mode changes according to the genetic basis of several life - history traits such as larval survival, adult size and longevity.	"parasite	43	51	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parasite"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The variation in the life - history traits of the host therefore has important consequences not only for the parasite but also for host ’ s fitness.	"parasite	109	117	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parasite"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Although molecular and physiological effects were not measured, our results therefore suggest that several life - history traits are genetically linked to the complex infection - related and immunity genes.	"infection	167	176	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""infection"", ""start_span"": 167, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Such a trade - off between life - history traits and immune response is often assumed [ 43] and supported by empirical studies [ 44, 45 ], including in our host - parasite system [ 39 ].	"parasite	163	171	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parasite"", ""start_span"": 163, ""end_span"": 171, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
But the results also support the idea that the parasites switch in an adaptive way their transmission mode according not only to the environment, but also to the genotype of the host they are infecting.	"parasites	47	56	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parasites"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This switch according to genetic background is necessary to let the parasite to achieve high success, for the families that permit more vertical transmission permit less horizontal transmission ( at least in the low - food conditions, where it was possible to investigate this trade - off ).	"parasite	68	76	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parasite"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The trade - off between vertical and horizontal transmission has important consequences for the evolution of, both, the parasite and the host, in particular because horizontal transmission is associated with higher virulence than vertical transmission [ 46 ].	"parasite	120	128	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parasite"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
For E. aedis, this association is necessary because of the parasite ’ s life - cycle, and more generally this trade - off is predicted by evolutionary theory [ 7, 8, 16, 47 ].	"parasite	59	67	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parasite"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In particular, with the expected selection of the host towards less damaging vertical transmission, we would expect a correlated response of the parasite to lower virulence thus reinforcing the evolution to vertical transmission.	"parasite	145	153	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parasite"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Third, while at high food hosts develop rapidly and almost always enable vertical transmission, we expect at low food and in the absence of parasite pressure that the host ’ s life - history evolves to delayed age at maturity [ 48 ].	"parasite	140	148	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parasite"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Under parasite pressure indeed, slow development hosts are more likely to die, whereas fast development host are favored but with a smaller size than the optimum and consequently with a cost in fecundity.

Although implication of light remains controversial, several studies indicate light exposure as a factor in the pathogenesis of ARMD [ 7 ], [ 8 ], [ 9 ], [ 10 ], [ 11 ], [ 12 ], [ 13 ].

Early stages in ARMD are usually associated with the formation of characteristic deposits underneath the retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE) and Bruch ' s membrane, called drusen [ 15 ], and with the accumulation of lipofuscin in RPE cells.

A greater toxicity of blue light was confirmed by exposing human RPE cells loaded with lipofuscin during 48 hours to blue - green light ( 390 – 550 nm, 2. 8 mW / cm2) compared to yellow - red light ( 550 – 800 nm, 2. 8 mW / cm2) [ 34 ].

Even if no induction of apoptosis was detected in the absence of A2E incubation ( Fig. 7E ), the increase in caspase - 3 / 7 activities was already statistically significant for the 440 nm illumination band with a 12. 5 µM A2E treatment ( Fig. 7F ).

Light is often considered as a potential risk factor for RPE dysfunction, and thus ARMD development [ 11 ]–[ 17 ], [ 41 ].	"ARMD	83	87	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ARMD"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
To investigate the phototoxic action spectrum in aging RPE cells, the disease has been modeled by loading cultured RPE cells with A2E [ 35 ], [ 36 ], [ 37 ], [ 38 ], [ 39 ], a photosensitizer, which accumulates in these cells during aging as in ARMD patients [ 38 ]–[ 42 ].

Indeed, filters in our narrow bandwidth would not occlude light in the 460 – 500 nm range, not only essential for color vision but also for pupil constriction and circadian rhythm regulation, both mediated by melanopsin - sensitive retinal ganglion cells.

The observed increased thermal stabilization of R131A with CAF - 25 and CAF - 26 suggests that mutation to alanine provides improved steric access to the pocket, leading to increased interactions with R10 and opposed R129 in addition to stabilization by K11 as seen in wild - type.

The introduction of antiangiogenic therapies aiming at preventing or regularizing the growth of vascularization in cancer tissues has aroused lively interest around promising imaging techniques capable of detecting vascular changes, thus providing fundamental information about treatments effectiveness before the appearance of morphological changes.

In fact, heterogeneity is an intrinsic characteristic of all tumours [ 9, 10 ], at several levels, ranging from genes to tissues [ 11 ], and this is also reflected in the hemodynamic behaviour, for instance, in areas of angiogenesis and necrosis [ 12 ].	"tumours	61	68	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumours"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
As a consequence, which part of the tumour could be the most representative one for clinical assessments has been widely debated.	"tumour	36	42	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Afterwards, the improvement of technology has permitted working on the whole tumour [ 14 ], or groups of slices, as the central ones [ 15 ].	"tumour	77	83	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
However, authors have still continued working on a single section only [ 16 ], chosen as the one representing the largest tumour diameter [ 17 ], or better incorporated the solid - appearing part of the target lesion [ 18 ], or else being in the middle scan position [ 19 – 21 ].	"tumour	122	128	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Nonetheless, several researchers choose the single tumour section based on visual considerations only [ 22 ], such as that having the best quality [ 23 ], or the widest area [ 24 ], jointly to the least variability [ 25 ].	"tumour	51	57	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In the literature, it has been widely stated that by considering the whole tumour [ 26 ], or even group of slices [ 27 ], perfusion parameters may improve reproducibility and repeatability [ 28 ], against a single slice.	"tumour	75	81	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
That is, considering a wider “ population ” ( i. e ., more slices ), averaging values helps achieving a “ global ” tumour behaviour.	"tumour	115	121	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
For instance, the overall mean of pulmonary index, pulmonary and bronchial blood flow ( BF ), is computed on multiple slices in [ 29] and on three tumour sections chosen according to the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes, in [ 30 ].	"tumour	147	153	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The overall median of all the CTp parameters for the whole tumour is computed in [ 14 ], where the median was preferred over the mean operator to avoid outliers.	"tumour	59	65	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
All the studies considered refer to global perfusion parameters, whether they are mean or median values, encompassing all the tumour characteristics.	"tumour	126	132	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
However, in this way, besides the uncertainty intrinsic to the CTp acquisition and processing procedure, global parameters also reduce the variability due to tumour heterogeneity.	"tumour	158	164	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 158, ""end_span"": 164, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
This is acknowledged by several authors, which recognize that global values only provide an overall measure of variability [ 31] and that “ may not be optimal for tumour evaluation prior to treatment or therapy response evaluation ” [ 32 ].	"tumour	163	169	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 163, ""end_span"": 169, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
For instance, the study in [ 33 ], dealing with CTp monitoring of antiangiogenic therapies in lung cancer, concludes that CTp can detect therapy - induced changes in perfusion, but the lack of reproducibility depletes these findings.

While it is widely agreed that considering tumour volumes give more information than using a single slice, usually single slices are merged together to provide global parameters.	"tumour	43	49	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The aim of this work is to investigate the clinical representativeness of global perfusion values and to assess their capability to deal with tumour heterogeneity.	"tumour	142	148	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
BF values for each voxel of the various tumour sections were calculated and showed through the use of colorimetric maps.	"tumour	40	46	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Global mean and median BF values of each slice and of the whole tumour were then computed.	"tumour	64	70	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The first statistical analysis was carried out to exclude that the groups of single slices composing the respective whole tumours had the same mean or median value.

To complete the analyses, a comparison between tumours with same global mean or median BF values was performed, so as to verify whether, and to what extent, a statistical equivalence of global perfusion values hints at similar perfusion patterns and heterogeneity features.

Lesions whose boundaries could not be accurately identified, such as in case of highly inflamed tissues surrounding the tumour, were excluded from the study.	"tumour	120	126	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Then, 50 mL of intravenous bolus of contrast agent ( Iomeron, Bracco, Milan, Italy) was administered to the patients at 5 mL / s.	"Iomeron	53	60	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Iomeron"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Due to the inclusion criteria, the number of slices where tumours are visible changes for each examination, but they are almost always visible for at least five slices.

Two 25 - year experienced radiologists analysed the whole sequences in cine - mode fashion and in agreement, for each examination, placed a circular region of interest ( ROI) within the aorta to extract the arterial input and, for each slice, drew a ROI following the margin of tumours.	"tumours	278	285	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumours"", ""start_span"": 278, ""end_span"": 285, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In this work, the entropy, E, was computed for the first time on the BF maps of the whole tumour ( Ew) and of each slice ( Es ), with the purpose to get a measure of the hemodynamic heterogeneity.	"tumour	90	96	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The range rE between minimum and maximum Ew values is also considered as a measure of the heterogeneity variability in the whole tumour. E measures are reported in arbitrary units ( a. u .).	"tumour	129	135	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
First, the one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA) was performed to check whether all slices ( the “ groups ”) of the same tumour have the same mean value, that is, whether they can represent the same population, in terms of BF values.	"tumour	123	129	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The same tests were also carried out to check for μs or Ms differences between couples of slices, whether they belonged to same tumour or different ones.	"tumour	128	134	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Finally, they were employed to select which tumours have the same statistical μw or Mw values, to further compare their perfusion patterns ( i. e ., their Ew ).	"tumours	44	51	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumours"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In fact, computing and using a global mean, or median, perfusion value for CTp studies implicitly means that sets of BF values ( e. g ., slices or whole tumours) with same μs ( or Ms) as μw ( or Mw) are clinically equivalent.	"tumours	153	160	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumours"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 160, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
To this purpose, we addressed tumours with different heterogeneities, referring to baseline and FUs examinations, by comparing those with the same global value.	"tumours	30	37	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumours"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In addition, whole tumours and their composing slices with same global values were compared as well.	"tumours	19	26	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumours"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Tables 1 and 2 report the most significant measures ( entropy, mean, and median) for all examinations, calculated on BF values of each slice and of the whole tumour.	"tumour	158	164	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 158, ""end_span"": 164, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Statistical analysis shows that ten slices exist which have the same global BF as the respective whole tumour, seven times regarding mean values, and eight ones median values.	"tumour	103	109	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Fifteen slices were representative of the whole tumour, thirteen of which regarding mean BF values, and eight pertaining to median values.	"tumour	48	54	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
As regards the whole sets of slices, the most meaningful result is that on the whole 93 slices were not represented by the global BF values computed on the whole tumour.	"tumour	162	168	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 162, ""end_span"": 168, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
As for the sets of whole tumours, here we analyse the sets of slices referring to two couples of meaningful lesions. Figure 6 shows the BF maps of the four consecutive slices ( 1 – 4, from ( a) to ( d )) of ID11 ( μw = 80. 0, first row) and ID6 - FU1 ( μw = 77. 5, second row ).	"tumours	25	32	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumours"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In particular, perfusion ' s heterogeneity is from decades a well - known characteristic of many tumours [ 40 ].	"tumours	97	104	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumours"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
However, functional results obtained from CTp are still analysed using global statistical indexes, such as mean or median operators, that many times permit measurement reproducibility, while disregarding tumour heterogeneity [ 43 ].	"tumour	204	210	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 204, ""end_span"": 210, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In this work, we have deeply analysed the representativeness of global mean and median values, as far as the heterogeneity is concerned, starting from the assumption that computing and using a global mean, or median, perfusion value for clinical purposes means accepting that the characteristics of the tumour are represented by that value alone.	"tumour	303	309	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 303, ""end_span"": 309, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Accordingly, this implies that sets of BF values ( e. g ., slices or whole tumours ), with statistically equivalent mean or median values, are equivalently representative.	"tumours	75	82	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumours"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Rather, it happened that in two examinations the whole tumour had mean and median BF values corresponding to the slice with the lowest heterogeneity ( ID12 and ID4, respectively ), while the remaining slices showed relevant clinical signs of different heterogeneities.	"tumour	55	61	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Global perfusion values computed on the whole tumour cannot be appropriate for therapy assessment and cannot improve the reproducibility of heterogeneity, accordingly.	"tumour	46	52	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
This is confirmed by the comparison between the average BF entropy of all slices before ( baseline) and after ( FU) treatment, proving the effectiveness of treatments themselves, expectedly reducing the overall BF heterogeneity of tumours.	"tumours	231	238	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumours"", ""start_span"": 231, ""end_span"": 238, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Indeed, using all the single slices of a tumour, endowed with global BF values and a BF heterogeneity measures, would represent a step forwards, useful to help radiologists to draw more reliable clinical considerations.

In addition, a study dedicated to validate the BF entropy as a surrogate biomarker for the overall survival is being carried out, based on the existing correlation between BF entropy and tumour grading.

It can also be seen that there are shared risk factors with non - stroke populations.	"stroke	66	72	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""stroke"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Our findings, therefore, are in - keeping with previous studies where female sex, older age, and previous falls were found to be associated with an increased risk of falls and fractures after stroke ( 9, 10, 18, 19 ).	"stroke	192	198	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""stroke"", ""start_span"": 192, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Atrial fibrillation is positively associated with fractures at 366 – 1, 095 days poststroke ( HR > 1 ), but shows a HR < 1 for the time interval 1, 096 – 1, 825 days poststroke.	"Atrial fibrillation	0	19	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Atrial fibrillation"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
This may be due to the loss of bone and muscle mass among other factors, such as polypharmacy, leading to frail patients with an increased risk of falls, as shown in non - stroke populations ( 22 – 24 ).	"stroke	172	178	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""stroke"", ""start_span"": 172, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Female sex has been previously linked to increased risk of being care dependent at 1 year after stroke as they are older and suffer from more geriatric comorbidities, female sex could, therefore, be seen as a marker of such factors not included in our study, which could further explain the associations shown ( 28 ).	"stroke	96	102	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""stroke"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Finally, the current study found that hyperlipidemia was associated with increased risk of falls.	"hyperlipidemia	38	52	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hyperlipidemia"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Malignancy and associated therapies have been consistently associated with bone loss ( 30, 31 ).	"bone loss	75	84	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""bone loss"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
This may be due to the long follow - up of our study and the possible increased mortality of patients with a history of cancer during the short - term follow - up period.	"cancer	120	126	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cancer"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
We also found that having a TACS or mRS score of 3 – 5 reduced fall and fracture risk.	"TACS	28	32	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""TACS"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
We acknowledge that the mRS score was not created to be applied to pre - stroke disability.	"stroke	73	79	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""stroke"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
We have used the current classification to be in line with the literature ( where mRS greater than or equal to 3 is regarded as an indicator of severe pre - stroke disability ).	"stroke	157	163	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""stroke"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 163, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Hypertension was also negatively associated with falls risk from 1 to 3 years.	"Hypertension	0	12	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Hypertension"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Bone mineral density decreases after stroke; however, we did not have these data and were, therefore, unable to adjust for this factor.	"stroke	37	43	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""stroke"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Despite these limitations, our study had strengths in the robust model construction, and we were able to control for multiple confounders and comorbidities over a long duration follow - up of 10 years and our discrete period analysis also allows better understanding of the changing risk factor profile with time after stroke.	"stroke	319	325	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""stroke"", ""start_span"": 319, ""end_span"": 325, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The results from this study imply that these identified factors should be considered in stroke patients to identify those at increased risk of having a fall or fracture post - discharge.

The starchy endosperm is the central storage tissue of the wheat grain and is the material from which white flour is produced.	"wheat	59	64	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Gradients exist in the distribution of gluten storage proteins within the starchy endosperm of developing and mature grain: these gradients are both qualitative and quantitative in nature ( Tosi et al ., 2011; He et al ., 2013 ), and influence both the milling properties and milling yield of the grain.

These individual mill streams are enriched with different parts of the wheat grain, and so gradients in endosperm protein concentration and composition will result in the production of mill streams with specific protein content, composition, and baking characteristics ( Yahata et al ., 2006; Wang et al ., 2007; Wan et al ., 2014; Zhou et al ., 2018 ).

This study, which focussed on limited microscale transects, demonstrated that the subaleurone cells had larger protein bodies, and it was speculated that they acted as a strong sink driving amino acid transport across the endosperm.

The future of wheat production for bread - making is likely to face many challenges, such as limits on the use of nitrogen fertiliser and changing climate, which, in the UK, will include increases in ambient temperatures experienced during grain filling.

Due to this, both financial and policy constraints are likely to limit the amount of nitrogen fertiliser that can be applied to future bread - making wheat crops.	"wheat	150	155	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 155, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

Nitrogen nutrition has been shown to affect the deposition of protein within the grain, with higher levels of nitrogen supply resulting in an increase in ω - gliadin accumulation in the outer layers of the starchy endosperm ( Wan et al ., 2014 ).

Previous analysis of protein gradients in wheat grain has been a low - throughput process, reliant on micro - dissection ( Cobb, 1905; Ugalde and Jenner, 1990a, 1990b ), sub - sampling of microscopy images ( Tosi et al ., 2011 ), or pearl milling ( He et al ., 2013 ).

Post - analysis, a conversion was applied to the data collected from the protein concentration gradient analysis: nitrogen content measurements made on grain sampled from the same plant and at the same timepoint were used to calculate a conversion factor between actual grain protein content and protein content as determined through microscopy - image analysis.

Grain nitrogen yield per plant was calculated from total grain yield and nitrogen concentration measurements, and was reduced by the low - nitrogen treatment ( P < 0. 001, F - test) ( Fig. 2H ), but was not significantly different between post - anthesis temperature treatments ( P = 0. 626, F - test) ( Fig. 2G ), and there was no significant interaction between nitrogen and temperature treatments ( P = 0. 649, F - test ).	"plant	25	30	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""plant"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Limiting nitrogen supply prior to anthesis also reduced the grain size ( Fig. 2D ), albeit to a lesser degree than elevated temperature, and the effect of nitrogen input on grain yield was less apparent in plants grown under elevated post - anthesis temperatures ( Fig. 2A ).	"plants	206	212	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""plants"", ""start_span"": 206, ""end_span"": 212, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The effect of decreased nitrogen supply on the grain protein concentration was greater in plants subjected to high post - anthesis temperatures than those grown under control temperatures, suggesting an increased sensitivity to nitrogen input at higher temperatures, and confirming previous reports ( Bhullar and Jenner, 1985; Gooding, 2010 ).	"plants	90	96	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""plants"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Although it is not possible to accurately predict weather conditions during grain - filling at the point of applying nitrogen to the crop during vegetative growth, data from this study may prove useful in cases where post - anthesis applications of nitrogen to wheat crops may have been scheduled and, more generally, in the context of years where higher summer temperatures are expected ( for example, in coincidence with El Niño / North Atlantic Oscillation weather phenomena ).	"wheat	261	266	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 261, ""end_span"": 266, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Reduction of nitrogen input, however, may add to the reduction in yield already observed in wheat grown under higher temperatures.	"wheat	92	97	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Elevated post - anthesis temperature affected both the gradient of total protein within the wheat grain endosperm, and the size distribution of protein bodies, with an increase in the steepness of the negative gradient observed between outer and inner endosperm tissue.	"wheat	92	97	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wheat"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
However, we also show that this potentially negative effect may be somewhat reduced by a reduction in the supply of nitrogen fertiliser to the plant prior to grain - filling.

The mean intrinsic HR ( ie, outwith autonomic influence) of young prepaced animals was 13% ± 7% faster than the resting HR ( predrug administration; p <. 05 ).	"animals	75	82	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

Aging is known to influence a number of cardiac physiological and structural variables including the occurrence of cardiac fibrosis ( 17, 23, 24 ), mitochondrial dysfunction, ( 25) and in the context of the present study, impaired inotropic reserve and exercise intolerance; the latter being considered hallmarks of aging ( 8 ).

The increase in resting HR with age, as well as the unaltered HR following full autonomic block noted in aged animals, suggests that there is a reduced parasympathetic component to the control of HR in aging.

Current Italian studies involving women with cytological abnormalities ( different ages and enrolment criteria) reported HR - HPV prevalence of 34 - 68 %, increasing with cytology severity: 24 - 56% in case of diagnosis of ASCUS / AGUS, 42 - 72% in LSIL and 73 - 95% in HSIL [ 21, 22, 26, 27, 30 - 32 ].	"HPV	126	129	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HPV"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This value is included in the range ( 15 - 50 %) reported in literature [ 33 ]; similar percentages of single and multiple HPV infections have been observed in young general populations [ 34, 35 ].	"HPV infections	123	137	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HPV infections"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Living with partner had a protective effect against HR - HPV infection in the multivariate model; consistently with another Italian study [ 38 ], being married and having children showed a protective effect in the crude analysis, although not statistically significant in the multivariate analysis.

Two other studies [ 11, 12 ], which detected HPV prevalence of a sample of Italian women aged 18 – 24 years randomly selected from population registries, got a lower participation rate ( 15 - 22 %).	"HPV	45	48	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HPV"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
As already mentioned, another limitation is that the prevalence of HPV 26, 53, 66, 73 and 82 could be heavily underestimated because they are not targeted by HR - HC2 test.	"HPV	67	70	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HPV"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The use of the same molecular method and laboratory network of the NTCC studies [ 8, 9 ], targeting women aged 25 – 60 years, allowed us to depict a comprehensive picture of HR - HPV prevalence in Italy from 18 to 60 years of age, observing in young adult women a peak of prevalence, which drops with increasing age.

In these circumstances, it appears that some students have difficulty engaging with the complexity implicit in residents with multiple comorbidities and dementia.

Indeed, a number of medical students questioned whether the clinical placement might be better positioned earlier on in the course when the pressures of pending hospital internships were less imminent: “ I think [ the placement] would be of more benefit to more junior medical students in interacting with the patients and getting exposure to the vast amount of clinical signs that you may or may not get to see in the hospital setting ” ( EM5041, 2013 ).

While some students struggled to discern the complexity among volunteer residents and viewed the clinical placement as an opportunity cost, others saw an opportunity to extend their competency and develop capability for independent clinical decision making, particularly with respect to the management of frail elderly people with dementia.	"dementia	331	339	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""dementia"", ""start_span"": 331, ""end_span"": 339, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
When these students were confronted by residents with dementia ( and other conditions that challenged their assessment capability ), they took up the challenge to extend their knowledge and skills.	"dementia	54	62	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""dementia"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
This student also recognised the value of this approach across clinical settings: If you can ’ t get good history [ from a person with dementia ], that ’ s an opportunity to talk to the nurse and [ to] see how much [ information] you can get from them [ about the resident ].	"dementia	135	143	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""dementia"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Then you can also speak to their families in order to get the full picture, and so you go through a process of investigating a particular patient with dementia and seeing how you take collateral histories … That ’ s useful no matter where you ’ re working ( BM5006, 2013 ).

When these students engaged with the challenges presented by interaction with residents with dementia, their reports suggested that they developed valuable skills that assisted them to become more resourceful clinical problem solvers.

Not only did I get exposed to the elderly and see their issues of cognition, falls risk, depression, but I really got to see and visualise how these problems interact … So many of the residents had those issues and I learnt from that … I think it ’ s definitely a beneficial [ placement] week and one that I ’ d recommend ( BM5061, 2014 ).

When I was speaking to her I said, “ These are the medical issues that I think are important, would you like me to see what could be done to address these ?” She really appreciated it, and she had some great ideas about what she ’ d like changed, and now it ’ s been given a voice [ in my recommendations ]… I ’ m really quite proud of what I found and what could potentially be put in place ( EM5030, 2013 ).

Medical students scored highly on the DKAT 2, indicating good knowledge of dementia before the placement, and displayed a significant increase in knowledge at the end of the placement.

Changes in dementia knowledge were supported by self - reported improvements in understanding of the aged care environment among the majority of students who responded to the post - placement survey.

Such skills will be critical in responding to the expansion of the older - adult population and growing prevalence of conditions such as dementia.	"dementia	137	145	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""dementia"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Although embedded placement experiences in aged care settings or interactions with people with dementia remain relatively uncommon within undergraduate medical education [ 9, 12 ], community based experiential learning is considered to offer advantages over classroom and simulation - based activities.

In this way, they are able to practise and refine their clinical decision - making skills in ways that can be carried over into diverse clinical settings, such as the treatment of a person with dementia in hospital and discharge into community care.

This design offered some advantages: ( 1) two flat surfaces for interaction with the biological microenvironment establishing a geometrically regular compartment once inserted in the animal model; ( 2) two jagged narrow edges ensuring a firm mechanical stability in the surgically created osteotomy; ( 3) a quite wide gap between the titanium surfaces and the osteotomy walls preventing the risk of rubbing against the osteotomy wall and damaging the titanium - bone interface when extracting the device; ( 4) an overall shape allowing to analyze early in vivo bone - implant retention and peri - implant microenvironment attached to the extracted implants overlooking the parameter “ implant design ” which actually plays a key role in low - density bone [ 15 ].

Subsequently, in order to highlight the pathways more relevant to cellular stress response, we further refined our analysis by excluding signaling pathway categories, such as cancer, cardiovascular and nervous system signaling, toxicity list and disease - specific pathways, in addition to non - skin cell - type - specific canonical pathways. Figure 10 shows a refined presentation of the top canonical pathways for each post - heat recovery time point.

For the cell cycle, the G1 / S checkpoint regulation pathway was affected in all three time points. The ceramide signaling pathway was affected in both 0 h and 4 h.	"ceramide	104	112	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ceramide"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Both endocytosis pathways, namely, macropinocytosis and clathrin - mediated endocytosis signaling pathways, play important roles in plasma membrane reorganization, internalization of extracellular molecules and in transduction of signals within the cell and between cells.

Deregulation of seven and 13 genes in macropinocytosis signaling and clathrin - mediated endocytosis signaling, respectively, starting 0 h post - heat, implicate an immediate effect of heat shock on the plasma membrane and signal transduction.

This finding is consistent with previous in vivo studies, which show that HSP70 expression is bi - phasic and peaks at both 12 h and 24 h post - exposure [ 5, 7, 8 ].	"HSP70	74	79	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""HSP70"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

This article utilises human case data from a high - endemicity region of the Democratic Republic of Congo in conjunction with a suite of novel mechanistic mathematical models to address the effectiveness of on - going active screening and treatment programmes and compute the likely time to elimination as a public health problem ( i. e. < 1 case per 10, 000 per year ).

While the single name “ sleeping sickness ” is commonly used, the disease exists in two distinct forms.	"sleeping sickness	24	41	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""sleeping sickness"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Most (> 98 %) cases occur in West and Central Africa and are caused by T. b. gambiense transmitted by the riverine species of tsetse.	"tsetse	126	132	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""tsetse"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The remaining 2% of cases are caused by T. b. rhodesiense transmitted by savanna species of tsetse.	"tsetse	92	98	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""tsetse"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The zoonotic nature of Rhodesian HAT means that complete elimination of the disease is unlikely [ 3 ].	"HAT	33	36	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HAT"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Hence, the goal of elimination is specific to Gambian HAT.	"HAT	54	57	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HAT"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The last bastion of Gambian HAT is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC) where 87% ( 3, 206 / 3, 679) of all cases reported in 2014 occurred.	"HAT	28	31	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HAT"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The results for 2014 are typical for the last 15 years ( 2000 – 2014 ): cases of HAT from the DRC have been between 58% ( 11, 481 / 19, 963 in 2003) and 91% ( 5, 647 / 6, 228 in 2013) of all cases reported globally [ 7 ].	"HAT	81	84	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HAT"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Within DRC itself, the distribution of HAT is also highly heterogeneous with three provinces being particularly important.	"HAT	39	42	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HAT"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Achieving the global elimination goal for Gambian HAT therefore depends on the impact of interventions in the DRC and these three provinces in particular.	"HAT	50	53	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HAT"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Control of Gambian HAT in DRC, as elsewhere, has depended almost exclusively on active case detection and treatment [ 9 ].	"HAT	19	22	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HAT"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Historically, vector control has not played an important role because of the cost and logistical complexities of traditional methods of tsetse control [ 10] and the emphasis on active screening continues to date.	"tsetse	136	142	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""tsetse"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
A key issue is whether continuing the current strategy is likely to result in the elimination of Gambian HAT in the DRC.	"HAT	105	108	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HAT"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
To address this question we have developed and applied a mathematical model of HAT to data from Yasa - Bonga and Mosango Districts in the Bandundu Province of DRC.	"HAT	79	82	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HAT"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Indeed some models assume that tsetse are susceptible at their first feed only and completely refractory thereafter [ 16, 17 ].	"tsetse	31	37	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""tsetse"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
There is however widespread agreement that there is a marked “ teneral phenomenon ” whereby susceptibility declines with the fly ’ s age [ 19 ].	"fly	125	128	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""fly"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Second, it is generally assumed that humans are the only host for T. b. gambiense.	"humans	37	43	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""humans"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
While these observations suggest that there are strong heterogeneities in the human population, the extent of this is not well quantified and likely to vary between settings.	"human	78	83	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Our understanding of the biology, behaviour and ecology of some species of tsetse is relatively good [ 4, 28 ].	"tsetse	75	81	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""tsetse"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Some aspects of the basic biology of all species of tsetse are very similar ( e. g. producing a single offspring at ~ 9 day intervals, both sexes taking bloodmeals at ~ 3 day intervals) and we can be reasonably confident in applying general values derived from one closely related species ( e. g. G. f. fuscipes) to provide parameter estimates such as the underlying daily mortality and feeding interval of G. f. quanzensis.	"tsetse	52	58	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""tsetse"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Until recently, this approach has had limited impact on health policy in impact in low - and middle - income countries and has been largely overlooked in the study of NTDs ( although onchocerciasis [ 33] is a notable exception ).

Given that there is no right model that can capture every element of the transmission process, and since many of the mechanisms are unknown for HAT, it is vitally important that multiple modelling assumptions are tested against the available data.	"HAT	144	147	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HAT"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 147, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Under each scenario, disease dynamics are projected forwards to determine the likely time to elimination as a public health problem and if this 2020 goal can be met for HAT.

During these years, active detection and treatment formed the primary component of HAT control programmes in this area with no large - scale vector control interventions being implemented [ 8 ].

The sensitivity and specificity of the active diagnostic algorithm were taken to be 91% and 99. 9% respectively based on the algorithms used by MSF in the Republic of Congo, Sudan and Uganda [ 38 ]; these algorithms involve multiple diagnostics including the Card Agglutination test for trypanosomes on whole blood ( CATT - WB) and parasitological examination of cerebral spinal fluid from lumbar puncture.

Estimates of underreporting for HAT are thought to be high, possibly in excess of 50% underreporting [ 37, 40, 41 ].	"HAT	32	35	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HAT"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
It is noted that the number of detected cases are a product of both the natural incidence of infection and the screening effort, with these two factors difficult to untangle in reporting data.

All heterogeneous human models ( Models 2 – 5) performed better than the simple model:	"human	18	23	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Model 4 ( low - risk random / high - risk non - participation) was the best fitting heterogeneous human model with realistic parameterisation.	"human	98	103	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
It was calculated that high - risk individuals were bitten r = 6. 6 times more and made up k4 = 7. 6% of the human population ( see SI Additional file 1: Table S1 ).	"human	109	114	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Results for Model 6 are shown as it forms a base - case for the inclusion of reservoir animals.	"animals	87	94	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The parameters of Model 7 suggest that an animal reservoir may play a small but significant role in transmission, but this may not be necessary to explain the data given that Model 4 fits almost as well.	"animal	42	48	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""animal"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Figure 3 shows best fits for the four models variants ( Models 1, 4, 6 and 7) and the reported incidence from the WHO HAT Atlas.	"HAT	118	121	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HAT"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
This elimination year is defined here to be the first year in which the incidence of new infections falls below 1 in 10 000 ( where the green lines cross ).	"infections	89	99	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""infections"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
These predicted elimination years and the basic reproductive ratio, R02, are given in Table 3 along with their 95% credible intervals.

With heterogeneity in humans, the time to elimination becomes longer, particularly if only mean screening levels are achieved each year.	"humans	22	28	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""humans"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In the fitted model without animal reservoirs ( Model 4 ), even maximum screening does not achieve WHO 2020 goals, with elimination as a public health problem being reached in 2074 ( 95% CI: 2060 – 2092 ).	"animal	28	34	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""animal"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The passive incidence is expected to cross this threshold by as much as 74 years before the new infection incidence crosses the same threshold ( Model 4, mean screening ).	"infection	96	105	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""infection"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Model fitting indicates that the past efforts of active detection and treatment in Yasa - Bonga and Mosango health zones of the DRC have halved ( 52 - 53% reduction) the number of new infections over a 15 - year period.	"infections	184	194	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""infections"", ""start_span"": 184, ""end_span"": 194, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Whilst there has been almost 80% reduction in reported cases for the whole DRC between 1998 – 2012 [ 7 ], Bandundu province of DRC remains one of the regions with the highest HAT burden globally, and it is therefore anticipated to be one of the toughest areas in which to meet this target.	"HAT	175	178	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HAT"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
It was also assumed that the passive detection rate and reporting levels were unaffected by active screening campaigns, however it may be that passive detection becomes greater with the increase in awareness of HAT in the area.	"HAT	211	214	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HAT"", ""start_span"": 211, ""end_span"": 214, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The model made use of constant human population sizes across the health zones, as very limited demographic data for these regions were available.	"human	31	36	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The model indicates that underreporting of HAT is high ( possibly as much as 77% underreporting ), which is in line with values suggested in the literature [ 40 ].	"HAT	43	46	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HAT"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Additional data, such as testing for HAT infection posthumously, would provide future models with more robust estimates for this value.	"HAT infection	37	50	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HAT infection"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Mechanistic models can help determine the incidence of new infections and so, in the future, could provide guidance as to when controls may be lifted without recrudescence occurring.

Modelling indicates that heterogeneities in the human population play an important role in recent disease dynamics.	"human	48	53	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Additionally, new improvements in drugs for the future treatment of HAT [ 9] may help improve participation in screening, for example if new drugs could be administered on an out - patient basis, or if the rest period following treatment were reduced.

These two health zones have not employed vector control as part of their intervention programme, and whilst promising new methods of tsetse control are emerging ( e. g. use of tiny targets [ 43, 44 ]) their use was not modelled here.	"tsetse	133	139	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""tsetse"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Since it is a novel strategy to this area, the quantitative impact of vector control on disease cannot be directly assessed, however by utilising and fitting to data sets ( both human case data and vector data) from regions with existing vector control ( such as Uganda and Guinea ), appropriate extensions to the existing model can be made and used to extrapolate into regions, like Yasa - Bonga and Mosango, where pre - vector control dynamics are known [ 27 ].	"human	178	183	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 178, ""end_span"": 183, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
It was concluded that active detection campaigns in this area are responsible for halving the number of new infections between 1998 and 2012, however this high - endemicity region is unlikely to achieve the WHO goal of 1 case per 10, 000 people per year by 2020.

The physiological mechanisms that lead to greater susceptibility among certain coral taxa and growth forms are not fully understood19, but may be associated with differences in the type of symbiont hosted9, metabolic rates20, tissue thickness11, mass transfer rates21 and heterotrophic feeding capacity22.	"coral	79	84	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""coral"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Thus, one might expect a more rapid adaptive response on reefs dominated by fast growing susceptible species ( providing that at least some of the coral population recovers following bleaching) 16.	"coral	147	152	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""coral"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The incidence of partial versus full colony mortality within a coral community following bleaching also has implications for the rate at which a reef recovers following a disturbance.	"coral	63	68	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""coral"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Reefs dominated by species with “ generalist ” life history traits ( i. e ., stress tolerance and rapid growth rates) 26 may recover coral cover rapidly via regrowth of remnant colonies, rather than relying on recruitment of new colonies from larvae2728.	"coral	133	138	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""coral"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In an earlier publication, Guest et al. ( 2012) 13, reported an unusual reversal in bleaching susceptibility among coral taxa and contrasting bleaching responses among sites in Singapore, Malaysia and Sumatra during 2010.	"coral	115	120	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""coral"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
To further examine the capacity for resistance of Singaporean reefs, here we report on the bleaching responses of corals at a reef site south of mainland Singapore during ( June, July) and immediately after ( October) the 2010 bleaching event.	"corals	114	120	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""corals"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Considering only taxa for which at least 5 colonies were sampled on all 3 occasions, 4 coral genera had consistently low susceptibility to bleaching ( i. e ., BI < 30) throughout the study period ( Supplementary Table S1 online, Fig. 2 ).	"coral	87	92	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""coral"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The genus Acropora was the least affected among all genera, with 82% of colonies surveyed in July ( at least 13 species surveyed) unaffected by bleaching with the remainder either pale or partially bleached and none severely bleached ( Table 2, Figs 2 and 3a – c ).	"Acropora	10	18	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Acropora"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
A further 7 genera had relatively moderate susceptibility to bleaching ( i. e ., BI from 30 – 59) in both June and July, but of these, all but one ( Porites) had low severity ( BI < 30) by October ( Supplementary Table S1 online, Fig. 2 ).	"Porites	149	156	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Porites"", ""start_span"": 149, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
All colonies of Porites surveyed in June and July were massive ( primarily P. lutea and P. lobata) or submassive ( P. rus ).	"Porites	16	23	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Porites"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Only one colony of branching Porites ( possibly P. cylindrica) was surveyed in October and it had suffered severe partial mortality ( 80% of colony ), suggesting it had experienced bleaching - related mortality.	"Porites	29	36	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Porites"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
For example, all Pocillopora colonies ( predominantly P. damicornis) were bleached, with 80% moderately and 20% severely bleached in July, but by October only 15% remained moderately bleached ( Supplementary Table S1 online, Figs 2 and 3d ).	"Pocillopora	17	28	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Pocillopora"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The massive taxa Porites, on the other hand recovered less quickly with 43% of colonies moderately or severely bleached in October, compared to 53% in July ( Supplementary Table S1 online, Figs 2 and 3e ).	"Porites	17	24	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Porites"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Average coral cover declined from 72. 2 ± 11. 1% ( mean ± SD) in 2009 to 50. 7 ± 8. 4% in 2010, but had partly recovered to 56. 0 ± 9. 1% by 2012.	"coral	8	13	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""coral"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
A total of 36 coral genera were surveyed before, during and after the bleaching event in 2009, 2010 and 2012 ( Supplementary Table S2 online ).	"coral	14	19	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""coral"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
While there were changes in relative cover of certain taxa before and after bleaching, there was no significant shift in coral taxonomic community structure among years ( One - way ANOSIM, Global R − 0. 08) suggesting that most differences in relative cover of taxa among years were a result of natural temporal variation.	"coral	121	126	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""coral"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In contrast, only one of the four taxa ( Pavona) that showed low bleaching susceptibility had declined in relative abundance between 2009 and 2012 ( Supplementary Table S2 online ).	"Pavona	41	47	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Pavona"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The taxa that had the highest bleaching index in October ( Porites) also had the greatest decrease in relative abundance between 2009 and 2012 ( Supplementary Table S2 online ).	"Porites	59	66	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Porites"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In five of the six corals sampled, clade D was the only symbiont type present, whilst clade C was only found in one sample of P. sinensis.	"corals	19	25	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""corals"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Surveys of four other sites around Singapore ’ s Southern Islands found similar reef - scale bleaching responses, suggesting that Pulau Satumu was representative of the broader coral community43.	"coral	177	182	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""coral"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 182, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Surveys to estimate bleaching - associated coral mortality carried out in October 2010 at Pulau Satumu revealed that an estimated 4% of colonies had died recently13.	"coral	43	48	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""coral"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In contrast, in the present study, Acropora were the least affected of all taxa, with 5, 18 and 4% of colonies moderately bleached in June, July and October, respectively.	"Acropora	35	43	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Acropora"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
For example a high proportion of surveyed Porites colonies ( 43 %) were still moderately or severely bleached in October.	"Porites	42	49	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Porites"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In light of these results, there is a clear need to re - evaluate the current paradigm regarding winners and losers among corals in the face of climate change.	"corals	122	128	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""corals"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Firstly, Singapore ’ s corals may host relatively thermally tolerant symbiont types.	"corals	23	29	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""corals"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
For hard corals in Singapore there are currently no published accounts of symbiont diversity for a wide range of species.	"corals	9	15	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""corals"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
However, limited sampling from two species that were relatively tolerant to thermal stress in 2010 ( P. damicornis and P. sinensis) using ITS2 tag pyrosequencing, reveal that whilst sequences related to Symbiodinium clades C and D were present, clade D predominated ( see Supplementary Table S3 online for details ).	"Symbiodinium clades C	203	224	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Symbiodinium clades C"", ""start_span"": 203, ""end_span"": 224, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The inability to classify the remaining OTUs to subcladal level based on current Symbiodinium ITS2 sequence databases suggests that they may represent novel subclades within clade D.	"Symbiodinium	81	93	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Symbiodinium"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Thirdly, it is conceivable that high concentrations of suspended particulate matter ( SPM) present in Singapore ’ s coastal waters, e. g ., ranging from 9 – 16 mg l − 1 55, may have provided an opportunity for corals to obtain a higher proportion of their energy requirements from heterotrophy during periods of thermal stress22.	"corals	210	216	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""corals"", ""start_span"": 210, ""end_span"": 216, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
A final possible explanation for the level of bleaching resistance at Pulau Satumu is that corals at this site possess greater tolerance to acute temperature fluctuations due to prior acclimatisation, i. e ., phenotypic changes by an individual organism in response to fluctuations in natural conditions56.	"corals	91	97	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""corals"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
It is well established that bleaching is induced when temperature increases significantly above the long - term mean annual maximum57 ( and references within) and that corals living at higher average ambient temperatures have higher thermal tolerances than those living at lower temperatures58.	"corals	168	174	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""corals"", ""start_span"": 168, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
On reefs with similar mean temperatures but differences in overall temperature fluctuations ( i. e ., differences in standard deviation around the mean ), corals that experience the larger fluctuations may also have greater thermal tolerance56.	"corals	155	161	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""corals"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The response of corals at Pulau Satumu to thermal stress has important implications for resilience.	"corals	16	22	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""corals"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Indeed, during surveys in October we regularly noted partial mortality due to disease on bleached colonies ( e. g ., Montipora, Fig. 3f ).	"Montipora	117	126	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Montipora"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that other anthropogenic disturbances ( e. g ., boat groundings and anchor damage from recreational vessels) also contributed to changes in coral cover between 2009 and 2012 at Pulau Satumu.	"coral	185	190	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""coral"", ""start_span"": 185, ""end_span"": 190, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In contrast, estimated rates of settlement of new coral spat at this site are low relative to other Indo - Pacific reefs6667.	"coral	50	55	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""coral"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
While recovery of coral cover from recruitment of new individuals via sexual reproduction can be a relatively slow process on reefs ( i. e ., decades ), recovery via regrowth of remnants can happen within a period of a few years2728, suggesting potential for rapid recovery at this site.	"coral	18	23	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""coral"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Indeed, the reef at Palau Satumu appeared to be on a rapid recovery trajectory, with coral cover increasing from ~ 50% in 2010 to ~ 56% in 2012.	"coral	85	90	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""coral"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In this study we show a remarkable level of resistance to, and recovery from, a major thermal coral bleaching event at a chronically impacted Indo - Pacific reef site.	"coral	94	99	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""coral"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
These results suggest an underappreciated resilience in disturbed impacted reef systems and that corals that have been classified as losers in the face of climate change may have a greater capacity for adaptation and / or acclimatization than previously supposed.	"corals	97	103	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""corals"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Although heavily impacted, most of Singapore ’ s islands have fringing reefs with relatively diverse coral communities, home to over 250 documented scleractinian species69.	"coral	101	106	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""coral"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
While it is one of the least impacted sites in Singapore, levels of sedimentation (~ 15 mg cm2 d − 1) and suspended solids (~ 10 mg l − 1) still exceed values considered normal for coral reefs55.	"coral	181	186	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""coral"", ""start_span"": 181, ""end_span"": 186, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

On survey occasions in June and July, coral colonies within four haphazardly placed 30 m × 1 m belt - transects were surveyed at depths between ~ 2 and 5 m along the reef flat and upper reef slope on the western side of Pulau Satumu.

Captive koalas seem unaffected when approached by tourists as they show no exterior signs of embarrassment, stress or disturbance, do not try to escape or, if they move out from the tourists, they do it as a slow pace.	"koalas	8	14	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""koalas"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
However, animals in stressful situations do not always show visible reactions.	"animals	9	16	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Escape is only one of the possible responses but some animals adopt other strategies, such as staying motionless while mimicking the environment.	"animals	54	61	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In some instance, stress can instead be revealed through an abnormally elevated heart rate in those species that remain motionless when approached by human.	"human	150	155	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 155, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Heart rate appears thus as a relevant measure of perceived stress in motionless animals.	"animals	80	87	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In this regard, koalas can be expected to display limited stress - response, at least visually, because of their highly - specialized feeding habits.	"koalas	16	22	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""koalas"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Their diet consists exclusively of Eucalyptus leaves that are extremely poor in proteins and also contains secondary metabolites ( e. g. terpens, lignins ...) that need to be detoxified before being assimilated [ 8 ].	"Eucalyptus	35	45	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Eucalyptus"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In other words, koalas ingest little amount of energy and expend a part of it to eliminate the toxic compounds of their food.	"koalas	16	22	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""koalas"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
With such a tight regime, the absence of escape behavior of koala due to a stressful situation could be regarded as an energy - saving behavior [ 1 ].	"koala	60	65	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""koala"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

Both loggers were temporarily attached to the fur of the upper back of the koalas ( between the shoulder blades) using adhesive tape ( Tesa, Germany) allowing for a quick attachment and retrieval of the devices ( without causing damage to the fur ).

The noose was placed and tightened around the neck of the koala to prevent it from climbing higher.	"koala	58	63	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""koala"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Once on the ground, koalas were kept in a capture bag, with only the top of their back free.	"koalas	20	26	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""koalas"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

As part of the study, an experimenter walked around the trees of Nugget ( around 7: 00 PM) and Crimson ( around 6: 45 PM) after all visitors had departed.	"trees	56	61	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""trees"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In mammals, a power spectral analysis of heart rate variability generates peaks at generally two frequency bands ( occasionally a third band, a very low frequency band is also recognized ), a low frequency ( LF) and a high frequency ( HF) bands [ 14 ]–[ 15 ].

We used a two - way Anova to test differences in heart rates between koalas and between periods of the day, followed by Student t post - hoc tests.	"koalas	69	75	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""koalas"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
During the day ( 1PM – 5PM) approx. a 110 people passed near the tree where Crimson stayed 8 – 10 m above the boardwalk.	"tree	65	69	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""tree"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Overall, most of the day activity for the three koalas, determined visually, consisted in scratching, shifting position, and sleeping.	"koalas	48	54	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""koalas"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Accelerometers confirmed that all koalas were more active during the night than the day ( Table 1 ).	"koalas	34	40	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""koalas"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The transition between the day and evening was sharp and occurred in a remarkably synchronized manner between the three koalas ( around 6: 30 PM, Fig. 2 ).	"koalas	120	126	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""koalas"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Note the drastic change in heart rate around 6: 30 PM for all koalas.	"koalas	62	68	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""koalas"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

To compare the heart rates of koalas in presence and absence of tourists, we only considered periods of complete inactivity, as determined from visual estimation and / or accelerometer signals.	"koalas	30	36	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""koalas"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The heart rates, hereafter, referred to as field resting heart rates ( HR ), of the three koalas differed significantly among individuals and between the day ( before 6 PM) and the night ( after 8 PM) periods ( F5, 44 = 44. 42, P < 0. 0001 ).	"koalas	90	96	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""koalas"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
During the day, Nemo displayed a lower HR than the two other koalas, whose HR did not differ ( Fig. 3 ).	"koalas	61	67	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""koalas"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In the evening, only the HR of Crimson was significantly greater than that of the two other koalas, whose HR were not significantly different.	"koalas	92	98	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""koalas"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In parallel, the power spectra distribution differed among koalas, as well as between the day and the evening, whether considering each period of inactivity successively ( Fig. 4) or averaged over the day and night ( Fig. 5 ).	"koalas	59	65	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""koalas"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
During the day, two weak LF peaks were found in both koalas ( one at 0. 01 Hz and one at 0. 07 Hz ), while only one peak subsisted in the evening ( the one at 0. 01 Hz ).	"koalas	53	59	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""koalas"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
HF peaks were found at 0. 17 – 0. 23 Hz in both koalas during the evening period but this peak disappeared during the day.	"koalas	48	54	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""koalas"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The HF range coincided with the respiratory range reported for koalas [ 16 ].	"koalas	63	69	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""koalas"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Spectral analysis of the heart rate variability during periods of inactivity throughout the recording periods for a) Nemo ( no contact with human ), b) Nugget and c) Crimson.

For all koalas, RMSSD values were low during the day and increased at night ( F5, 6974 = 576. 7, P < 0. 0001 ), while the ratio SDNN / RMSSD became lower at night than during the day for Nemo and Nugget but not for Crimson ( F5, 6942 = 456. 5, P < 0. 0001 ).	"koalas	8	14	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""koalas"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Our study represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first documentation of the continuous evolution of the heart rates of freely - living koalas, over several hours of the day and the evening.	"koalas	142	148	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""koalas"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Note that [ 18] suspected that their koala might not have been in real resting conditions so that their scaling law may not be a good representation for this species.	"koala	37	42	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""koala"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In comparison, we measured much higher average heart rate values in our semi - captive koalas during periods of immobility.	"koalas	87	93	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""koalas"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This is to be expected as our measurements do not represent absolute resting heart rates: we may have been out of the thermoneutrality zone of the animal, they may have eaten prior to the recording session or may have been affected by the presence of tourists ( see below ).	"animal	147	153	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""animal"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Moreover, none of the aforementioned studies provide any information about the temporal evolution of koalas ' heart rates.	"koalas	101	107	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""koalas"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Here, we found evidence for a circadian rhythm in cardiac activity of koalas, highlighted by a synchronized change among individuals in the average heart rate values and its variability occurring at the end of the afternoon.	"koalas	70	76	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""koalas"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This change is to be related with the pattern of activity of koalas that are mostly inactive during the day and show peak of activities, mainly feeding, classically between 5 PM and 12 AM [ 1 ].	"koalas	61	67	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""koalas"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
If the heart rate of Crimson was clearly higher than that of Nemo ( and both Nemo and Nugget in the evening period ), its important variability, especially during the day when compared to that of the two other koalas, is cause for concern.	"koalas	210	216	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""koalas"", ""start_span"": 210, ""end_span"": 216, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The single predominant peak of Crimson may be a reflection of parasympathetic activity since it was located in a zone close – yet not similar – to that of the high frequency peak in the power spectral analysis of the other koalas.	"koalas	223	229	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""koalas"", ""start_span"": 223, ""end_span"": 229, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Interestingly, Crimson ' s body mass ( 6 kg) is small for a 2 - yrs old koala.	"koala	72	77	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""koala"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Similarly, [ 20] reported body masses of 7. 0 – 8. 7 kg for a range of unknown age female koalas.	"koalas	90	96	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""koalas"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
While parasympathetic dominancy allows vertebrates to modulate rapidly their heart rate [ 7 ], [ 13 ]–[ 14 ], a preponderance of sympathetic nervous activity can be associated with activity or with a stressful situation.	"vertebrates	39	50	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""vertebrates"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Indeed, in the latter case, a corticotrophin - releasing factor is known to increase blood pressure and heart rate by stimulating noradrenergic sympathetic nervous outflow in stressed animals [ 21 ].	"animals	184	191	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 184, ""end_span"": 191, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
As koalas were relatively not active during the day, sympathetic dominant activity suggested they were subjected to stress.	"koalas	3	9	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""koalas"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Yet, although the three koalas displayed more activity during the evening than during the day, this was still limited to a few vertical movements.	"koalas	24	30	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""koalas"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This difference disappeared completely in the evening when both koalas displayed lower HR with higher variability.	"koalas	64	70	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""koalas"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Whether this difference in heart rate is solely the result of human presence can be debated yet its disappearance in the absence of the stimulus calls for future investigations in this direction.	"human	62	67	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Similarly, measurement of stress hormone levels, such as cortisol [ 24 ], would help quantifying the stress imposed by tourist proximity.	"cortisol	57	65	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cortisol"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In conclusion, and in order to confirm our preliminary results, we would like to encourage similar approach to be carried out onto larger samples of koalas and other species in conservation centers.

Here, we tested a group of 21 PD patients on and off stimulation ( off medication) by using the Cambridge Gamble Task ( CGT ), a computerized task that allows the investigation of risk - related behaviours and delay aversion, and psychological questionnaires such as the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale ( BIS ), the Sensitivity to Punishment and to Reward Questionnaire ( SPSRQ ), and the Quick Delay Questionnaire ( QDQ ).	"PD	30	32	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""PD"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In contrast, PD patients reported feeling more impulsive in the off stimulation state, as revealed by significantly higher scores on the BIS.	"PD	13	15	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""PD"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Moreover, DBS can be considered globally safe in terms of cognitive outcomes both in the short [ 1 ], [ 7 ], [ 8] and long term [ 6 ], [ 9 ], [ 10 ], even though single patients may develop a clinically relevant cognitive decline [ 11 ].	"cognitive decline	212	229	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cognitive decline"", ""start_span"": 212, ""end_span"": 229, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
For instance, it has been documented that, as compared to the off stimulation condition, PD patients on stimulation have a poorer performance in go / no - go tasks [ 25 ], [ 26 ], [ 27 ], stop signal tasks [ 28] and fail to slow down in selecting responses in a high - conflict context [ 29 ], [ 30 ], [ 31 ].	"PD	89	91	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""PD"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Interestingly, preclinical studies suggest that lesions to the STN may even improve delay aversion in rats [ 36 ].	"rats	102	106	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""rats"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

In the present study we aimed ( i) to investigate the effects that STN - DBS has on delay aversion in PD patients and ( ii) to explore possible short - term effects of STN - DBS on self - reported impulsivity.	"PD	102	104	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""PD"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Previous animal studies [ 44 ], [ 45] have suggested that, in the rat, lesions to the STN have opposite effects on behaviour: increasing impulsive actions but reducing delay aversion [ 33 ].	"rat	66	69	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""rat"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
So far, most of the studies investigating motor ( and cognitive) impulsivity in PD patients have found that STN - DBS has detrimental effects on impulsivity as measured by go / no - go tasks [ 25 ], [ 46 ].	"PD	80	82	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""PD"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Moreover, PD patients under STN - DBS have been found to increase impulsive action [ 48 ]: STN - DBS, acting detrimentally on the ‘ hyperdirect ’ circuit connecting the medial prefrontal cortex ( mPF) and the STN [ 49 ], [ 50 ], [ 51 ], disrupts the ability to refrain from selecting choices without pondering ( DBS ).	"PD	10	12	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""PD"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
A recent study by Rodriguez - Oroz and colleagues [ 52] has suggested that patients showing dopaminergic side effects have, in the on state, a characteristic oscillatory activity in the theta - alpha band at different frequencies and with different topography if they suffer from motor ( such as dyskinesias) or behavioural side effects ( abnormal impulsivity ).	"dyskinesias	296	307	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""dyskinesias"", ""start_span"": 296, ""end_span"": 307, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Our present findings suggest that STN - DBS does not worsen delay aversion and demonstrate that also in humans not all impulsivities are detrimentally affected by DBS of the STN.	"humans	104	110	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""humans"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
An alternative explanation proposed to explain the differences between betting behaviours in the on and off medication conditions states that delay aversion as measured by the GCT reflects ‘ impatience ’, that is, the inability to undergo delay without action [ 22 ].	"impatience	191	201	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""impatience"", ""start_span"": 191, ""end_span"": 201, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In this view, impatience could be favoured by different perception of time in the two therapeutic conditions, and in particular by a perception of time going by more slowly in the on medication condition [ 55 ], [ 59 ], [ 60 ], [ 61 ].	"impatience	14	24	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""impatience"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The possibility that delay aversion, as measured by the CGT, reflects impatience is supported by the negative correlation found between delay aversion on the CGT and delay aversion scores on the DA subscale of the QDQ.	"impatience	70	80	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""impatience"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
These findings are in apparent contrast with previous studies suggesting that PD patients on stimulation report higher scores of self - assessed impulsivity [ 18 ].	"PD	78	80	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""PD"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In contrast, Funkiewiez and colleagues [ 64] reported that both stimulation and medication were able to improve subjective feelings of well - being, euphoria and motivation, and to decrease anxiety and fatigue.

This issue is of great importance also from a clinical standpoint, in order to understand better and reduce the risk of post - operative suicidal behavior observed in some studies [ 68 ], possibly related not only to depression but also to impulsive behaviour.

The present study demonstrates that the digestibility of rice protein affected by extraction method plays a major role in the modulation of cholesterol metabolism.	"cholesterol	140	151	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cholesterol"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Results suggest that the hypocholesterolemic action induced by rice protein with lower digestibility primarily contribute to the inhibition of cholesterol absorption.	"cholesterol	29	40	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cholesterol"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Recent attempts have been focused on the physiological functions of rice to prevent the life style - related diseases [ 1 – 4 ], in which the association of rice protein ( RP) consumption with modulation of plasma cholesterol level has been demonstrated in some studies [ 5 – 9 ].	"cholesterol	214	225	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cholesterol"", ""start_span"": 214, ""end_span"": 225, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
As for isolation of rice protein, alkaline treatment and α - amylase degradation are two major industrial processing [ 5, 10 ].	"α - amylase	57	68	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""\u03b1 - amylase"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Alkaline treatment is a common process for rice protein extraction, by which the digestibility of rice protein is suggested to be effectively improved rather than by α - amylase degradation [ 5, 11, 12 ].	"α - amylase	166	177	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""\u03b1 - amylase"", ""start_span"": 166, ""end_span"": 177, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Some studies have suggested that the biological utilization of a protein is primarily dependent on its digestibility by gastric, pancreatic and intestinal peptidases [ 13 – 15 ], further providing the insight that the digestibility may play a major role in the modulation of physiological function of dietary protein.	"intestinal peptidases	144	165	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""intestinal peptidases"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 165, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Thus, the digestibility of rice protein may be a major factor to influence cholesterol metabolism.	"cholesterol	75	86	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cholesterol"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Therefore, in the present study, two extraction methods for preparation of rice protein, namely, an alkaline treatment and heat - stable α - amylase degradation, were developed to evaluate and compare the physiological function of rice protein.	"α - amylase	137	148	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""\u03b1 - amylase"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

Two methods were conducted for preparation of rice proteins, a classical extraction method with alkaline followed by precipitation with acidic solution ( RP - A) [ 5 ], and a method for rice protein isolation by starch degradation using a heat - stable α - amylase ( Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) ( RP - E) [ 5 ].

Ash and lipid contents were almost negligible in all dietary proteins ( CAS, 2. 2 %; RP - A, 1. 8 %; RP - E, 2. 3 %).	"CAS	72	75	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CAS"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
It is notable that the contents of fiber in RP - A and RP - E were higher than the contents of carbohydrate in them.	"carbohydrate	95	107	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""carbohydrate"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
To explain this phenomenon, the washing procedure, during which carbohydrate might be lost, should be taken into account in this study.	"carbohydrate	64	76	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""carbohydrate"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Interestingly, the residual of fiber was higher in RP - E after α - amylase extraction than that in RP - A extracted by alkaline, implying alkaline treatment could reduce the fiber content in rice protein extract.	"α - amylase	64	75	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""\u03b1 - amylase"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The amino acid compositions were shown in Table 3.	"amino acid	4	14	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""amino acid"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
As compared with CAS, rice proteins have higher levels of Asp, Glu, Gly, Ala, Cys and Arg, whereas they have lower content of Lys, Thr and Pro.	"CAS	17	20	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CAS"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
As a result, the higher ratio of Arg / Lys was found in RP - A ( 2. 56) and in RP - E ( 3. 15) than that in CAS ( 0. 44 ).	"CAS	108	111	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CAS"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
As a result, the ratio of non - HDL - C / HDL - C was significantly lowered by 29. 7% and 34. 4% in RP - A and RP - E, respectively, compared with CAS.	"CAS	147	150	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CAS"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
With the decreased plasma TC, plasma TG concentration was also lowered by RP feeding, as compared with CAS ( Table 4 ).	"CAS	103	106	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CAS"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
As for the ratio of TG to HDL - C, the decrease was found in RP - A and RP - E compared to CAS, but there was no significant difference of TG / HDL - C ratio among experimental groups ( P > 0. 05 ).	"CAS	91	94	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CAS"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The liver weights in growing rats fed RP - E did not differ from those fed RP - A ( P > 0. 05) ( Table 5 ).	"rats	29	33	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""rats"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
With the similar tendency of hepatic lipid accumulation, the deposits of perirenal fat and epididymal fat were also inhibited by RP - A ( perirenal fat: 9. 5 %; epididymal fat: 9. 5 %) and RP - E ( perirenal fat: 12. 2 %; epididymal fat: 12. 3 %), as compared with CAS.

As shown in Table 6, fecal neutral sterol excretion was significantly stimulated with RP - feeding ( P < 0. 05 ).	"sterol	35	41	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sterol"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
These results clearly indicated that RP - E could produce more excretion of fecal sterols than those in RP - A group ( P < 0. 05 ).	"sterols	82	89	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sterols"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
There was no difference of fecal triglyceride output was found in RP - E and RP - A ( P > 0. 05 ).	"triglyceride	33	45	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""triglyceride"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
As a result, apparent cholesterol absorption was more effectively inhibited by RP - E than RP - A ( Figure 3 ).	"cholesterol	22	33	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cholesterol"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In the present study, our data suggested that the fecal excretion of bile acids can be affected by the digestibility of RP.	"bile acids	69	79	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""bile acids"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
These findings support the previous studies that alkaline treatment may improve the digestibility of rice protein [ 11, 12 ], suggesting that RP - A appears to have less influence on binding bile acids in the intestinal tract due to its higher digestibility, in line with our previous findings [ 6 ].	"bile acids	191	201	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""bile acids"", ""start_span"": 191, ""end_span"": 201, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In this study, we provided the in vivo and in vitro evidences for the lower digestibility of RP as compared with CAS.	"CAS	113	116	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CAS"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
These results confirmed the finding that the digestibility of RP - E extracted by α - amylase was significantly lower than RP - A by alkaline treatment, further supporting the view that the digestibility of RP could be affected by the processing of extraction [ 5, 11, 12 ].	"α - amylase	82	93	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""\u03b1 - amylase"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
These data clearly indicated that there was a close link of lower protein digestibility and cholesterol - lowering action exerted by RP.	"cholesterol	92	103	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cholesterol"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Also, we did not observe a difference of liver cholesterol - lowering effect between RP - E and RP - A.	"cholesterol	47	58	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cholesterol"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The precise mechanism by which RP affects cholesterol metabolism is not fully understood, but the mechanism responsible for the effect on the removal of non - HDL - C from circulation by hepatic uptake should be taken into account.	"cholesterol	42	53	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cholesterol"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Clearly, the observed effect of RP on cholesterol metabolism remains to be clarified in further studies.	"cholesterol	38	49	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cholesterol"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Results shown by Vahouny et al. indicated that the addition of Arg to a CAS diet to increase the Arg / Lys ratio resulted in a slower rate of lipid absorption, and the addition of Lys to the soy protein diet to decrease the Arg / Lys ratio caused a faster rate of lipid absorption.	"CAS	72	75	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CAS"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Thus, whatever the mechanism of action, the effect of Arg / Lys ratio on cholesterol metabolism is important.	"cholesterol	73	84	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cholesterol"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
This may explain the phenomenon that RP - E containing more dietary fiber could not produce more effective cholesterol - lowering effect than RP - A.	"cholesterol	107	118	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cholesterol"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The present study demonstrates that digestibility of rice protein plays a major role in the modification of cholesterol metabolism.	"cholesterol	108	119	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cholesterol"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The hypocholesterolemic action of rice protein is attributed to the enhanced fecal excretion of neutral sterols, varying with the digestibility of rice protein.	"sterols	104	111	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sterols"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Understanding regional water quality changes in southern African dryland rivers and wetland systems is especially important because of their high subsistence value and provision of ecosystem services essential to both public and animal health.

Analysis of the relationship between terrestrial fecal loading and bacterial concentrations showed a significant positive influence of elephant - specific fecal count ( FC) ( p = 0. 017) and other wildlife species FC ( p = 0. 001) on E. coli concentrations in the dry season ( Table 4 ).

The ISH assay revealed that uc. 134 expression was significantly decreased in 170 paraffin - embedded samples from patients with HCC compared with adjacent tissues and uc. 134 expression directly correlated with patient prognosis.

In fact, a recent report of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine ( AASM) does not recommend the use of portable monitoring for OSAS screening in such patients because there is still little if any evidence on its effectiveness [ 11 ].

The role of patients ' concerns about psychological distress and their adjustment to disease, poor coping strategies, and some personality traits that are commonly associated with these diseases are introduced.	"psychological distress	38	60	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""psychological distress"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
To date, there is no certain cure for IBD, and treatment is aimed at managing the inflammatory response during flares and maintaining remission with a focus on adhering to therapy [ 2 ].	"IBD	38	41	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""IBD"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The etiology of IBD is unknown, but genetic, immune, and environmental factors are each thought to play a role in its causation [ 1, 3, 4 ].	"IBD	16	19	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""IBD"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
These factors interact together, so in a person who is predisposed genetically, environmental factors trigger immune dysfunction and bowel symptoms [ 5 ].	"immune dysfunction	110	128	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""immune dysfunction"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
One of these environmental triggers may be psychological factors particularly psychological stress.	"psychological stress	78	98	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""psychological stress"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
A belief in the relevance of psychological factors to IBD is not new.	"IBD	54	57	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""IBD"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
For a while IBD was considered as an organic disease, and psychological influences were discounted as contributing to it.	"IBD	12	15	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""IBD"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
But further anecdotal evidence and clinical observations indicated that stressful experiences could adversely affect the course of IBD.	"IBD	131	134	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""IBD"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
These conclusions provide support for the beliefs of almost 75% of patients with IBD that stress, or their own personality is a major contributor to the development of their disease [ 10, 12 ], and of more than 90% that it influences their disease activity [ 13, 17 ].

In the light of recent advances in psychobiological research, what are the mechanisms by which the course of IBD can be influenced by stress?	"IBD	109	112	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""IBD"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Many of the IBD symptoms experienced by patients may be due to stress - induced changes in gastrointestinal ( GI) function.	"IBD	12	15	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""IBD"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
GI motor, sensory and secretory function as well as thresholds for the perception of pain [ 13 ], can be affected by psychological and emotional stress directly or indirectly through this axis.

Psychological stress can also increase intestinal permeability, probably as a result of alterations in the cholinergic nervous system and mucosal mast cell function [ 21 ].	"Psychological stress	0	20	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Psychological stress"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
This increased permeability in turn reduces mucosal barrier function and alters bacteria - host interaction [ 12, 23 ].	"bacteria	80	88	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bacteria"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Finally, stress is also likely to mediate its effect on IBD through the immune system [ 15, 19 ].	"IBD	56	59	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""IBD"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
On the one hand, it is believed that an inadequately controlled response within the intestinal mucosa leads to inflammation in patients who are genetically predisposed to IBD.	"IBD	171	174	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""IBD"", ""start_span"": 171, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In addition to the above - mentioned direct pathways, stress can also indirectly affect clinical course of IBD.	"IBD	107	110	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""IBD"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Once IBD develops, the unpredictability, uncertainty, and chronic course of the disease can cause a wide range of psychological and interpersonal concerns to patients.	"IBD	5	8	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""IBD"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Indeed, symptoms, such as faecal incontinence or soiling and lack of bowel control, can lead to a loss of self - unworthiness or cause stigmatization in patients [ 33, 34 ].	"faecal incontinence	26	45	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""faecal incontinence"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Unfortunately, however, a variety of studies suggest that IBD patients rely significantly on passive coping strategies [ 34, 35 ], utilizing fewer purposeful problem solving and positive reappraisal, and more escape - avoidance strategies [ 36, 37 ].	"IBD	58	61	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""IBD"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Concerns such as those listed above on the one hand, and passive and / or avoidant coping on the other hand, lead to psychological distress [ 38] with maladaptation and poor adjustment to the disease.	"psychological distress	117	139	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""psychological distress"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Sewitch et al. [ 39] and Mikocka - Walus et al. [ 40] using Symptom Checklist - 90 - R ( SCL - 90) indicated that IBD patients had impaired psychological functioning.	"IBD	114	117	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""IBD"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
When patients receive a new diagnosis of IBD, a series of psychological adaptive steps occurs.	"IBD	41	44	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""IBD"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Sewitch et al. [ 39] revealed that the relationship between psychological distress and perceived stress changes according to the level of satisfaction with social support.	"psychological distress	60	82	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""psychological distress"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Moreover, Pellissier et al. [ 41] suggested that negative effect was associated with poorer coping to IBD.	"IBD	102	105	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""IBD"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Indeed, some patients with IBD believe that their own personality is a major contributor to the development of their disease [ 17 ].	"IBD	27	30	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""IBD"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

The latter may be particularly detrimental for IBD patients because these conditions are often accompanied by stigma, shame, feeling of dirty, and a burden [ 47 ].	"IBD	47	50	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""IBD"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The above investigators have shown a relationship between perfectionism and the psychological impact of IBD, so as the trait was associated with emotional preoccupation coping a maladaptive coping way with disease.

Although discrete personality traits have been studied among IBD patients, no certain personality type matches this disease to date.	"IBD	61	64	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""IBD"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
It is recommended that future research considers discrete personality traits observed in these patients and integrates them in such a way that the traits will be addressed to new personality types such as type D [ 51, 52] and C [ 53 ], which are well matched with unregulated immune and hormonal systems that are characteristics of IBD.	"IBD	332	335	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""IBD"", ""start_span"": 332, ""end_span"": 335, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Once a patient develops IBD, he / she usually might form adaptive adjustment to it and accept the condition.	"IBD	24	27	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""IBD"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Sometimes when patient has weak coping skills or social support or he / she may be personally predisposed ( some personality trait such as neuroticism ), he / she may feel frustrated, sad, and avoid social events.	"neuroticism	139	150	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""neuroticism"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
According to Seligman ' s theory [ 56 ], unpredictable and incurable course of disease impaired individual ' s belief about self - control [ 33] and self - efficacy [ 23, 32, 57] and thereby caused helplessness and predisposed the patient to depression.	"depression	242	252	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""depression"", ""start_span"": 242, ""end_span"": 252, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
[ 13] suggest that psychological disturbances as a component of the illness may modulate its clinical expression, rather than being etiologic or specific to IBD.	"IBD	157	160	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""IBD"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 160, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
IBD generally begins in child - or young adulthood and lasts life - long.	"IBD	0	3	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""IBD"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Relevant factors include those discussed above, the chronicity of IBD, its complications, associated physician visits and hospitalizations, and side effects of medical treatment or surgery.	"IBD	66	69	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""IBD"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
It is not surprising, therefore, those patients with active IBD have poorer disease - specific quality of life relative than those with inactive disease [ 35, 72 – 74 ].	"IBD	60	63	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""IBD"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Of course, poor HRQOL is not restricted to active episodes, and the negative impact of IBD on patients quality of life continues even when it is inactive.	"IBD	87	90	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""IBD"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
However, the physical symptoms of IBD do not completely explain the reductions of HRQOL in affected patients because disease activity and the intensity of patients ' symptoms do not significantly correlate with their subjective impairments [ 77 ].	"IBD	34	37	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""IBD"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
For example, Sainsbury and Heatley [ 35 ], Casellas et al. [ 70 ], and Haapamaki [ 71] listed the effects of gender ( women had poorer QOL than men ), level of education, socioeconomic status, and older age on HRQOL in IBD patients.	"IBD	219	222	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""IBD"", ""start_span"": 219, ""end_span"": 222, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Furthermore, Moreno - Jiménez et al. [ 44] and Boye et al. [ 45] suggest that factors such as personality traits may influence psychological well - being and HRQOL; in their studies, neuroticism and greater difficulty in describing feelings to others were related to poorer HRQOL.	"neuroticism	183	194	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""neuroticism"", ""start_span"": 183, ""end_span"": 194, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

For example, a patient with ulcerative colitis who suffers from abdominal pain may not go to the physician if he / she has previously experienced those symptoms without serious consequences, or if he / she has grown up in a family where attention to illness has been minimal, or if he / she believes that complaining might be regarded as weakness.	"ulcerative colitis	28	46	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ulcerative colitis"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
For the above reasons, physicians need to establish a close and effective therapeutic relationship with their patients, be sensitive and responsive to their patients ' concerns about IBD, provide information consistent with the patients ' questions and needs, and educate their patients properly about their condition and planned treatment, thereby reducing patients ' concerns and uncertainties and their dependency on the healthcare system.

More work is needed to assess the proposal that psychological approaches could affect the course of IBD itself.	"IBD	100	103	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""IBD"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Numerous psychological interventions have been developed and studied in IBD, with a range of outcomes.	"IBD	72	75	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""IBD"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Keller et al. [ 80] and Wietersheim et al. [ 81] reported that supportive - expressive and psychodynamic therapy may be ineffective in the treatment of psychological comorbidities and somatic course of IBD.	"IBD	202	205	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""IBD"", ""start_span"": 202, ""end_span"": 205, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Recent systematic review by Mikocka - Walus et al. [ 97] even reported that antidepressants have positive effect on inflammation of the bowel in IBD patients.	"IBD	145	148	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""IBD"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Since the most published data in this area have not been randomized and have methodological weaknesses, Hardt et al. [ 63] concluded that it is impossible to make a definitive statement of efficacy of antidepressants on mental and somatic status of IBD patients.	"IBD	249	252	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""IBD"", ""start_span"": 249, ""end_span"": 252, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Overall, while there are contradictory reports on the effect of psychological interventions on clinical course of IBD, most show a positive effect on psychological and emotional status and HRQOL.	"IBD	114	117	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""IBD"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
With regard to recent findings about the effect of psychological interventions on immune modification [ 97, 98] and reducing the likelihood of relapse [ 57 ], the necessity of incorporating them to conventional treatment protocol of IBD is more illustrated.	"IBD	233	236	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""IBD"", ""start_span"": 233, ""end_span"": 236, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Most importantly, in view of the importance of psychological dysfunction in modifying illness behavior and its negative impact on symptoms and QOL, the integration of psychological interventions into conventional medical therapy, seems advisable.	"psychological dysfunction	47	72	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""psychological dysfunction"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Where further study is most urgently needed, however, it lies in the analysis of the precise effects of these interventions on not only psychological state and quality of life, but also on the physiological parameters and the course of IBD itself.

B30. 2 domains are also found on some tripartite motif containing ( TRIM) proteins [ 23] and on the PYRIN molecule [ 24] ( Fig 2) and have several roles related to immunity.	"PYRIN	100	105	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PYRIN"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
However, additional studies are required to determine what, if any, role in the immune system NLR - C molecules may play.	"NLR - C	94	101	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NLR - C"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The evolutionary processes generating the vast subfamily of NLR - C genes are not clear and appear very complex.	"NLR - C	60	67	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NLR - C"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
However, evidence suggesting tandem duplications of individual genes within a chromosomal locus is consistent between Zv6 and Zv7, which result in NLR - C genes adopting new exons encoding distinct N - terminal domains and / or C - terminal domains via exon - shuffling.	"NLR - C	147	154	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NLR - C"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The clusters of tandem NLR - C genes appear to have undergone en bloc duplication, to generate further clusters in the same locus ( cis duplication ), or within distinct loci or chromosomes ( trans duplication) through translocation.	"NLR - C	23	30	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NLR - C"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Therefore, many NLR - C genes may be non - functional genes or pseudogenes, although a small number have likely established new functions.	"NLR - C	16	23	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NLR - C"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

One possible reason was that nCPAP creates a positive pressure during both inspiration and expiration in the nasopharyngeal cavities which functions as a pneumatic splint that prevents UAO by pushing the soft palate and the tongue forward and away from the posterior pharyngeal wall [ 10, 22 ].

BMP - 2 stimulates chondrocyte proliferation in the proliferative zone of the growth plate and also causes an increase in chondrocyte hypertrophy [ 26 ].	"BMP - 2	0	7	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 2"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In this context, it has been suggested that alterations in the expression or production of BMP - 2 can modulate the proliferation and activity of bone forming cells.	"BMP - 2	91	98	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 2"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In the present study, protein expression of BMP - 2 in growth plate was highly expressed in hypertrophic and ossification zones compared to resting and proliferative zones ( Figure 4 ( a )).	"BMP - 2	44	51	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 2"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
As expected, BMP - 2 expressions particularly in hypertrophic and ossification zones of the growth plates were increased in the VAU and VAM treated groups compared with the control group ( Figures 4 ( a) and 4 ( b )).	"BMP - 2	13	20	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 2"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Numerical values of the BMP - 2 expression were increased by 25. 8 %, 24. 7 %, and 10. 5% with VAU, VAM, and VAB treatment, respectively, compared with control ( Figure 4 ( b )).

Therefore, the effect of VA on ALP activity in MG - 63 cells was further determined at 50 and 100 μg / mL concentration.	"ALP	31	34	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ALP"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
VAU treatment significantly increased the ALP activity, an early - stage osteoblasts differentiation marker, at 100 μg / mL concentration ( P < 0. 05, Figure 5 ( b )) compared with control.	"ALP	42	45	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ALP"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
VAM and VAB failed to affect ALP level.	"ALP	29	32	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ALP"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Hence, collagen content ( Figure 5 ( c )) and calcium deposition ( Figure 5 ( d )) were determined at 100μg / mL of VA concentration.	"collagen	7	15	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""collagen"", ""start_span"": 7, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

For example, the divergence between accepted species of Goussia varied between 0. 4 – 5. 8 %, so the lineages found in S. japonicus and D. labrax likely belong to three different species ( minimum p - distance = 0. 4 %, see Additional file 3: Table S1 ).	"Goussia	56	63	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Goussia"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
On the other hand, sequences of Goussia spp. recovered from the intestines of D. sargus and S. aurata were identical and likely corresponded to a single species different from the species for which data are currently available ( p - distance between this lineage and other sequenced species varied between 2. 2 – 5. 8 %).	"Goussia spp	32	43	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Goussia spp"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Divergence between the three previously sequenced Calyptospora species ranged between 5. 2 – 7. 2% ( Additional file 3: Table S2 ), which led us to consider that the lineages from T. trachurus may belong to a single species ( p - distance ranged between 0. 2 – 1. 2 %), as well as the lineages found in P. caeruleostictus ( p - distance ranged between 0. 2 – 0. 4 %) and T. luscus ( p - distance ranged between 0 and 1. 9 %).

In our opinion, this discrepancy is due to differences in the 18S rRNA gene fragments employed and the wider range of taxa in our analysis, including members from an undescribed Apicomplexa group.

Although sequence data are becoming essential tools for studying the Apicomplexa ( e. g. [ 7, 30 – 33 ]), the strict use of molecular data for species identification can be hampered in the absence of morphological characterisation and requires this results should be interpreted with caution ( e. g. [ 34 ]).	"Apicomplexa	69	80	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Apicomplexa"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This is in line with previous results [ 8] where intraspecific variation could be as high as 4. 2% in Calyptospora spinosa.	"Calyptospora spinosa	102	122	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Calyptospora spinosa"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

A third parasite lineage, likely Eimeria cf. variabilis, was recovered in farmed and reported from wild D. labrax; and a Goussia sp. infected both farmed S. aurata and farm - associated D. sargus.

Here, we found three genotypes that likely correspond to three Eimeria spp ., in the intestine of two in D. labrax and one in T. luscus.	"Eimeria spp	63	74	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Eimeria spp"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
However, there are also reports of an unidentified Eimeria species in the intestine of wild D. labrax off the coasts of Portugal [ 45 ].	"Eimeria	51	58	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Eimeria"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Similarly, in T. trachurus several parasitic genotypes, recovered as closely related with Calyptospora and G. clupearum, were found in host liver, stomach and intestine.

So far, Goussia lusca is the only coccidian parasite reported to infect T. luscus, and this parasite shares morphological similarities in some developmental stages with G. clupearum ( see [ 46 ]).	"Goussia lusca	8	21	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Goussia lusca"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In turn, G. clupearum has been described from several hosts including T. trachurus captured off the Galician coast ( Spain) [ 47 ], and other Trisopterus species ( e. g. off Scotland [ 48 ]).	"Trisopterus	142	153	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Trisopterus"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Despite the considerable morphological variation found in G. clupearum from different hosts ( see [ 46 ]), which could indicate the existence of a species complex, infections by G. clupearum seem to be restricted to host liver.	"infections	164	174	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""infections"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
( 5. 7 – 7. 2 %), the monophyly of the clade was highly supported ( 99% posterior probability and 100 bootstrap support ); for this reason we considered the genotypes recovered from P. caeruleostictus likely to belong to Calyptospora.

Given the phylogenetic affinities of the available sequences attributed to Caryospora cheloniae, ( herein designated as Caryospora cf. cheloniae ), it has been suggested that the taxonomy of this parasite should be redefined and that it should be placed in a different genus [ 29 ].

Although this hypothesis assumes identical rates of gene gain and loss, and our coarse calculations have not considered that new gene duplicates are also the most likely genes to be lost, the consistency of gene number among fully sequenced mammals suggests that this is not an onerous assumption across short evolutionary time periods.

Based on the 9, 990 families inferred to be present in the most recent common ancestor ( MRCA) of mammals, our estimate for the average rate of genomic turnover is 0. 0016 gains and losses per gene per million years.

Along the lineage leading to humans, 414 families have expanded and 86 have contracted ( Table 2 ).	"humans	29	35	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""humans"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
These changes account for the gain of 689 genes and the loss of 86 genes from the human genome.	"human	82	87	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

We find 30 families where the lineage leading to modern humans contains the most significant departure from random gain and loss of genes.	"humans	56	62	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""humans"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The large expansion along the human lineage implies the gain of at least 8 genes in the last six million years.	"human	30	35	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

If large expansions in family size are more likely the result of natural selection than are large contractions [ 23 ], [ 44 ], then our results suggest that many of the significant changes in human are due to adaptive evolution.	"human	192	197	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 192, ""end_span"": 197, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
While this does not mean that any single gene gain or loss has not been driven by natural selection, it does indicate that gene gain may be a likely instrument of adaptation.	"or	51	53	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""or"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
It should be noted, however, that large expansions in the size of gene families could also be due to either increased rates of gene duplication via mutation in individual families, or some form of relaxed selection that allows for increased rates of fixation of duplicate genes.

Previously, such developmental plasticity of phasic inhibition was ascribed to the expression of synaptic GABAARs incorporating the α1 subunit.	"GABAARs	106	113	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GABAARs"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
However, the duration of mIPSCs recorded from L2 / 3 cortical neurons derived from α1 subunit deleted mice, were similarly under the developmental influence of a neurosteroid tone.

During this critical time the duration of synaptic events mediated by GABAARs becomes progressively reduced, permitting postsynaptic neurons to respond to input from certain fast - spiking GABA - ergic interneurons and thereby appropriately influence the temporal window for postsynaptic excitation ( Whittington et al ., 2011, Deidda et al ., 2014, Fritschy and Panzanelli, 2014 ).	"GABAARs	70	77	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GABAARs"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Alterations to the subunit composition of synaptic GABAARs are implicated in producing these crucial changes to inhibitory postsynaptic current ( IPSC) kinetics ( Brickley et al ., 1996, Okada et al ., 2000, Vicini et al ., 2001, Juttner et al ., 2001, Goldstein et al ., 2002, Bosman et al ., 2005; Takahashi, 2005, Fritschy and Panzanelli, 2014, Deidda et al ., 2014 ).	"GABAARs	51	58	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GABAARs"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In the CNS, these GABAAR subtypes exhibit a heterogeneous expression pattern, which importantly in many neurons is known to change during neonatal development ( Olsen and Sieghart, 2008, Fritschy and Panzanelli, 2014, Rudolph and Mohler, 2014 ).	"GABAAR	18	24	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GABAAR"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In particular, an increased expression of receptors incorporating the α1 subunit ( α1 - GABAARs) is implicated in the appearance of short duration IPSCs ( Okada et al ., 2000, Vicini et al ., 2001, Peden et al ., 2008, Eyre et al ., 2012, Deidda et al ., 2014, Fritschy and Panzanelli, 2014 ).

Certain naturally occurring neurosteroids act in a non - genomic manner as endogenous positive allosteric modulators of the GABAAR ( Belelli and Lambert, 2005, Zorumski et al ., 2013 ).

The properties of mIPSCs ( frequency, amplitude and kinetics ), recorded from WT L2 / 3 pyramidal neurons, obtained from neonatal / juvenile ( P7 - 15) to adolescent ( P20 - 24) mice, changed with development ( Fig. 1; Table 1 ).	"mice	178	182	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 178, ""end_span"": 182, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This effect on the mIPSC duration was indistinguishable from that produced by γ - CD ( finasteride τW = 8. 5 ± 0. 3 ms, n = 7, γ - CD τW = 8. 5 ± 0. 2 ms, n = 20; p > 0. 05, one way ANOVA, Fig. 2F, G, Table 1 ).	"finasteride	87	98	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""finasteride"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Collectively, these findings indicate that an endogenous neurosteroid tone influences synaptic GABAARs at P7 – 8.	"GABAARs	95	102	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GABAARs"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
This treatment ( recordings made > 6 min after achieving the whole - cell recording configuration) significantly reduced the mIPSC τW ( control = 12. 1 ± 0. 3 ms, n = 55; γ - CD ICS: 9. 2 ± 0. 6 ms, n = 6, p < 0. 05, one way ANOVA, Fig. 2D, F, G ), an effect indistinguishable from that of γ - CD resulting from the pre - incubation protocol ( γ - CD pre - incubation: 8. 5 ± 0. 2 ms, n = 20, p > 0. 05, one way ANOVA, Fig. 2F, G) and not significantly different from that produced by finasteride ( 50 μM) treatment ( p > 0. 05, one way ANOVA τW = 8. 5 ± 0. 3 ms, n = 7, Fig. 2F, G ).

The neurosteroid interaction with GABAARs may be influenced by factors such as subunit composition and phosphorylation status ( Koksma et al ., 2003, Belelli and Lambert, 2005 ).	"GABAARs	34	41	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GABAARs"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
We therefore investigated whether GABAARs expressed by P20 - 24 L2 / 3 pyramidal neurons retained neurosteroid sensitivity.	"GABAARs	34	41	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GABAARs"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The acute bath application of exogenous 5α3α ( 1 μM, whereby mIPSCs were analysed before, and after ∼ 7 min application of the steroid) resulted in mIPSCs with a significantly prolonged decay phase ( control τW: 5. 5 ± 0. 5 ms vs 1 μM 5α3α τW: 8. 7 ± 1. 7 ms, n = 7, p < 0. 05, paired t - test ).	"steroid	127	134	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""steroid"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
For isolated single cell studies, acutely applied 5α3α acts at nM aqueous concentrations to enhance GABAAR function ( Pistis et al ., 1997, Belelli and Lambert, 2005 ).	"GABAAR	100	106	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GABAAR"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Therefore, the relatively limited effect of acutely applied 5α3α at the relatively high concentration of 1 μM might suggest that these cortical synaptic GABAARs are relatively insensitive to the neurosteroid by P20 - 24.	"GABAARs	153	160	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GABAARs"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 160, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Alternatively, the effect of the steroid when applied acutely to a brain slice may be underestimated.	"steroid	33	40	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""steroid"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Here, pre - incubation of the cortical slice with 5α - DHP ( 3 μM) for > 2 h, followed by continuous perfusion of this steroid during the recording ( see Methods ), resulted in greatly prolonged mIPSCs ( control τW = 5. 4 ± 0. 2 ms, n = 25 vs 5α - DHP τW = 16. 1 ± 0. 6 ms, n = 7, p < 0. 001, one way ANOVA - see Fig. 4B, C ).	"steroid	119	126	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""steroid"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Furthermore, these data provide additional evidence that their synaptic GABAARs remain neurosteroid sensitive.	"GABAARs	72	79	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GABAARs"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Phasic GABAergic transmission of L2 / 3 pyramidal neurons is influenced both by an endogenous neurosteroid tone and by the subunit composition of synaptic GABAARs	"GABAARs	155	162	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GABAARs"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 162, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Despite treatment with γ - CD, the mIPSC decay time still decreased with development, with a similar trend observed for finasteride - treated neurons ( Fig. 3, Table 1 ).	"finasteride	120	131	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""finasteride"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Numerous studies have implicated changes to the subunit composition of synaptic GABAARs to be important in this respect, with a particular emphasis on the role of the α1 subunit ( Rovira and Ben - Ari, 1993, Tia et al ., 1996, Hollrigel and Soltesz, 1997, Dunning et al ., 1999, Kapur and Macdonald, 1999, Vicini, 1999, Vicini et al ., 2001, Okada et al ., 2000, Ortinski et al ., 2004 ).	"GABAARs	80	87	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GABAARs"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
However, in common with WT neurons, the α1 −/− mIPSC decay phase became faster with development ( p < 0. 001, one way ANOVA, Fig. 5; Table 2 ), suggesting that factors other than increased expression of α1 - subunit containing GABAARs must contribute to the developmental profile.	"GABAARs	227	234	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GABAARs"", ""start_span"": 227, ""end_span"": 234, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Co - localization studies revealed that three major interneuron classes present in mouse neocortex, ( i. e.	"mouse	83	88	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
However, the effect of intracellular γ - CD was significantly influenced by developmental stage ( two - way ANOVA, age × treatment interaction, F1, 33 = 16. 23, p < 0. 001 ), such that the mIPSC decay of P20 - 24 interneurons was no longer influenced by the steroid scavenger ( τW control = 4. 5 ± 0. 3 ms, n = 14; ICS γ - CD τW = 4. 0 ± 0. 4, n = 7, p > 0. 05, unpaired t - test, Fig. 7 C, D, E, Table 3 ).	"steroid	258	265	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""steroid"", ""start_span"": 258, ""end_span"": 265, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Furthermore, early in development a neurosteroid tone is experienced by the synaptic GABAARs of both GABA - ergic interneurons and principal neurons, which by P20 - 24 dissipates, resulting in brief phasic inhibitory events.	"GABAARs	85	92	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GABAARs"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
During this period, several mechanisms may contribute to the mIPSC decay time, including: alterations in the subunit composition of synaptic GABAARs ( Takahashi, 2005, Eyre et al ., 2012 ), post - translational modifications of synaptic proteins ( Vithlani et al.	"GABAARs	141	148	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GABAARs"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The latter is influenced by the activity and location of the various GABA transporters.	"GABA transporters	69	86	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GABA transporters"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
However, whereas the effects of transporter inhibitors on the time course of responses to iontophoretically applied GABA, or on IPSCs evoked by repetitive nerve stimulation are quite evident, they have relatively little effect on the amplitude or kinetics of mIPSCs ( Keros and Hablitz, 2005, Scimemi, 2014 ).	"transporter	32	43	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""transporter"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Our results indicate that in addition to a possible involvement of such factors, during postnatal development the mIPSCs of L2 / 3 pyramidal neurons become reduced in duration, at least in part due to a programmed loss of the influence of endogenous neurosteroids upon synaptic GABAARs.	"GABAARs	278	285	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GABAARs"", ""start_span"": 278, ""end_span"": 285, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
A previous study reported that β - CD ( 0. 5 – 1. 5 mM ), when applied to hippocampal neurons prolonged the decay of macroscopic currents mediated by GABAARs ( Pytel et al.	"GABAARs	150	157	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GABAARs"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Theoretically, the loss of neurosteroid influence on phasic inhibition with development may result from the synaptic GABAARs becoming insensitive to this endogenous modulator ( Koksma et al.	"GABAARs	117	124	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GABAARs"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Furthermore by pre - incubating the tissue with a lower, aqueous concentration ( 100 nM) of 5α3α, we demonstrated these synaptic GABAARs to be highly sensitive to the neurosteroid at this stage of development.	"GABAARs	129	136	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GABAARs"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
We previously demonstrated that incubation of mouse thalamic slices with 5α - DHP, the immediate precursor of 5α3α, greatly increased the duration of the mIPSCs of VB neurons ( Brown et al.	"mouse	46	51	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Collectively these results suggest that the developmental change to phasic inhibition of cortical pyramidal neurons occurring between P7 and P20 results in a part from a lack of steroid substrate.	"steroid	178	185	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""steroid"", ""start_span"": 178, ""end_span"": 185, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
However, a recent study identified expression of 5αR Type II in cortical GABAergic cells, suggesting that neurosteroid synthesis and action may not always be confined to principal excitatory neurons ( Castelli et al.	"5αR Type II	49	60	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""5\u03b1R Type II"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Whether cortical principal cells or interneuron populations are the locus of neurosteroid synthesis is not directly addressed by our finasteride, or intracellular γ - CD experiments.	"finasteride	133	144	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""finasteride"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
If at P7 - 8 the mode of neurosteroid action is exclusively autocrine, then a ubiquitous expression of steroid - synthesizing enzymes across different neuronal populations would be required.	"steroid	30	37	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""steroid"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Alternatively, the local steroid concentration present during neonatal development may be sufficient to impact upon GABA - ergic and / or principal neurons, which are incapable of neurosteroid synthesis, thereby inferring a paracrine mode of action.	"steroid	25	32	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""steroid"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

However, a comparison of the mIPSC decay of P7 - 8 and P20 - 24 α1 −/− neurons, when treated with either finasteride, or γ - CD, reveals an additional, as yet unidentified factor ( s) that influences phasic GABAergic neurotransmission during postnatal development.

This study focused on L2 / 3 cortical neurons and found that the synaptic GABAARs expressed on both pyramidal and interneuron populations are developmentally influenced by neurosteroids to modulate the duration of GABAergic synaptic transmission.

Some staff outside the VA - DPP team perceived VA - DPP as a competitor to MOVE! and questioned whether a new program was necessary ( Negative Compatibility, Negative Relative Advantage ). If people are prediabetic, losing weight will help decrease their risk of becoming diabetic, so MOVE! in and of itself could serve as a Diabetes Prevention Program, although it ’ s not called that ( MOVE!

Number of referrals was lower during the demonstration period than in the years leading up to the demonstration, perhaps because of other organizational priorities during that time ( e. g ., implementation of PCMH during the demonstration) and there was an unexpectedly high prevalence of patients who already progressed to diabetes, especially compared to the general VHA patient population ( 43 vs. 25 %, respectively) [ 34 ].

Being able to identify which individual patient is most likely to respond well to treatment with placebo or tadalafil, rather than just knowing its average benefit to a subgroup of patients, would be clinically useful and consistent with the growing trend towards more patient - tailored treatment [ 15 ].

Identifying predictors of response to drug therapy can be beneficial, especially where significant improvements in patient health - related QoL are sought, such as in LUTS - BPH where symptom relief is the primary goal of treatment for the majority of men.	"BPH	174	177	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""BPH"", ""start_span"": 174, ""end_span"": 177, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first clinical data mining analysis to use mathematical modelling in studies of patients with LUTS - BPH.	"BPH	143	146	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""BPH"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Similarly, we found no characteristics that determined response to LUTS - BPH treatment when placebo is used.	"BPH	74	77	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""BPH"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Subsequent analyses revealed improvement in both IPSS storage and voiding subscores [ 12 ], and that improvements in LUTS occurred irrespective of the presence of co - existing ED [ 37 ].

Many examples exist in the literature of predictors of response ( or failure to respond) to drug therapy that include the use of drugs for LUTS - BPH.	"BPH	146	149	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""BPH"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
For example, large prostate volume and more severe symptoms at baseline have been identified as predictive factors for failure to respond to first - line medical therapy for LUTS - BPH [ 39 ].	"BPH	181	184	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""BPH"", ""start_span"": 181, ""end_span"": 184, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
There were also limitations inherent in the trial inclusion and exclusion criteria; for example, patients with post - void residual urine volume > 300ml were excluded and prostate volume was not directly assessed, although PSA can be used as a surrogate for prostate size.

During these growth experiments, soluble sulfate concentrations remained the same or decreased slightly ( data not shown ), indicating that energy was gained from the oxidation of compounds other than any trace RISCs in the yeast extract, most probably organic carbon.

Indeed, enzymes involved in glyoxylate metabolism were more abundant in the presence of arsenic, suggesting that expression of such proteins is regulated in response to arsenic in both strains.

Two groups could be distinguished within the Thiomonas strains studied: Group I comprises all the strains in this study except T. arsenivorans, which is part of a second group, Group II.	"Thiomonas	45	54	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Thiomonas"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This suggests that lithotrophy is a general characteristic of the Thiomonas genus.	"Thiomonas	66	75	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Thiomonas"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In contrast, neither strain Ynys1 nor T. perometabolis could grow organotrophically in the absence of a reduced sulfur compound, suggesting that, despite previous findings, facultative organotrophy is not a general property of the Thiomonas genus.

To improve our understanding of these important arsenic - resistant bacteria, several metabolic and genetic properties were investigated.	"arsenic - resistant bacteria	48	76	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""arsenic - resistant bacteria"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
It appears that much greater physiological differentiation regarding arsenic response was possible between these Thiomonas strains than may have been previously suggested.	"Thiomonas	113	122	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Thiomonas"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This may indicate a potential energetic role of the element for these strains, as proposed for the arsenic - oxidising bacterium, H. arsenicoxydans [ 25 ].	"arsenic - oxidising bacterium	99	128	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""arsenic - oxidising bacterium"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Indeed, these two strains are unable to oxidize As ( III ), probably as they lack aox genes.	"aox	82	85	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aox"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Moreover, arsB2 genes were not detected in Ynys1 and T. perometabolis.	"arsB2	10	15	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""arsB2"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Interestingly, WJ68 was found to be equally resistant to arsenic as these strains, yet no arsB2 gene could be amplified by PCR.	"arsB2	90	95	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""arsB2"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Alternatively, the higher resistance capacities of T. arsenivorans, Thiomonas sp.	"Thiomonas	68	77	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Thiomonas"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Thus it appears that while there may be a common arsenic response between all the bacteria, the general metabolism may be differentially adapted to each environment from which these strains originated.	"bacteria	82	90	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bacteria"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Thiomonas arsenivorans can grow autotrophically using either As ( III) or thiosulfate as the sole energy source.	"Thiomonas arsenivorans	0	22	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Thiomonas arsenivorans"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Surprisingly, the differential protein expression analysis revealed that even in the presence of yeast extract, proteins involved in CO2 fixation through the Calvin - Benson - Bassham cycle and enzymes involved in the glycolysis / neoglucogenesis were expressed.	"yeast	97	102	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""yeast"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This suggests that an increase in cbb genes expression in the presence of arsenic improves its capacity to fix CO2.	"cbb	34	37	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cbb"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
On the other hand, the opposite observation was seen with Thiomonas sp.	"Thiomonas	58	67	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Thiomonas"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Therefore, the proteomic results obtained from the present study suggest that these two Thiomonas strains react differently to their arsenic - contaminated environments.

( 2017) demonstrated that there is no codependence of the deposition of pigment and cuticle, the preserved pigments in the oviraptorid eggshell could derive from the eggshell or the preserved cuticle layer and in the latter instance would be indicative of cuticle preservation.

The Triprismatoolithus stephensi eggshells ( MOR ES101 ), probably attributable to alvarezsaurids ( Agnolin et al ., 2012; Varricchio & Jackson, 2016 ), were collected as isolated shell fragments in the lower portion of the Two Medicine Formation in the Sevenmile Hill outcrops, Teton County, Montana, USA ( Table 1 ).

For the first round, Raman Analysis I ( referred hereafter as RI ), we analyzed the domestic chicken eggshell from a commercial source with a WITec Alpha300 system with 532 nm wavelength laser light and a confocal 50 × objective, each for 20 s.	"chicken	93	100	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""chicken"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Since the cuticle on the chicken eggshell was easily identified with the naked eye, as well as under the SEM ( Figs. 1C and 1D ), the first round confirmed the detectability by Raman spectroscopy of the HAp of the cuticle layer ( Figs.	"chicken	25	32	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""chicken"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

Of the of total 30 line mappings on the three Macroolithus yaotunensis eggshell, only two of them, which were from the Jiangxi and Guangdong specimens, show a significant phosphorus peak on the boundary between the eggshell and surrounding sediment ( Figs.

In addition, the P concentration increases from the mammillary layer to the prismatic layer in all analyzed oviraptorid eggshells ( Figs.	"oviraptorid	108	119	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""oviraptorid"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

Therefore, the peak in the sediment surrounding the Triprismatoolithus stephensi eggshell might be derived from the eggshell specimen itself.

The enigmatic fiber - like structure near the base of the mammillary layer in the Triprismatoolithus eggshell ( Fig. 4D) may be a capillary vessel of the chorioallantoic membrane or a fiber of the membrana testacea.

However, the fiber - like structure in the Triprismatoolithus eggshell does not appear to be hollow, unlike a blood vessel ( Schweitzer et al ., 2005 ).

In Gallus gallus domesticus eggshells, a pattern of increasing P concentration from the mammillary layer to the prismatic layer has been reported ( Cusack, Fraser & Stachel, 2003 ).	"Gallus gallus domesticus	3	27	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Gallus gallus domesticus"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This pattern is similar to what we observed in oviraptorid eggshells ( Figs.	"oviraptorid	47	58	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""oviraptorid"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
On the other hand, in the Triprismatoolithus stephensi eggshell, P concentration varies slightly between the mammillary and prismatic layer but decreases significantly from the prismatic layer to the external layer ( Fig. 4E ).	"Triprismatoolithus stephensi	26	54	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Triprismatoolithus stephensi"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Based on the general deficiency of P in the surrounding sediment, we posit that the P peak in the sediment surrounding the Triprismatoolithus stephensi eggshell is a result of a detached cuticle layer.

If the sequestration of P is a crucial factor in the termination of calcite growth, the high concentration of P on the boundary between the prismatic and external layers represents a possible temporal hiatus between the prismatic and external layers in the Triprismatoolithus eggshell.

In the Raman study of the fossil eggshells, the peak at 967 cm − 1 of Gallus eggshell was not seen in all spectra, but a broad peak ranging from 972 – 986 cm − 1 was detected instead ( Fig. 2A ).

Whitlockite is the second most abundant mineral in biological calcified tissues, accounting for around 20% of bone mineral ( Driessens & Verbeeck, 1990; Jang et al ., 2014; Jang et al ., 2015 ).

It is also possible that the HAp of the inner cuticle layer is in a non - stoichiometric form, and hence part of the phosphate anion (\ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal} \ usepackage { amsmath} \ usepackage { wasysym} \ usepackage { amsfonts} \ usepackage { amssymb} \ usepackage { amsbsy} \ usepackage { upgreek} \ usepackage { mathrsfs} \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{- 69pt} \ begin { document} }{}${\ mathrm { PO }} _ { 4 }^{ 3 -}$\ end { document} PO43 −) is occupied by hydrogen phosphate \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal} \ usepackage { amsmath} \ usepackage { wasysym} \ usepackage { amsfonts} \ usepackage { amssymb} \ usepackage { amsbsy} \ usepackage { upgreek} \ usepackage { mathrsfs} \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{- 69pt} \ begin { document} }{}$({\ mathrm { HPO }} _ { 4 }^{ 2 -})$\ end { document} HPO42 − ( Rey et al ., 2011; De La Pierre et al ., 2014 ).

Although Wilson et al. ( 2017) indicated that pigment deposition and cuticle formation are not codependent, the preserved protoporphyrin pigments was probably from the cuticle layer.

This indicates that, in addition to intact RRMs, the C - terminal region adjacent to the second RRM is essential for the Spo5 function.	"Spo5	121	125	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Spo5"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

To clarify whether RNA - binding is required for Spo5 localization and function, we introduced missense mutations to the conserved motifs in RRMs.	"Spo5	49	53	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Spo5"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Similar, or slightly lower production of Spo5 ( F341A, F427A) protein compared to the wild - type was confirmed ( Additional file 1: Figure S1 ).	"Spo5	41	45	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Spo5"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Our precise analysis suggested that Spo5 ( F341A, F427A) protein might exhibit punctate cytoplasmic distribution during early meiotic stages such as the horsetail - movement and one - nucleus stages ( Additional file 2: Figure S2 ).	"Spo5	36	40	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Spo5"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Because aromatic residues in the RRM, such as F341, have been shown to interact directly with RNA [ 22 ], we speculated that the RNA - binding of Spo5 might be important for its cytoplasmic localization.	"Spo5	146	150	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Spo5"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Spo5 localizes to the cytoplasm via the mRNA export pathway	"Spo5	0	4	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Spo5"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
RRMs appear to be essential for the translocation of Spo5 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.	"Spo5	53	57	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Spo5"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
This suggests that Spo5 is likely to be exported to the cytoplasm via the mRNA export machinery.	"Spo5	19	23	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Spo5"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Consistent with this idea, Spo5 accumulated in the nucleus when mRNA synthesis was inhibited by the addition of 1, 10 - phenanthroline ( Figure 2B, C ).	"Spo5	27	31	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Spo5"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Spo5 localization to the cytoplasm facilitated by the mRNA export pathway does not involve global mRNA export.	"Spo5	0	4	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Spo5"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

Taken together, we conclude that Spo5 is exported to the cytoplasm via the mRNA export machinery, but is unlikely to be involved in global mRNA export.	"Spo5	33	37	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Spo5"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Some RNA - binding proteins are also known to be exported to the cytoplasm through binding to mRNAs [ 31 - 33 ].	"RNA - binding proteins	5	27	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RNA - binding proteins"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Nuclear export is important for the function of Spo5	"Spo5	48	52	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Spo5"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The findings of this study indicated that mutations in RRMs caused abnormal nuclear accumulation and loss of function of Spo5.	"Spo5	121	125	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Spo5"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Hence, we employed two approaches to investigate whether the nuclear export of Spo5 is a fundamental requirement for its function.	"Spo5	79	83	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Spo5"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
First, we used an external nuclear localization signal ( NLS) to alter the localization of Spo5 artificially from the cytoplasm to the nucleus.	"Spo5	91	95	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Spo5"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

The fusion of a nuclear export signal ( NES) to Spo5RRM1 ∆ ( Spo5RRM1 ∆ – NES – GFP) enhanced its localization to the cytoplasm ( Figure 3D ).	"GFP	80	83	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GFP"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Therefore, we screened for multi - copy suppressors of spo5 ( S365P ), expecting to identify novel candidates.	"spo5	55	59	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""spo5"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
We introduced the cDNA library to the spo5 ( S365P) mutant and picked up iodine - positive colonies.	"spo5	38	42	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""spo5"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

Meiosis and sporulation were induced in cells harboring pPEP1 ( vector) or pPEP3 - pcr1 +, and the sporulation efficiency was calculated ( n > 500 ).	"pcr1	83	87	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""pcr1"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
We also confirmed that Spo5C carrying the F341A and F427A mutations, designated Spo5C ( FAFA ), lost the binding ability to pcr1 + RNA ( Figure 5D, compare lanes 2 vs. 7, and lanes 3 vs. 8 ), demonstrating the importance of the RRMs for the binding.

A previous report suggested that a long 3 ′ UTR of cdc13 +, cdc25 + and ste9 + mRNA might determine its stability [ 38 ].	"cdc13	51	56	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cdc13"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The binding of Spo5 to mRNAs through its two RRMs appears to enable its nuclear export, and this RNA - binding activity is essential not only for the nuclear export, but also for its function in the cytoplasm.	"Spo5	15	19	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Spo5"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Spo5 is unlikely to be involved in general mRNA export, suggesting that it may instead be involved in the post - transcriptional regulation occurring in the cytoplasm, such as control of mRNA stability and / or translational initiation.

As the antioxidant genes were up - regulated in the overexpressing lines but down - regulated in the RNAi lines, we speculate that the antioxidant genes may be regulated by CsbHLH18.

However, relatively little is known about the role of bHLH proteins in stress response when compared with the abundant information garnered from other families of TFs ( Huang et al ., 2013 ).

A genome - wide exploration of bHLH proteins in any species, and functional characterization of some of the family members, can therefore provide a better understanding of this TF family in stress signaling pathways.

Currently, ~ 87% of the sweet orange genome has been published; therefore, it is possible that availability of a more detailed genome sequence in the future may help to locate the four genes in the exact chromosomes.

Alignment of all the bHLH domains, which are necessary for the formation of homodimers or heterodimers, showed that the Leu - 24 and Leu - 56 residues in the helix regions were completely conserved, compared with 99% and 97% in tomato ( Sun et al ., 2015 ).	"tomato	228	234	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""tomato"", ""start_span"": 228, ""end_span"": 234, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Dimerization could involve interactions between the bHLH proteins themselves, but also between bHLH proteins and other TFs.	"TFs	119	122	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TFs"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
These results suggest that CsbHLH18 is a positive regulator of the tolerance to cold stress.	"CsbHLH18	27	35	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CsbHLH18"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Hence, our findings provide a new avenue to understand the implication of bHLH18 in cold tolerance and offer a new candidate gene with potential for genetic engineering in an effort to improve abiotic stress tolerance.

Cold stress leads to a plethora of physiological effects that may be detrimental to plant cells, one of which is accumulation of ROS that are toxic molecules causing oxidative damages to cellular components, including proteins, lipids, and DNA ( Miller et al ., 2010 ).	"plant	84	89	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""plant"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
ROS may be maintained at a low level under favorable growth conditions, but are dramatically elevated when plants are challenged by abiotic stresses, leading to ROS - associated injuries.	"plants	107	113	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""plants"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Under this scenario, the ROS level is always used for examining the difference in stress tolerance capacity between various plants.	"plants	124	130	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""plants"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Of note, the lower ROS levels in the transgenic lines are consistent with their better growth phenotype and less serious membrane damage ( indicated by lower EL ), implying that accumulation of lower ROS levels constitutes a physiological mechanism partly, if not fully, underlying CsbHLH18 - mediated cold tolerance in the transgenic lines.	"CsbHLH18	282	290	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CsbHLH18"", ""start_span"": 282, ""end_span"": 290, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Herein, the transgenic lines displayed significantly higher antioxidant enzyme activities than the WT under cold conditions, indicating that the transgenic plants may have a more powerful ROS - scavenging machinery.	"plants	156	162	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""plants"", ""start_span"": 156, ""end_span"": 162, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We thus hypothesize that bHLH18 functions in cold tolerance by controlling ROS accumulation via modulation of the antioxidant - scavenging machinery.	"bHLH18	25	31	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bHLH18"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In the present study, the fact that the three antioxidant genes were noticeably up - regulated in the overexpressing lines but down - regulated in the RNAi lines seems to suggest that they may serve as targets of CsbHLH18.

One of the reasons for this phenomenon is the difference in the nucleotides surrounding the E - box elements, which has been reported to influence the three - dimensional structure of DNA - binding sites ( Gordân et al ., 2013 ).	"nucleotides	64	75	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""nucleotides"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

CsbHLH18 - mediated cold tolerance might be due, at least in part, to modulation of the antioxidant system by regulating, directly or indirectly, the antioxidant genes.	"CsbHLH18	0	8	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CsbHLH18"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

Here, we establish a novel model of tendon regeneration using neonatal mice and show that neonates heal via formation of a ‘ neo - tendon ’ that differentiates along the tendon specific lineage with functional restoration of gait and mechanical properties.

With acute injury or tendinopathy, tendon function is often permanently compromised due to poor healing and scarring ( defined as disorganized fibrovascular matrix and inferior mechanical properties ), leading to chronic pain and prolonged disability1.

Using genetic tools, we further show that tendon regeneration is driven by two cell populations: 1) an early population of extrinsic αSMA cells that are transiently recruited and 2) intrinsic tenocytes that proliferate and differentiate to regenerate the tendon.

Note that no differences were ever detected between left and right hindlimbs of non - injured, age - matched control mice at any timepoint ( p > 0. 1; Supplementary Fig.	"mice	117	121	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

Consistent with the TEM results, the green color for injured tendon indicated abundance of smaller collagen fibrils compared to the orange / red color indicating larger diameter fibrils in the contralateral control ( Fig. 4E ).

The sustained presence of type III collagen has also been previously reported in studies of adult tendon injury.	"type III collagen	26	43	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""type III collagen"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
We therefore immunostained for type III collagen at d56, however comparable staining was observed between control and injured tendons in the neonatal group ( Fig. 4F ).	"type III collagen	31	48	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""type III collagen"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Overall, these results indicate that neonatal tendon structure is more organized after injury compared to adults, with larger collagen fibrils.	"collagen	126	134	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""collagen"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
However, despite improved organization, the collagen matrix ultrastructure in the neonatal group remained immature 56 days after injury, indicating some structural limitations to neonatal regeneration.

At d14 and d28 after neonatal injury, analysis of whole mount limbs and transverse sections showed that the ScxGFP + neo - tendon was strongly composed of RosaT + cells, suggesting that the neo - tendon is derived from Scx - lineage ( Scxlin) tenoyctes that are recruited from the original tendon stubs ( Fig. 8B, C ).	"Scx	108	111	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Scx"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Collectively, our results suggest that neonatal healing is mediated by transient infiltration of αSMA + cells, followed by proliferation and recruitment of intrinsic Scxlin tenocytes.	"αSMA	97	101	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""\u03b1SMA"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In contrast, adult tenocytes are quiescent after injury and do not undergo recruitment; in the absence of tenogenic cells, adult fibrotic healing is mediated by αSMA - expressing cells that persist to form a permanent scar ( Fig. 10 ).	"αSMA	161	165	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""\u03b1SMA"", ""start_span"": 161, ""end_span"": 165, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
For example, in the case of regenerative organisms ( such as adult salamanders) or tissues ( such as bone ), it can be argued that the regenerative process recapitulates aspects of development during the course of healing2324.	"salamanders	67	78	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""salamanders"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

Furthermore, structures involved in mating are generally species - specific ( which is the case in Scissicauda) and evolve fast ( Eberhard 2004 ), often as a consequence of sexual selection ( Hosken and Stockley 2004 ), and may promote reproductive isolation either by structural or sensory lock - and - key, thus avoiding hybridization ( Masly 2012 ).

Since rural Indians tend to have lower BMI than rural Melanesians, and in turn urban residents of both ethnicities, the Axis 2 association with Lifestyle may be in part due to the effect of obesity on this axis of gene expression.

Nevertheless, people with similar body weights also differ with respect to their position along the axis, as can be seen in Figure 6, and future studies will investigate whether and how this influences the onset of metabolic syndrome diseases.

An alternative possibility is that Melanesians may have evolved genetic divergence with respect to regulation of Axis 2 as a result of historical body weight patterns related to fertility - associated fattening rituals ( Pollock, 1995 ), though this is unlikely since the high levels of obesity present on the islands are thought to be a post - World War II phenomenon ( Hodge et al ., 1992 ).

The notion of a fully continuous β - phase network has recently been called into question when observing the grain boundaries in AA5083 via Ga - embrittled intergranular fracture surfaces, where a continuous β - phase is not observed at the grain boundaries.

A salient point is that the imaging herein is pseudo 3D, in that a grain boundary area is studied, as opposed to the cross - sectional view employed in TEM analysis.

At this relatively severe level of sensitisation, an near continuous β phase decoration of the grain boundary is observed in Fig. 4a, however the HR - SEM image ( Fig. 4b) shows that it is not completely continuous.

In addition, by assuming the rugged surface captured by SEM is flat, a certain level of stereological error in the number density is inevitable.

It is worth noting that the assumption of a constant average NND in AA5083 is consistent with site - saturated nucleation of the β - phase, which has been proposed previously based on JMAK modelling29, 30.

The dotted line for JMAK 40 ° C ~ 100 ° C represents estimated DoS of sensitised AA5083 - H116 from a the JMAK model presented in ref. 29, whilst the JMAK 150 ° C and 200 ° C lines are calculated according to the values in Fig. 11.

Adding the 150 ° C and 200 ° C DoS series to prior data provided in ref. 26, it is clear that AA5083 - H131 experiences a marked shift in kinetics above 100 ° C ( Fig. 11 ).

The change in kinetics at higher temperatures could arise from a number of different sources; including the decrease in the driving force present to nucleate the β - phase, and the increased likelihood of Mg content forming intragranular precipitates 26.

A JMAK model, with the high temperature expansion presented, was able to predict the overall kinetics of AA5083 - H131 sensitisation, though it remains unable to account for variations in the sensitisation plateau values observed between all reported studies ( e. g. sensitisation studies 100 ° C) using only literature averaged scaling factors.

In a general sense, the texture1, 42, grain size, and level of cold work of specimens will also influence the DoS for sensitised AA5083, however such parameters are not presently discussed and will be considered in future iterations for the modelling of grain boundary precipitation of β - phase.

Given the frequent disconnect between pathology in the retina versus targets in the brain, we sought to identify any relationships in cytokine levels between these two structures.

Inner and outer plexiform layers are most densely stained for FGF - 2, with diffuse staining throughout other layers of the retina.	"FGF - 2	62	69	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FGF - 2"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
This also suggests that glia and other cell types constitute the majority of FGF - 2 production in the retina.	"FGF - 2	77	84	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FGF - 2"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Müller glia are likely a major producer of FGF - 2 as reported by Hageman and colleagues [ 30] and others ( refer to [ 31, 32 ]).	"FGF - 2	43	50	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FGF - 2"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
This disparity between locations of the stressor and manifestation of pathology is commonly seen in neurodegenerative disorders [ 34 ].

Despite this pattern of progression, a comprehensive description of cytokine profiles throughout this projection apart from retina and optic nerve head has not been done.	"cytokine	68	76	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cytokine"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Our work provides an age - dependent analysis of cytokine levels throughout the entire retinal projection of the glaucomatous DBA / 2J model with respect to functional outcome.

Therefore, while FGF - 2 levels may become deregulated between the retina and SC as a feature of normal aging, it is likely that the actual magnitude of concentrations and not the relative values between structures are the important factor in DBA / 2J pathology.	"FGF - 2	17	24	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FGF - 2"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Immunostaining in the retina also supported multiplex FGF - 2 data overall, showing an increase in the DBA / 2J retina compared to D2G controls.	"FGF - 2	54	61	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FGF - 2"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
It is noteworthy that FGF - 2 expression was apparent in several layers, specifically the outer and inner plexiform layers of the retina and not just in ganglion cells; this is relevant since the whole retina was analyzed in the multiplexing experiments.	"FGF - 2	22	29	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FGF - 2"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
FGF - 2 is produced by a variety of cell types including Müller glia, RGCs, and other cell types [ 30, 31 ].	"FGF - 2	0	7	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FGF - 2"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Furthermore, FGF - 2 stimulates Müller cell proliferation [ 32 ].	"FGF - 2	13	20	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FGF - 2"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
This was corroborated by the finding that DBA / 2J mice lacked this response as they aged.	"DBA / 2J mice	42	55	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""DBA / 2J mice"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

Largely, changes in cytokine levels were independent of axonal transport outcome in the SC as well as in the corresponding retina.	"cytokine	20	28	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cytokine"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The chronic degeneration in DBA / 2J mice, however, presents a more complicated scenario.	"DBA / 2J mice	28	41	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""DBA / 2J mice"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Given that we do not see extensive axon injury until then [ 4, 7, 8, 28 ], elevation of IL - 6 within the D12 - 15 SC suggests that this signaling may be a neuroprotective mechanism attempting to salvage or replace lost connections [ 44 ].	"IL - 6	88	94	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 6"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Additionally, differences in cytokine levels, either age - related or strain - related, are compartmentalized throughout the RGC projection.	"cytokine	29	37	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cytokine"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Our data suggest that changes in cytokine and growth factor levels may occur prior to functional transport loss and are consistent with previous work showing inflammatory changes and immune - mediated vasoconstriction early in glaucomatous pathology [ 25 ].	"cytokine	33	41	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cytokine"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
This group also demonstrated that levels of IL - 6 were positively correlated with neurofibrillary tangles [ 45 ].	"IL - 6	44	50	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 6"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Thus, IL - 6 elevations in the SC may be closely coupled to structural demise and axonal loss, as previous work from our lab has shown that both retrograde transport deficits and structural loss are characteristic of the 12 – 15 - month DBA / 2J group [ 7 ].

Numerous studies have proven this impressively, even in chronically ill, functionally impaired, or very old adults [ 1 ].	"chronically ill	56	71	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""chronically ill"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Furthermore, physical activity levels are even lower among persons affected by chronic diseases or functional limitations [ 6, 7 ].	"chronic diseases	79	95	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""chronic diseases"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In order to derive reasonable health promotion and intervention strategies, it is important to better understand the physical activity behavior of older adults, and particularly those being chronically ill and functionally impaired.

Consequently, the aim of the present study was to analyze diurnal profiles of physical activity for community - dwelling, chronically ill and mobility - limited adults aged 70 years and over, and to explore the moderating effect of sex, age, morbidity, mobility limitation, and season on physical activity in the course of the day.

Rats with impaired DA transmission reallocate their instrumental behavior away from food - reinforced tasks with high response requirements, and instead select less effortful food - seeking behaviors.

In contrast, the adenosine A2A antagonist MSX - 3 increased lever presses and highest ratio achieved, but decreased chow consumption.	"adenosine A2A	17	30	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""adenosine A2A"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The cannabinoid CB1 inverse agonist and putative appetite suppressant AM251 decreased lever presses, highest ratio achieved, and chow intake; this effect was similar to that produced by pre - feeding.

Furthermore, DA - related signal transduction activity ( pDARPP - 32 ( Thr34) expression) was greater in nucleus accumbens core of high responders ( rats with high lever pressing output) compared to low responders.

Brain dopamine ( DA ), particularly in nucleus accumbens, plays an important role in regulating aspects of instrumental behavior [ 1 ]–[ 4 ].	"dopamine	6	14	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dopamine"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Rats with accumbens DA depletions are very sensitive to ratio requirements in operant schedules [ 15 ]–[ 17 ].	"Rats	0	4	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Rats"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
T - maze and lever pressing versions of effort discounting procedures also have demonstrated that DA antagonism shifts choice behavior of rats towards low effort alternatives [ 23 ], [ 24 ].	"rats	138	142	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""rats"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Under baseline conditions, rats tested with this procedure typically obtain most of their food by lever pressing while consuming very little of the chow.	"rats	27	31	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""rats"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In addition to accumbens DA, there is a body of research implicating adenosine in behavioral activation and effort - related processes [ 32 ]-[ 34 ].	"adenosine	69	78	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""adenosine"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Adenosine A2A receptors are primarily localized in striatal areas, including both neostriatum and accumbens [ 35 ], [ 36 ].	"Adenosine A2A receptors	0	23	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Adenosine A2A receptors"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In contrast, adenosine A2A antagonists have been shown to increase fixed interval response rate [ 40 ].	"adenosine A2A	13	26	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""adenosine A2A"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Similar to the FR5 / chow feeding choice task, rats tested with this PROG / chow feeding procedure have the choice of pressing the lever reinforced by presentation of the more preferred pellets vs. approaching and consuming the less preferred chow; the difference is that a PROG schedule, which gradually increases the ratio requirement, is used instead of an FR5.

This variant of the choice procedure was used because the PROG schedule requires that the animal repeatedly make within - session choices between lever pressing and chow intake under conditions in which the ratio requirement was gradually incrementing.

Haloperidol produced no significant effects on chow consumption in the dose range tested ( figure 1D ).	"Haloperidol	0	11	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Haloperidol"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
On measures of lever pressing, mean (± SEM) total lever presses ( A ), maximum ratio achieved ( B ), and active lever time ( measured in seconds, C ), haloperidol significantly decreased at the highest dose of 0. 1 mg / kg.

Performance on the PROG / chow feeding choice task was highly variable; some rats lever pressed fewer than 100 times and had high levels of chow intake, while others lever pressed more than 1000 times and consumed small amounts of chow.

Although the repeated measures ANOVA demonstrated that both low and high responders showed significant decreases in number of lever presses ( low responders: F ( 3, 45) = 2. 790, p < 0. 05; high responders: F ( 3, 45) = 4. 638, p < 0. 05 ), analysis of effect sizes showed that the suppressive effect of haloperidol on number of lever presses was greater in high responders ( eta2 = 0. 236) than low responders ( eta2 = 0. 157 ).	"haloperidol	304	315	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""haloperidol"", ""start_span"": 304, ""end_span"": 315, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
These findings are consistent with previous studies showing the ability of DA antagonists or accumbens DA depletions to reduce food - reinforced lever pressing in animals responding on the concurrent FR5 / choice task [ 6 ], [ 25 ], [ 30 ], as well as conventional operant schedules, including various versions of the progressive ratio schedule [ 52 ], [ 53 ].	"animals	163	170	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 163, ""end_span"": 170, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Nevertheless, unlike the previous experiments using the FR5 / chow choice task [ 6 ], [ 25 ], [ 30 ], haloperidol did not produce an overall significant increase in chow intake.	"haloperidol	102	113	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""haloperidol"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
For example, Randall et al. [ 50] demonstrated that food - restricted rats in a free feeding study consume approximately 8 grams of chow in a 30 - minute period.	"rats	70	74	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""rats"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Thus, with the PROG / chow choice procedure, it is difficult to observe drug - induced increases in chow intake in animals that are already eating chow at maximal or near maximal levels.	"animals	115	122	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This is consistent with previous work showing that adenosine A2A antagonists have stimulant - like properties.	"adenosine A2A	51	64	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""adenosine A2A"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Interestingly, although MSX - 3 and haloperidol produced opposite effects on measures of PROG lever pressing and chow intake, in both experiments, the reciprocal relation between lever pressing and chow intake was preserved, as indicated by the high negative correlations between lever pressing and chow intake across all treatments (− 0. 76 and − 0. 78 ).	"haloperidol	36	47	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""haloperidol"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Significant negative partial correlations also were observed in the haloperidol and MSX - 3 experiments when partial correlations were used to control for between - subject variability in lever pressing.	"haloperidol	68	79	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""haloperidol"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Experiment 3 was conducted to determine the effect of appetite - related manipulations on PROG / chow feeding choice performance, in order to provide a contrast with the effects of haloperidol.	"haloperidol	181	192	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""haloperidol"", ""start_span"": 181, ""end_span"": 192, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Two different appetite manipulations were employed: pre - feeding, and administration of a cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist / inverse agonist.	"CB1 receptor	103	115	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CB1 receptor"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Pre - feeding animals prior to their test session, which was used to reduce food motivation and thereby devalue the food reinforcement [ 15 ], [ 54 ], produced marked decreases in number of lever presses and highest ratio achieved.	"animals	14	21	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
But, unlike the effects of haloperidol, pre - feeding also substantially reduced chow consumption.	"haloperidol	27	38	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""haloperidol"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In experiment 3b, the CB1 receptor antagonist / inverse agonist AM251 was assessed.	"CB1 receptor	22	34	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CB1 receptor"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Thus, the pattern of effects on lever pressing and chow intake produced by pre - feeding and AM251 differed markedly from those produced by haloperidol.	"haloperidol	140	151	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""haloperidol"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Moreover, while there was a high inverse correlation between lever pressing and chow intake in the haloperidol experiment, there were no significant correlations or partial correlations between these measures in the pre - feeding and AM251 experiments.	"haloperidol	99	110	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""haloperidol"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
This analysis shows that the inverse relation between lever pressing and chow intake, which is evident under baseline conditions and also throughout the haloperidol experiment, is not shown when primary food motivation is reduced by pre - feeding or drugs, because appetite - suppressant manipulations decrease both food reinforced lever pressing and chow consumption [ 25 ], [ 30 ].	"haloperidol	153	164	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""haloperidol"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 164, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Taken together, experiments 1 – 3 demonstrate that it is exceedingly unlikely that haloperidol is decreasing PROG lever pressing because of a reduction in primary food motivation, appetite, or the unconditioned reinforcing properties of food.	"haloperidol	83	94	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""haloperidol"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
While some rats lever pressed relatively little and had high levels of chow intake, others lever pressed much more and ate relatively little chow.	"rats	11	15	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""rats"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The entire group of animals was divided in two by a median split based upon numbers of lever presses, and pDARPP - 32 ( Thr34) expression was determined.	"animals	20	27	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Recently, Segovia et al. [ 44] reported that pDARPP - 32 ( Thr34) expression in accumbens shell and core was increased in animals undergoing FR5 operant training.	"animals	122	129	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Although several neurochemical factors can influence pDARPP - 32 ( Thr34) production [ 48 ], it is reasonable to suggest that the higher level of pDARPP - 32 ( Thr34) expression in high responders relative to low responders could reflect greater DA release in the animals working harder on the lever pressing component of the task [ 44 ], [ 64 ].	"animals	264	271	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 264, ""end_span"": 271, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
If so, this could indicate that individual differences in work output are related to individual differences in DA transmission in striatal areas, as recently shown in a human imaging study [ 65 ].	"human	169	174	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In summary, the DA antagonist haloperidol reduced the number of lever presses and highest ratio achieved but did not suppress chow intake.	"haloperidol	30	41	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""haloperidol"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In contrast, the adenosine A2A antagonist MSX - 3 increased lever presses and highest ratio achieved, but decreased chow consumption.	"adenosine A2A	17	30	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""adenosine A2A"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Pre - feeding and administration of the cannabinoid CB1 antagonist / inverse agonist AM251 decreased lever presses, highest ratio achieved, and chow intake.	"CB1	52	55	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CB1"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Including the option of having chow concurrently available allows one to conclude that the effects of DA antagonism differed greatly from those produced by pre - feeding or decreases in CB1 transmission, despite the fact that all three manipulations decreased lever pressing.	"CB1	186	189	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CB1"", ""start_span"": 186, ""end_span"": 189, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Thus, haloperidol is not reducing PROG responding because of a general reduction in primary food motivation or the valuation of food reinforcement.	"haloperidol	6	17	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""haloperidol"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Instead, the present data are consistent with the hypothesis that haloperidol left aspects of food motivation intact, but reduced the tendency to work for food reinforcement.	"haloperidol	66	77	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""haloperidol"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Furthermore, DA - related signal transduction activity ( pDARPP - 32 ( Thr34) expression) was greater in high responders ( i. e ., rats with high lever pressing output) compared to low responders, indicating that accumbens core signal transduction activity is related to individual differences in work output.

We carried out an association study on 211 patients with early - onset BD of French origin and 1, 719 matched controls, who have been genotyped on an Illumina platform with 261, 525 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) passing quality control.

According to the genome - wide significance threshold of P = 5 × 10 − 8, no significant difference in allele frequencies was observed in our sample, but 17 SNPs showed a nominal P < 5 × 10 − 5 ( Table S2 in File S1 ), suggesting these loci may be associated with vulnerability to early - onset forms of BD.

On chromosome 5p13, we identified, in a French patient who manifested a first mood episode by the age of 17, a 90 - Kbp deletion removing the PLCXD3 promoter region as well as the first coding exon of the gene ( Figure 2 ), whereas no copy number variation has been previously reported in this region in the database of genomic variations ( http :// projects. tcag. ca / variation /).

However, recent data from larger cohort studies showed a polygenic component in BD [ 3 ], [ 39 ], consistent with a combine vulnerability resulting from many variants of weak effect.

Although the current nominally significant findings should be interpreted with caution and need replication in independent cohorts, our results displayed that the combined exploration of common and rare variants in BD can reveal identical pathways suggesting both approaches should be systematically used in further genetic exploration of this disorder.

According to the literature available on insect eggs, one possible reason for shape changes could result from an artefact related to the position of the egg, or could be the effect of egg developmental age, or to some other parameters related to the mother and / or the environment.

The level of differences between these two geographic populations was striking: the Mahalanobis distances as based on the egg contour ( 6. 5) were larger than between species of the Triatomini ( 6. 3 ), and larger also ( 2. 4 versus 1. 8) when based on the operculum.

It builds up large populations and adult individuals can be sampled throughout the year in agricultural and semi - natural habitats ( ref. 22, own observations ). D. suzukii entered ecosystems harbouring numerous native Drosophila species as well as their natural enemies.	"Drosophila	220	230	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 220, ""end_span"": 230, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
For example, in northern Switzerland twenty - five Drosophila species were identified at the edge of a single forest during a five month study23.	"Drosophila	51	61	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Thus, we assume that parasitoids of Drosophila present in Switzerland will accept D. suzukii as a host as well.	"Drosophila	36	46	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Eight species of parasitoids from four families of Hymenoptera emerged from the traps baited with D. melanogaster and set up in different locations in Switzerland ( Fig. 1; Table 1 ).	"Hymenoptera	51	62	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Hymenoptera"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The most common parasitoid was Pachycrepoideus vindemmiae ( Rondani ), of which the highest overall number of individuals emerged and that was present in all regions.	"Pachycrepoideus vindemmiae	31	57	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Pachycrepoideus vindemmiae"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The overall hatching rate of D. suzukii flies in the controls without larval parasitoids was 79. 79 ± 1. 21 %.	"flies	40	45	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""flies"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In L. heterotoma the presence of parasitoids ( GLM: W3, 72 = 5. 432, P = 0. 020) as well as the factor strain ( GLM: W3, 72 = 12. 194, P = 0. 007) but not the interaction of both factors had a significant influence on the reduction of D. suzukii flies.	"flies	246	251	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""flies"", ""start_span"": 246, ""end_span"": 251, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The strain from Basel - Land reduced fly emergence significantly more than the strain from Ticino. A. tabida did not have any influence on the number of D. suzukii emerging.	"fly	37	40	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""fly"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The overall hatching rate of D. suzukii flies in the controls without pupal parasitoids was 78. 14 ± 1. 40 %.	"flies	40	45	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""flies"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Reduction of D. suzukii emergence was significantly influenced by parasitoid presence ( GLM: W3, 36 = 111. 376, P < 0. 001 ), parasitoid strain ( strain Ticino: 37. 0% and strain Vaud: 61. 4% mean reduction; GLM: W3, 36 = 19. 297, P < 0. 001) and the interaction of both factors ( GLM: W3, 36 = 13. 385, P < 0. 001) in T. drosophila.

Several species of Drosophila parasitoids seem to have their geographic distribution borders within Switzerland.	"Drosophila	19	29	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
It might be also valid for the larval parasitoid A. tabida, which also interacts with the two Leptopilina species32 and of which the number of emerged parasitoids decreased over the course of the growing season.	"Leptopilina	94	105	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Leptopilina"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This species may play a particular role in shaping the communities of flies and parasitoids in Switzerland as it interacts with them in several ways.	"flies	70	75	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""flies"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Enhanced populations of the parasitoid may then affect other fly species via apparent competition.	"fly	61	64	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""fly"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
These habitats may play an important role for the population dynamics of D. suzukii as they can serve as reservoirs for the recolonization of crops after the application of insecticides and provide shelter for the flies during unfavourable weather conditions4546.	"flies	214	219	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""flies"", ""start_span"": 214, ""end_span"": 219, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Together with the already reported P. vindemmiae and T. drosophilae2738, they add to the community of species that could play a role in the control of D. suzukii. While parasitization rates varied largely among species, with most parasitoids emerging in P. vindemmiae and fewest in V. fidenas, all pupal parasitoids developed on D. suzukii at a rate comparable to that on the other two native Drosophila species tested.	"Drosophila	393	403	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 393, ""end_span"": 403, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In contrast to the pupal parasitoids, the larval parasitoids L. heterotoma, L. boulardi and A. tabida were not able to develop on D. suzukii in our study, although numbers of emerged flies were significantly reduced for D. suzukii in the presence of L. boulardi and L. heterotoma, probably due to unsuccessful parasitization events.	"flies	183	188	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""flies"", ""start_span"": 183, ""end_span"": 188, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
However, the immune response of the flies seems to be costly, as it is associated with a reduced feeding rate49 and a reduced fecundity of the surviving adults505152.	"flies	36	41	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""flies"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Within the Swiss populations of L. heterotoma differences in lethality to flies were observed among strains.	"flies	74	79	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""flies"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In particular for the larval parasitoids, studies with a long exposition time of samples in the field bear the risk of misinterpretation when native Drosophila were able to lay additional eggs in the bait and larvae hatching from those eggs then became parasitized.	"Drosophila	149	159	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 149, ""end_span"": 159, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
While many pupal parasitoids are known to develop on D. suzukii under controlled laboratory conditions and in no - choice assays, little information is available on the host - finding and host - choice behaviour in the presence of native Drosophila species.	"Drosophila	238	248	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 238, ""end_span"": 248, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
As the interactions among native and exotic flies with their natural enemies can be manifold, care has to be taken when implementing control measures against D. suzukii, as these might affect multiple species on several trophic levels.

By combining SRL imaging of PhDY with TPEF imaging of filipin, we observed that, unlike wildtype CHO cells, the PhDY - Chol - rich structures were stained by filipin, indicating that these PhDY - Chol molecules were located in lysosomes.	"filipin	54	61	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""filipin"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
This result is reasonable given that filipin has been shown to label other lipid molecules, such as glycosphingolipids24.	"filipin	37	44	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""filipin"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

In our study, through rational design and synthesis of a PhDY tag, we increased the Raman scattering cross section by 15 times compared to the alkyne group, and 88 times compared to the endogenous C = O group.	"alkyne	143	149	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""alkyne"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Importantly, this design also shielded the activity of terminal alkyne and significantly reduced cytotoxicity.	"alkyne	64	70	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""alkyne"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Cell membrane morphology did not alter when PhDY - Chol was supplemented at high concentrations when compared to the cells supplemented with the same concentrations of cholesterol ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ).

Moreover, the fluorescent property of pyrenedecanoic acid, a membrane fluidity indicator48, did not change after CHO cells were treated with 50 μM of PhDY - Chol or 50 μM of cholesterol for 16 h.	"cholesterol	174	185	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cholesterol"", ""start_span"": 174, ""end_span"": 185, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Our results show that PhDY - Chol is stored in LDs via esterification which can be blocked by ACAT - 1 inhibition.	"ACAT - 1	94	102	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ACAT - 1"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
We also showed that PhDY - Chol reflects the location of the cholesterol in real - time, unlike filipin staining, which requires fixation.	"cholesterol	61	72	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cholesterol"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Thus, unlike fluorophores, the PhDY tag does not undergo bleaching ( Supplementary Fig. 9 ), in contrast to BODIPY - cholesterol and DHE15 which is known to have a rapid photo - bleaching rate.

Note that before coating the PES fibers with fibrin, the surface of PES fibers is smooth ( Fig.	"fibrin	45	51	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""fibrin"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Furthermore, it does no present the same bioactive substrate to the ECFCs as the fibrin fibers.	"fibrin	81	87	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""fibrin"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Therefore, we coated the PES fibers with fibrin, resulting in the random, non - aligned nano - topography of coating presented in Fig.	"fibrin	41	47	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""fibrin"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Such PES fibers have a similar diameter ( 240 ± 45 µm; data not shown) as fibrin microfibers and thus enable us to investigate whether the uniaxial alignment topography contributes to the unique cellular activity and ECM organization.	"fibrin	74	80	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""fibrin"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

We next sought to determine whether ECFC actin filament alignment and microtubule organization direct ECM organization.	"actin	41	46	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""actin"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
We found that the unique wrapping arrangement of the deposited ECM molecules around the fibrin microfibers was still present after 24 and 48 hrs of treatment ( Fig. 4A and Fig.	"fibrin	88	94	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""fibrin"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

Likewise, when nocodazole, a microtubule polymerization disturbing agent, was added to the culture media at 24 hrs after ECFC seeding on microfibers, a similar ECM wrapping pattern was observed ( Fig. 4B; Fig.	"nocodazole	15	25	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""nocodazole"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
S5B ), and similar organization of wrapping ECM was observed when Nocodazole D was applied through the entire 3 days of culture ( Fig.	"Nocodazole D	66	78	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Nocodazole D"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Further analysis revealed this was also true for microfibers of ∼ 105 to ∼ 370 µm, and that the largest microfibers tested (∼ 445 µm) did not have a distinguishable collagen nano - fibril orientation ( Fig.	"collagen	165	173	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""collagen"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
One of the advantages of our fibrin microfiber system is the opportunity to co - culture vSMCs towards the study of their interactions with the endothelial layer as well as the deposition of ECM components that compose the tunica media.

ECFCs cultured on fibrin microfibers with diameter of 100 – 450 µm attached throughout the microfibers, creating a continuous monolayer over the entire microfiber with a distinctive elongated and mature morphology.	"fibrin	18	24	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""fibrin"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The fibrin microfibers thus offer an innovative approach in which ECFCs are seeded on the surface of an electrostretched microfiber, as opposed to in the body of a nanofiber mesh, as conventional electrospun scaffolds have been used [ 38 ], [ 39 ], [ 82 ], [ 83 ].	"fibrin	4	10	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""fibrin"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
This unique approach allows detailed control of the cellular assembly of microvasculature, as the fibrin microfibers present a blueprint with a unique aligned nanotopography around which ECFCs can adhere to.	"fibrin	98	104	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""fibrin"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
It is important to note that in longer period cultures of ECFCs on fibrin microfibers ( i. e. > 10days) we observed full coverage of the structures by ECM ( data not shown ).	"fibrin	67	73	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""fibrin"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The first scaffold used was a flat fibrin sheet with the same nanotopography as our original microfibers, varying therefore only the shape and geometry of the scaffold.	"fibrin	35	41	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""fibrin"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
ECFCs were found to align with the nanotopography of the fibrin sheets, but the ECM was deposited with no distinguishable organization.	"fibrin	57	63	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""fibrin"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The second scaffold used was a polymer fiber coated with fibrin, which maintains the microfiber ' s spatial geometry, but has a random surface topography.	"fibrin	57	63	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""fibrin"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Here, while ECFCs were not induced to align with the fiber ' s longitudinal axis, they still deposited ECM wrapping circumferentially around the polymer fiber, similarly to ECFCs seeded on fibrin microfibers.	"fibrin	189	195	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""fibrin"", ""start_span"": 189, ""end_span"": 195, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
For this, vSMCs were introduced into the model after 5 days of ECFC culture on the fibrin microfibers.	"fibrin	83	89	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""fibrin"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Ongoing studies explore the degradation of the fibrin microfibers to generate a hollow microstructure with a defined lumen towards their use for applications in vivo.	"fibrin	47	53	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""fibrin"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Thus, our system further offers future opportunities to fully correct the initial ECFC polarity and to study flow - induced vSMC organization post fibrin core degradation	"fibrin	147	153	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""fibrin"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Using this model we are able to guide organized microvascular structure formation, inducing endothelial cell alignment and elongation, and demonstrating circumferential deposition of ECM proteins by ECFCs.

Considering that the temperature difference between urban and rural areas fall frequently within the range of the expected temperature increases by 2, 100 under IPCC ( 2013) scenarios, adaptation to urban environments can inform on the impact of climate change on organisms ( Chown & Duffy, 2015; Youngsteadt, Dale, Terando, Dunn, & Frank, 2015; Youngsteadt, Ernst, Dunn, & Frank, 2017 ).

We here focused on geographic differentiation in TPCs for growth rate, a commonly used performance trait ( Angilletta, 2009 ), between replicated urban and rural populations of an aquatic insect using a common garden rearing experiment with a range of temperatures.

Very few studies focused on effects of urbanization in damselflies ( Tüzün, Debecker, Op de Beeck, & Stoks, 2015; Tüzün, Op de Beeck, & Stoks, 2017; Villalobos ‐ Jiménez, Dunn, & Hassall, 2016; Villalobos ‐ Jiménez & Hassall, 2017 ), and these did not consider differentiation in TPCs.	"damselflies	55	66	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""damselflies"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This sampling design was applied in several recent studies where effects of urbanization on organisms are investigated ( Brans et al ., 2017; Kaiser, Merckx, & Van Dyck, 2016; Piano et al ., 2017; Tüzün et al ., 2015, 2017 ).

Head width is an often used measure to estimate size and growth in damselfly larvae ( for an example in the study species: Mikolajewski, Brodin, Johansson, & Joop, 2005 ).	"damselfly	67	76	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""damselfly"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The following random effects were added where appropriate: population, nested within urbanization level ( accounting that animals from the same pond are not independent replicates, thereby avoiding pseudoreplication ), female identity of the offspring ( accounting for among ‐ brood variation ), individual identity of larvae ( there were two growth rate estimates, one per period, for each larva; i. e ., repeated ‐ measures design ).	"animals	122	129	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Despite the higher water temperatures in urban ponds, the TPCs for growth rate were not shifted horizontally toward higher optima in urban damselfly populations.	"damselfly	139	148	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""damselfly"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We did not find any evidence for the theoretically predicted higher thermal optima (“ hotter – colder ” model, Lynch & Gabriel, 1987; Gilchrist, 1995) of urban damselfly larvae that would suggest thermal adaptation.	"damselfly	160	169	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""damselfly"", ""start_span"": 160, ""end_span"": 169, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Although we used first generation animals, maternal effects seem unlikely to have played a major role because rural and urban populations did not differ in egg size and hatchling size ( Appendix S2 ), while differences in egg size are the most common way how maternal effects are transferred ( Mousseau & Dingle, 1991 ).	"animals	34	41	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This fits the pattern based on quantitative genetic rearing experiments that maternal effects on growth rate are absent or small in damselfly larvae ( Shama et al ., 2011; Sniegula, Golab, Drobniak, & Johansson, 2016 ).	"damselfly	132	141	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""damselfly"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Predators of damselfly larvae did, however, not differ in densities between the here studied urban and rural ponds ( see Appendix S8 ).	"damselfly	13	22	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""damselfly"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In agreement with our finding, aquatic macro ‐ invertebrate community structures are not driven by urbanization in the study region ( C.	"invertebrate	47	59	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""invertebrate"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Souffreau, personal communication ), and a recent study reported no difference in species richness of aquatic macro ‐ invertebrates from urban and nonurban ponds in the United Kingdom ( Hill et al ., 2017 ).

Indeed, tadpoles exposed to a herbicide had on average upwards shifted (“ faster – slower ” differentiation) and narrower TPCs (“ generalist – specialist ” differentiation) for swimming speed ( Katzenberger et al ., 2014 ).	"tadpoles	8	16	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""tadpoles"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Despite the widespread evidence of urban heat islands ( Gaston et al ., 2010 ), surprisingly few studies documented differentiation in TPCs between rural and urban populations, and as these all directly measured traits on field ‐ collected animals, it is unknown to what extent these differentiations are genetic rather than environmentally driven ( reviewed in Chown & Duffy, 2015 ).	"animals	240	247	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 240, ""end_span"": 247, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In the only study considering continuous TPCs, which is essential to discriminate between the models ( Richter ‐ Boix et al ., 2015 ), two different patterns of thermal differentiation were observed when rearing four species of soil fungi directly isolated from one urban population and from one rural population ( McLean, Angilletta, & Williams, 2005 ).	"fungi	233	238	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""fungi"", ""start_span"": 233, ""end_span"": 238, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Two fungus species followed the “ hotter – colder ” model, with isolates from the urban population growing faster at 26 ° C, but slower at 18 ° C compared to isolates from the rural population.	"fungus	4	10	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""fungus"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In the two other fungus species, urban isolates grew as fast or faster at all temperatures than the rural isolates (“ faster – slower ” model ).	"fungus	17	23	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""fungus"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The authors suggested this is because high temperatures in urban areas inhibit fungal growth, resulting in restricted growing seasons for urban populations ( McLean et al ., 2005 ), while the higher temperatures in the urban damselfly populations, instead, were beneficial and increased the length of the growing season.

Costs of rapid growth may be manifold ( Dmitriew, 2011 ), and in damselfly larvae include decreased investment in energy storage ( Stoks, De Block, & McPeek, 2006 ), reduced immune function ( De Block & Stoks, 2008b ), and increased oxidative stress ( De Block & Stoks, 2008a ).

Urban environments have the potential to provide unique information and aid in developing predictions on the impact of climate change on organisms ( Chown & Duffy, 2015; Youngsteadt et al ., 2015, 2017 ), and the use of cities as natural experiments has recently been promoted.

As exosomes naturally carry RNA between cells, these particles might be useful in gene cancer therapy to deliver therapeutic short interfering RNA ( siRNA) to the target cells.

After the discovery that synthetic siRNAs can be exogenously introduced into cells to activate RNAi [ 8 ], this approach has become a powerful method for selective suppression of specific genes of interest in different species, showing potential for use in cancer therapeutics [ 2, 3 ].

However, the biomedical utility of the synthetic siRNAs is limited by several RNA structure - related factors such as the negative charge ( uptake by cells that also have a negatively charged surface) and instability in the blood circulation ( non - modified siRNAs have a very short half - life in the blood stream, mostly because of degradation by nucleases) [ 9 ].

Our data pointed to RAD51 as a potential target for repressing the growth of abnormally proliferating cells [ 21 ].	"RAD51	20	25	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RAD51"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Here, we show that the exosome - delivered siRNA against RAD51 was also functional and caused the massive reproductive cell death of recipient cells.	"RAD51	57	62	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RAD51"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In most of the cancer cell lines such blocks resulted in dramatic decrease in cell viability accompanied by apoptosis or irreversible loss of their ability to proliferate.

In particular, the multivariate model ( Table 5) indicates that the probability of an ALND negative is significantly higher in patients with LA subtype tumor, negative LVI, SLN OSNA + and ≤ 2150 copies.

We found that a cut - off of > 2150 CK19 mRNA copies identifies false and true positive and negative cases very efficiently, and therefore it better identifies which patients really need an ALND and which patients do not.	"CK19	36	40	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CK19"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

In this current study, however, we included a new consecutive, prospective and much larger series of BC patients analyzing not just part, but the entire SLN.	"BC	101	103	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""BC"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Deambrogio et al. [ 22] demonstrated that a specific cut - off of 7700 copies may be useful to identify patients with one or more positive non - SLN, independently of the characteristics of the primary tumor.	"primary tumor	194	207	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""primary tumor"", ""start_span"": 194, ""end_span"": 207, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
However, in Deambrogio ’ s work, only 60% of their breast cancer patients with a positive SLN for micrometastasis underwent an axillary dissection.	"breast cancer	51	64	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""breast cancer"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Heilmann et al. [ 24] found that a cut - off CK19 mRNA copy number of 7900 obtained using ROC analysis indicates a positive non - SLN result with the highest sensitivity and specificity.	"CK19	45	49	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CK19"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
This result was obtained by separately processing 1 mm central slides for histology and the rest for OSNA, and therefore it might not represent the real copy number of CK19 mRNA of the entire lymph node.

Thanks to this surgical approach, today, we have a complete and global dataset regarding the axillary status of a large and consecutive cohort of breast cancer patients.

In our current series, in fact, 23 out of the 50 cases ( 46 %) with a CK19 mRNA copy number between 2150 and 7700 had a positive ALND ( data not shown ).	"CK19	70	74	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CK19"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Furthermore, it is important to underline that the cut - off value of > 2150 copies was identified in two different and particularly large series of BC patients, the first of 709 patients and the current of 1140 patients for a total of 1849 patients.	"BC	149	151	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""BC"", ""start_span"": 149, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Interestingly, none of the false negative patients was a Luminal A subtype and all of them had a high Ki - 67, while the subset of false positive patients showed a significantly higher percentage of Luminal A subtype compared to the true positive one.

In fact, the model indicated that the probability of finding an ALND positive was significantly higher in patients with LBH +, HS, LVI positive, OSNA ++ and OSNA > 2150 copies.	"LBH	120	123	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LBH"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
For these reasons, we can establish the biological profile of the primary tumor before the sentinel biopsy.	"primary tumor	66	79	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""primary tumor"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
This approach is particularly important for patients with a SLN with an intermediate copy number ( 2150 – 5000) which represented 5% of the entire series of early breast cancer patients.	"breast cancer	163	176	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""breast cancer"", ""start_span"": 163, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The meta analysis by Li et al. [ 26] which systematically reviewed the current studies regarding the safety and efficacy of SLNB alone versus ALND in early breast cancer with SLN metastasis, highlights that high - quality prospective trials on larger populations are needed to further clarify this controversial issue.	"breast cancer	156	169	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""breast cancer"", ""start_span"": 156, ""end_span"": 169, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
However, a positive SLN, which reflects the nodal tumor burden, is of particular clinical value as a predictive tool for further non - sentinel involvement.	"tumor	50	55	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumor"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Two large multicentric studies, which developed nomograms to predict non - SLN positivity based on the CK19 mRNA copy number determined by OSNA assay, have been recently published [ 27, 28 ].	"CK19	103	107	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CK19"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Furthermore, we propose that, for patients with a copy number that ranges between 2150 and 5000, the decision on whether to perform an ALND or not should be taken after a multidisciplinary discussion concerning the clinical and bio - morphological features of primary breast cancer.

In order to avoid an under treatment of breast cancer patients with a positive SLN, a multidisciplinary team approach, and excellent communication and cooperation between clinicians is essential to ensure that each patient ’ s outcome is maximized while minimizing morbidity.

In this study, 206 barley accessions collected worldwide were genotyped with 408 Diversity Arrays Technology ( DArT) markers and evaluated for salinity stress tolerance using salinity tolerance score – a reliable trait developed in our previous work.

It has been estimated that 20% of arable land worldwide is salinized which mainly results from natural causes, such as climate change and human influence factors like poor irrigation management ( Flowers and Yeo, 1995; FAO, 2008 ).

At the whole - plant level, salinity stress is considered to be composed of two phases: a rapid osmotic stress which reduces shoot growth, and slower ionic stress which accelerates senescence of older leaves due to elevated leaf Na + content ( Munns and Tester, 2008 ).	"plant	15	20	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""plant"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Osmotic stress affects plant growth by reducing cell expansion and elongation rates, which leads to smaller and thicker leaves, and down - regulated photosynthesis by reducing stomatal aperture ( Bradford, 1976 ).

Barley is indispensable to malting and brewing industries and also serves as a staple food in some areas of the world due to its broad adaption to salinity, drought, and high altitude ( Baik and Ullrich, 2008 ).

Both genetic diversity and adaption to broad conditions resulted in a rich gene pool of barley ( Nevo and Chen, 2010 ).	"barley	88	94	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""barley"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

In barley, GWAS has been used for detecting genetic variations underlying diverse complex traits such as agronomic and morphologic traits ( Cockram et al ., 2010; Pasam et al ., 2012; Wang et al ., 2012; Munoz - Amatriain et al ., 2014 ), malting quality related traits ( Huang et al ., 2014; Matthies et al ., 2014; Cai et al ., 2015 ), cadmium accumulation ( Wu et al ., 2015 ), frost tolerance ( Visioni et al ., 2013 ), aluminum tolerance ( Cai et al ., 2013; Zhou et al ., 2016) and salinity tolerance ( Long et al ., 2013 ).

Barley accessions exhibited significant difference in their salinity tolerance.	"Barley	0	6	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Barley"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 6, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Since the scoring was conducted at a relatively early stage of salt treatment when clear phenotypic segregation was shown, most of the sensitive varieties ( e. g ., Franklin, Gairdner) were scored for five while the tolerant varieties ( CPI - 11284 - 48, TX9425) had a score of 1.

Mercury content in the examined samples was higher in the first two research periods ( April IV, June VI ), and then, in the following periods, the accumulation of mercury decreased both in soil and leaf samples of the two tree species.	"tree	223	227	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""tree"", ""start_span"": 223, ""end_span"": 227, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
There are two ways of mercury transfer to plants: from the atmosphere and from the soil ( Kabata - Pendias 2001; Ericksen and Gustin 2004; Poissant et al. 2008, Pérez - Sanz et al. 2012 ).	"plants	42	48	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""plants"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The availability of mercury in soil is low for plants, and its accumulation in roots is not observed.	"plants	47	53	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""plants"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This was found in the studies of polluted soils, in which a positive correlation between mercury concentrations in the soil and plants was not determined ( Pérez - Sanz et al. 2012; Lodenius 2013; Amorós et al. 2014 ).	"plants	128	134	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""plants"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
It was found that mercury concentration in leaves varies with the age of a plant, time of day and year ( Ericksen et al. 2003; Rutter et al. 2011; Tabatchnick et al. 2012 ).	"plant	75	80	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""plant"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Moreover, the trees growing in large urban areas and experiencing the adverse effects of mercury may develop conditions such as chlorotic spots, brown spots on the edges of the lamina, and shortening and deformation of buds and roots.	"trees	14	19	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""trees"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
It has been estimated that the average content of mercury in plants is 100 – 1000 ng g − 1 ( Yudovich and Ketris 2005; Garcia - Sánchez et al. 2009 ).	"plants	61	67	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""plants"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Mercury is adsorbed on colloids in soil, and the rate of this process depends primarily on the composition of the soil, amount of organic matter, quantity and type of clay minerals, hydrated oxides, pH and redox potential ( Kabata - Pendias 2001; Pérez - Sanz et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2015 ).	"hydrated oxides	182	197	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""hydrated oxides"", ""start_span"": 182, ""end_span"": 197, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Mercury in soil originates from three sources: Natural processes, i. e. weathering of rocks, volcanic eruptions and geothermal activity. Anthropogenic activities and re - deposition of mercury previously emitted to the atmosphere ( Wang et al ., 2012; Wang et al. 2014a ); it is believed that deposition from the atmosphere is the main anthropogenic source of mercury in soils ( Gupta and Nirwan 2015 ). Leaves fallen from trees; they supply surface soil layers with mercury ( Ericksen et al. 2003; Rutter et al. 2011; Tabatchnick et al. 2012 ).	"trees	423	428	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""trees"", ""start_span"": 423, ""end_span"": 428, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In dry soils, mercury bound to organic matter can be methylated by bacteria and become a source of methylmercury both for the soil and water ( Kloke et al. 1984; Rutter et al. 2011 ).	"bacteria	67	75	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bacteria"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Many authors have studied the effect of mercury concentration on the soil and air on the content of this metal in plants, especially in their leaves ( Ericksen et al. 2003; Ericksen and Gustin 2004; Fay and Gustin 2007; Niu et al. 2013; Amorós et al. 2014 ).	"plants	114	120	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""plants"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
They were focused on assessing changes in the mercury content of plants during the experiment in which mercury concentrations in the soil or air were modified.	"plants	65	71	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""plants"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

Based on the results of mercury concentrations in the samples of soil ( n = 88 ), buds ( n = 22) and leaves ( n = 66) of the two tree species, the Shapiro - Wilk test was performed.

When analysing average mercury concentrations in soil and tree samples, it was observed that the average value of Hg for soils in November ( XI) ( 58. 7 ng g − 1) was lower than the value determined in April ( IV) ( 65. 3 ng g − 1 ).

The probable reason for the highest concentrations of mercury in leaves, determined in June, was the fact that the plants uptake minerals, including mercury, from soil, and this process is the most intensive in the initial vegetative phase.	"plants	115	121	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""plants"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Additionally, gaseous mercury can be assimilated into the plant system from the atmosphere through the stomata of leaves, and mercury bound to particulate matter can be adsorbed on the surface of leaves.

Poissant et al.

In phase III studies, these therapies improved progression - free survival ( PFS) of patients with mRCC over the diverse comparators [ 4 – 11 ], but the effect on OS was less pronounced, likely ( partly) due to treatment crossover.

This seems to imply that symptoms might increase due to progression of disease ( and / or due to the spread of the cancer to the bone or brain ), which explains the reduced HRQoL.

Nevertheless, since there were already no significant differences between the luciferase activity of the 296. pGL2 construct and of the empty pGL2.

Since it is generally accepted that DAC and TSA synergistically affect gene expression, by a mechanism that depends on promoter demethylation induced by DAC and subsequent reinforcement by histone acetylation induced by TSA, we also treated SH - SY5Y with TSA for 24 h, and with DAC for 96 h prior to a 24 h treatment with TSA.

Recently, several potential alternative transcription start sites were identified in PDHA2 gene [ 15 ].	"PDHA2	85	90	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PDHA2"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Indeed, as the qPCR assay used a TaqMan probe hybridizing to the 3 ′ UTR of the PDHA2 mRNA, the presence of eventual shorter truncated transcripts could not be discarded.	"PDHA2	80	85	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PDHA2"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
We detected the expected amplification product with 459 bp only in DAC - treated cells, which proves that DAC promotes the transcription of a full - length PDHA2 transcript ( Fig. 7 ).

These results are consistent with our previous work [ 14 ], and strongly suggest that PDHA2 reactivation in somatic cells proceeds via a mechanism independent of promoter demethylation, most probably dependent on demethylation of the coding region.	"PDHA2	86	91	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PDHA2"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
However, the lack of a suitable cell line to study the regulatory mechanisms underlying PDHA2 gene expression has hampered this elucidation for a long time.	"PDHA2	88	93	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PDHA2"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Moreover, and in each cell line, no significant differences were found among the reporter gene activities driven by all the other PDHA2 deletion promoter constructs.	"PDHA2	130	135	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PDHA2"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
These observations suggested that the mechanisms involved in the repression of PDHA2 expression in somatic cells are not operative when the core promoter or the 5 ′ flanking region are transiently transfected into somatic cells.	"PDHA2	79	84	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PDHA2"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
However, we could not replicate their results concerning the detection of several enhancer and repressor elements, because no significant differences in luciferase reporter activities were detected between the various deletion constructs.

Additionally, the same authors suggested the existence of a putative Sp responsive element that would be important for Sp1 - dependent transcription initiation [ 5 ].	"Sp1	119	122	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sp1"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The fact that treatment with DAC alone elicited a significant effect upon PDHA2 gene expression suggests that changes associated with methylation are sufficient to drive transcription initiation of this testis - specific gene in somatic cells.	"PDHA2	74	79	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PDHA2"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Our results demonstrated that DAC promoted a relevant demethylation of PDHA2 coding region, which was fully methylated before treatment.	"PDHA2	71	76	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PDHA2"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
These findings corroborate our previous reported results, where we observed that PDHA2 expressing tissues ( i. e spermatogenic cells) presented the coding region completely demethylated, while non - expressing tissues displayed it fully methylated [ 14 ].	"PDHA2	81	86	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PDHA2"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The results obtained either then by in - vivo or now by ex - vivo experiments are overlapping; actually, both methylation analyses revealed a correlation between demethylation of the coding region and PDHA2 derepression.	"PDHA2	201	206	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PDHA2"", ""start_span"": 201, ""end_span"": 206, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
However, Yamashita and colleagues [ 15] recently identified multiple transcriptional start sites downstream of the canonical one (+ 248, + 253 and + 269 ), which are located precisely within the CpG island II region ( nucleotides + 197 to + 460 ).	"nucleotides	218	229	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""nucleotides"", ""start_span"": 218, ""end_span"": 229, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Accordingly, this region could eventually harbor alternative promoter that would trigger the transcription of truncated PDHA2 mRNAs.	"PDHA2	120	125	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PDHA2"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
These data are corroborated by the significant enrichment of RNA pol II at the proximal promoter.	"RNA pol II	61	71	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RNA pol II"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Taken together, our results confirm that methylation of the coding region is a key point in somatic cell silencing of PDHA2 gene.	"PDHA2	118	123	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PDHA2"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Accordingly, more or less distant methylated sequences, like the PDHA2 coding region, can promote gene repression.	"PDHA2	65	70	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PDHA2"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Interestingly, and as stated by Nan and co - workers, this type of repression is greater if the promoter itself is methylated [ 28 ], which is the case of PDHA2 promoter.	"PDHA2	155	160	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PDHA2"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 160, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Furthermore, it has also been postulated that methylation of the coding region can inhibit gene expression by interfering with the elongation step rather than with transcription initiation, by causing RNA pol II to pause or to prematurely terminate [ 29 ], [ 30 ].	"RNA pol II	201	211	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RNA pol II"", ""start_span"": 201, ""end_span"": 211, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Based on this hypothesis, we attempted to explore elongation of PDHA2 transcription by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays.	"PDHA2	64	69	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PDHA2"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Accordingly, because PDHA2 gene lacks introns, different approaches need to be designed.	"PDHA2	21	26	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PDHA2"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In summary, we hypothesize that PDHA2 gene belongs not only to a restricted group of germ line - specific genes that use DNA methylation as a primary silencing mechanism, but to a unique subset of those genes whose expression is regulated by the methylation status of the coding region.

The number and distribution of scattered CpG sites and CpG islands of PDHA2 gene has been previously analyzed [ 14] using the online program MethPrimer, available at www. urogene. org / methprimer, which defines CpG islands as sequences longer than 200 bp, with a calculated CG composition > 50% and an observed to expected CpG ratio of > 0. 6 [ 35 ].

This domain is of particular interest because it represents the perfect example of the so - called ‘ strong ’ tissue - specific gene domain flanked by insulators, which delimit the area of preferential sensitivity to DNase I in erythroid cells.

In 9 - day RBCs, transcripts of all four β - globin genes were detected, and as expected, the transcript of the βA gene was the most abundant.	"β - globin	41	51	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""\u03b2 - globin"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

For this reason, normalization to the amount of cells ( 3 - day and 9 - day RBCs) used for the extraction of RNA ( Figure 1B) appears to be more appropriate for comparison of the absolute levels of globin gene transcription in these cells.

We have first fixed the anchor at the restriction fragment containing HS2 ( a part of β - globin domain LCR ).	"β - globin	86	96	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""\u03b2 - globin"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In the 3 - day RBCs, this anchor was shown to interact preferentially with the fragments containing the promoter of the embryonic gene ρ, the adult gene βA and the β / Ε - enhancer ( Figure 2B, blue curve ).

In addition, an elevated frequency of interaction of the HS2 with the upstream and the downstream insulators of the β - globin gene domain was observed.	"β - globin	116	126	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""\u03b2 - globin"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

It is evident that in both 3 - day and 9 - day RBCs, the insulators strongly interact with each other, thus forming a loop harboring the entire β - globin gene domain.	"β - globin	144	154	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""\u03b2 - globin"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In embryonic fibroblasts neither the interaction between the upstream and the downstream insulators of the β - globin gene domain nor an interaction of these insulators with any of the internal fragments of the domain was observed ( Figure 3A / B, green curves ).

The transcriptional switching of murine β - globin gene expression correlates with a reconfiguration of the ACH [ 24 ].	"β - globin	40	50	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""\u03b2 - globin"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In regard to the composition of the β - globin domain ACH in 3 - day and 9 - day RBCs, we noted several unexpected features.	"β - globin	36	46	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""\u03b2 - globin"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The fact that it was detected also in non - erythroid cells suggests that it may reflect some inherent feature of the β - globin gene domain spatial organization that is not directly related to the assembly of ACH.	"β - globin	118	128	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""\u03b2 - globin"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Thus, it is likely that the fine structure of the β - globin ACH is quite different in 3 - day and 9 - day RBCs.	"β - globin	50	60	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""\u03b2 - globin"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Even more evident developmental stage - specific recruitment to the ACH shows the promoter of the minor adult β - type globin gene βH.	"β - type globin	110	125	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""\u03b2 - type globin"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Taking into consideration the fact that the anchors placed on the LCR - HS2 and ρ gene promoter demonstrated no interaction with βH and a strong interaction with βA in 3 - day RBCs, one must assume that at this developmental stage, the promoters of the two adult β - type globin genes can either interact with each other outside the ACH or the βA promoter can be recruited to the ACH via interaction with the ρ gene promoter.	"β - type globin	263	278	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""\u03b2 - type globin"", ""start_span"": 263, ""end_span"": 278, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The two alternative configurations of the β - globin domain ACH in 3 - day RBCs are shown in Figure 4.	"β - globin	42	52	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""\u03b2 - globin"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In 9 - day RBCs, the level of mutual interaction of most of the regulatory elements of the β - globin gene domain increases compared to the levels in 3 - day RBCs.	"β - globin	91	101	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""\u03b2 - globin"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In other words, they possess certain features of mature chicken erythrocytes, which have non - active nuclei.	"chicken	56	63	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""chicken"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Nevertheless, the globin genes are still transcribed in the majority of 9 - day RBCs [ 40 ].	"globin	18	24	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""globin"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Thus, the concept that the apparently more compact spatial organization of the β - globin gene domain in 9 - day RBCs may simply reflect the presence of a substantial portion of mature erythrocytes in the analyzed cell population would not be correct.	"β - globin	79	89	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""\u03b2 - globin"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Rather, the β - globin gene domain suffers a certain amount of pressure because it is a part of the chromosomal territory that gradually acquires a more compact configuration.	"β - globin	12	22	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""\u03b2 - globin"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The obtained results strongly support the active chromatin hub model, as it has been found that distant regulatory elements located upstream of the β - globin gene cluster form a complex with the β / Ε enhancer located in the downstream portion of the cluster.

The embryonic β - globin gene Ε does not interact with any of the distal regulatory elements; thus, it is likely to possess an autonomous regulatory system.

In the United Kingdom, for instance, research ethics committees are expected to consider how a given research protocol ‘ enables ethical and worthwhile research of benefit to participants or to science and society ’, 3 and to consider how the ‘ benefits of research evidence for improved health and social care, should be distributed fairly among all social groups and classes .’ 4 Social value also appears prominently in the recently proposed revisions to the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects from the Council of International Organizations of Medical Sciences ( CIOMS ).

In order to label the lysosome with a size - selective membrane - permeable marker, T. b. brucei was pre - incubated for 30 min at 37 ° C with fluorescein - conjugated dextrans ( 500 kDa ).

The mechanism of TLF - induced cell lysis is controversial, but studies from our lab have shown that both freshly prepared normal human serum and TLF produce peroxidated lipids in T. b. brucei, suggesting a mechanism of killing [ 30 ].

"Depression	39	49	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Depression"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
With respect to Fatigue, there was a significant interaction for Measurement x Group x Gender with Fatigue score and IGF - 1 SDS at baseline as covariates, F ( 1, 24) = 5. 97, p = 0. 02, partial η2 = 0. 20.	"IGF - 1	117	124	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IGF - 1"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
ANOVAs separately performed for males and females with Fatigue score and IGF - 1 SDS at baseline as covariates yielded no significant interaction effect in males between Group and Measurement on Fatigue ( p > 0. 05 ).	"IGF - 1	73	80	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IGF - 1"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Therefore analyses were performed separately for males and females with Vigor score and IGF - 1 SDS at baseline as covariates.	"IGF - 1	88	95	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IGF - 1"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The present study demonstrated that, with respect to cognitive functioning as well as to wellbeing, gender appeared to render different effects of low and high dose GH treatment.	"GH	165	167	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GH"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 167, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In the present study no differential effects of the low and high dose GH treatment were found in males nor in females, with respect to PRM.	"GH	70	72	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GH"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Therefore, it may be concluded that the change in GH treatment did not specifically affect medial temporal lobe functioning.	"GH	50	52	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GH"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In contrast, SWM was affected by the different GH doses, but only in females.	"GH	47	49	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GH"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Notably, the decrease in IGF - 1 in the second treatment year was accompanied by an improvement of memory performance.	"IGF - 1	25	32	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IGF - 1"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Thus, the chronically given GH dose may have impaired memory functions, while reducing the dose counteracted the harmful effects on memory function.	"GH	28	30	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GH"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The finding that specifically frontal memory function is affected may be explained by different IGF - 1 receptor densities in temporal and frontal brain area.	"IGF - 1 receptor	96	112	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IGF - 1 receptor"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The highest densities of IGF - 1 receptors have been found in the hippocampus, amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus, while intermediate densities were observed in the cerebral cortex [ 32 ].	"IGF - 1 receptors	25	42	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IGF - 1 receptors"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The density of IGF - 1 receptors in the temporal lobe may be that high, that the sensitivity of the neuronal system has already reached its upper limit.	"IGF - 1 receptors	15	32	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IGF - 1 receptors"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
It may thus be concluded that the decrease of GH dose is detrimental for the subjectively perceived vitality.	"GH	46	48	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GH"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Vigor has been found to be quite closely associated with IGF - 1 levels [ 28, 29 ].	"IGF - 1	57	64	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IGF - 1"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The present finding that the decrease in IGF - 1 levels is associated with more fatigue and less vigor is in line with these former findings.	"IGF - 1	41	48	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IGF - 1"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
However, we observed these negative effects of decreased IGF - 1 levels on these mood states only in females.	"IGF - 1	57	64	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IGF - 1"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Indeed, in the present study females reported a larger percentage of sleep problems ( NHP) at baseline than males ( 36% versus 11 %, p = 0. 04, one - tailed ).	"sleep problems	69	83	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""sleep problems"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Moreover, the percentage of reported sleep problems was larger compared to baseline in females in LD group ( 37% versus 27 %, p = 0. 04, one - tailed ).	"sleep problems	37	51	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""sleep problems"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In the present study no differential effects of the low and high dose GH treatment were found in males nor in females, with respect to QoL scores.	"GH	70	72	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GH"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
A beneficial effect of GH treatment on QoL has been demonstrated in several ( mainly long duration) studies reviewed by Hazem et al. [ 50 ].	"GH	23	25	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GH"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The strength of the present study is that the effect of changing the GH dose was examined concerning memory and wellbeing, separately in females and males.	"GH	69	71	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GH"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In addition, the effect sizes of the results for memory and vigor appeared to be quite high, indicating that the effects of lowering the GH dose are quite substantial and may be assumed to have clinical significance.	"GH	137	139	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GH"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
We recommend that in future research the effects of GH treatment on memory and wellbeing will be studied in larger samples of male and female patient groups in blinded randomized clinical trials.	"GH	52	54	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GH"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Taking these differential effects on cognition and mood into account, the adjustment of GH dose in female patients seems to have a narrow window.	"GH	88	90	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GH"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Microsatellite marker analysis of Haemonchus contortus populations from Pakistan suggests that frequent benzimidazole drug treatment does not result in a reduction of overall genetic diversity	"Haemonchus contortus	34	54	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Haemonchus contortus"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The impact of drug selection pressure on the overall genetic diversity of parasitic nematode populations in the field is poorly understood.	"nematode	84	92	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""nematode"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In this study, we address this issue for the small ruminant parasite Haemonchus contortus in the Punjab, Pakistan.	"Haemonchus contortus	69	89	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Haemonchus contortus"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This region provides an opportunity to compare H. contortus populations that have been subjected to a prolonged period of frequent benzimidazole drug treatments on government farms with parasite populations that have been exposed to little or no drug treatment in neighbouring pastoral herds.

For the seven parasite populations in which resistance mutations were found, the diversity, geographical distribution and phylogenetic relationships of isotype - 1 β - tubulin benzimidazole resistance haplotypes were determined.	"isotype - 1 β - tubulin	152	175	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""isotype - 1 \u03b2 - tubulin"", ""start_span"": 152, ""end_span"": 175, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In addition, sequence analysis of the isotype - 1 β - tubulin locus revealed multiple F200Y ( TAC) haplotypes demonstrating soft selective sweeps even in government herds with little or no contemporary parasite migration.

The results suggest that, although the frequent drug treatment used on government farms has selected for a high frequency of benzimidazole resistance mutations, there has been little or no reduction in the overall genetic diversity of the selected parasite populations.

In addition, phylogenetic analysis of isotype - 1 β - tubulin haplotypes reveals multiple F200Y ( TAC) haplotypes are present in H. contortus on the closed government herds suggesting the presence of soft selective sweeps in the absence of significant contemporary parasite migration.

Five of these H. contortus populations were collected from sheep comprising two from the Lahore abattoir ( Pop16S and Pop13S ), one from the Sargodha abattoir ( Pop24S ), one from the Jahangirabad government farm ( Pop3S) and one from the Okara government farm ( Pop1S ).

A 328 bp fragment, spanning exons 4 and 5 and intervening intron of the isotype - 1 β - tubulin gene was PCR amplified from pooled DNA lysates for each of the 21 H. contortus populations ( Additional file 1: Table S1 ).

A total of 43 miRNAs ( 22 up - regulated and 21 down - regulated) in adult tissue and 42 miRNAs ( 4 up - regulated and 38 down - regulated) in the cyst membrane were identified ( Figure 4b ).

However, a high rate of the loss of conserved miRNA loci has been found in many subgroups of the Platyhelminthes [ 9 ].	"Platyhelminthes	97	112	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Platyhelminthes"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Basing on evolutionary conservation analysis, we also found a significant loss of conserved miRNAs in the Cestoda.	"Cestoda	106	113	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Cestoda"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
A total of 22 conserved miRNA families were confirmed as not detectable in E. granulosus, suggesting that the loss of conserved miRNA loci in flatworms is not a random event in metazoan phylogenetics.	"flatworms	142	151	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""flatworms"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Through comparing these lost miRNA families in E. granulosus, we found 8 are not detected in the parasitic Platyhelminthes compared with S. mediterranea and 6 are absent from S. japonicum and E. granulosus.	"Platyhelminthes	107	122	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Platyhelminthes"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
On further analysis of their evolutionary origin, we observed that most of the lost miRNAs may be derived from some specific tissues, which have been reduced or lost in tapeworms.	"tapeworms	169	178	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""tapeworms"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
For example, there are 8 conserved miRNA families expressed in the free - living S. mediterranea that are absent in the Neodermata.	"Neodermata	120	130	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Neodermata"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
These organs have gradually disappeared in E. granulosus and some of the other parasitic Platyhelminthes groups because of a significant decrease in locomotor and digestive activities associated with the parasitic mode of life.	"Platyhelminthes	89	104	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Platyhelminthes"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Thus, it seems that the loss of miRNA loci in E. granulosus may be related to the reduction or loss of some specific tissues in the Cestoda.	"Cestoda	132	139	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Cestoda"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Although previous studies did not report there was any miRNA family acquired in the Platyhelminthes [ 8, 9 ], we observed that mir - 3479 was present in E. granulosus, S. mansoni and S. japonicum.	"Platyhelminthes	84	99	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Platyhelminthes"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
These results imply that the gain of miR - 3479 in E. granulosus or S. japonicum may have resulted as an evolved adaptation in the parasitic Platyhelminthes to moderate the host immune response.

Handed Foraging Behavior in Scale - Eating Cichlid Fish: Its Potential Role in Shaping Morphological Asymmetry	"Cichlid Fish	43	55	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Cichlid Fish"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In wild - caught adult fish we found that mouth laterality is, as expected, a strong predictor of their preferred attack orientation.	"fish	23	27	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""fish"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Also laboratory - reared juvenile fish exhibited a strong laterality in behavioral preference to feed on scales, even at an early age, although the initial level of mouth asymmetry appeared to be small.	"fish	34	38	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""fish"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This suggests that pronounced mouth asymmetry is not a prerequisite for handed foraging behavior in juvenile scale - eating cichlid fish and might suggest that behavioral preference to attack a particular side of the prey plays a role in facilitating morphological asymmetry of this species.	"cichlid fish	124	136	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""cichlid fish"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The most familiar example of lateralized behavior comes from humans, where most individuals ( 89 %) are right - handed and a minority are left - handed ( 8 %) or ambidextrous ( 3 %) [ 1 ].	"humans	61	67	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""humans"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Lateralized behavior in fish is often correlated with morphological asymmetries.	"fish	24	28	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""fish"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
A significant correlation between lateralization in swimming and the anatomical bias of the prevalence of different muscle types was found in zebrafish [ 11 ].

This species is extremely ecologically specialized since most individuals either have a mouth that is bent to the left (‘ L - morph ’) or to the right (‘ R - morph ’) ( see Figure 1 ), although a recent study suggests frequent occurrences of fish with a rather symmetrical mouth ( Kusche, Lee, Meyer, in revision ).	"fish	242	246	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""fish"", ""start_span"": 242, ""end_span"": 246, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
L - morphs preferentially attack the right flanks of their prey fish while R - morphs attack the left flanks [ 8 ], [ 17 ]–[ 19 ].	"fish	64	68	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""fish"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This ‘ lateralized ( handed) foraging behavior ’ therefore represents an extreme form of specialization on a predominantly scale diet that is even restricted to scales from the left or the ride side of prey fish.

The resulting lateralized foraging behavior of P. microlepis is expected to make prey fish more alert to being attacked from the preferred side of the more abundant morph.	"fish	86	90	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""fish"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

Eleven of the three - month old fish were re - tested at seven months, but those individuals could not be traced due to logistical reasons.	"fish	32	36	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""fish"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Because it was impossible to enumerate number of scars and missing scales on the prey fish ( X. maculatus ), foraging preference was assessed for each scale - eater based on observed presence / absence of scars and missing scales.

For each seven - month old individual, its foraging behavior was monitored ( in 3 – 4 replicates during 1 – 2 weeks) by counting the number of attacks to the left and / or right flanks on a single goldfish, until a total of maximally 20 attacks per individual within up to 30 minutes were reached.

Behavioral foraging preference ( i. e. probability of left attack) was again found to be consistent among the 3 – 4 trials ( repeated - measure ANOVA; F 3, 45 = 0. 363, p = 0. 78) as observed in the three - month old fish.

For the two - month old scale - eaters, we employed the same procedure as for the seven - month old fish, except that we conducted only one experimental trial per individual.

To statistically analyze if juvenile P. microlepis fish show a bimodal or unimodal distribution in their foraging behavior ( e. g. foraging score, behavioral foraging preference ), the dip statistic [ 23] and a mixture analysis with a parametric bootstrap test ( 1000 iterations) using the mixtools package [ 24] were performed in R [ 25 ].

To investigate whether behavioral foraging preference is translated into foraging score ( e. g. number of scales bitten by the scale - eaters ), surface areas of attacked left and right flanks of prey ( i. e. surface areas of scars and missing scales) were calculated for a sub - sample ( n = 15) of the two - month old fish.

The mouth bending angle, ‘ α L − β R ’ in ° following [ 14] was measured to test for a relationship between mouth / head asymmetry and handed foraging behavior in juvenile fish.

To evaluate the accuracy of the measurements, repeatability of α L − β R was estimated from repeated and blind measurements that were done from two replicate photographs of the same individuals from sub - samples ( n = 20, 15 and 15 for the two -, three - and seven - month old fish, respectively ).

Most individuals showed a clear bias to attack only a particular side of their prey and the frequency distribution of the foraging score and behavioral foraging preference clearly exhibited a bimodal distribution ( except in the seven - month old fish) ( Figure 3 ).

Lateralized foraging behavior and foraging score ( e. g. number of scales eaten by the scale - eaters) are highly significantly correlated ( in a sub - sample [ n = 15] of the two - month old fish [ y = 1. 787x + 0. 176, R2 = 0. 759, p < 0. 001 ]).

Neither of the juvenile cohorts showed a significant correlation between mouth asymmetry and lateralized foraging behavior ( two - month old fish: r = 0. 148; p = 0. 255; three - month: r = − 0. 229; p = 0. 154; seven - month: r = 0. 069; p = 0. 749; Figure 5 ).

Unexpectedly, some fish that were morphologically scored as ( slightly) R - morphs ( with negative values of mouth bending angle of α L − β R) occasionally even attacked the right side more frequently than the left side, and vice versa ( Figure 5 ).

Note that 11 fish were tested at two different ontogenetic stages ( i. e. at three and seven months of age ).	"fish	13	17	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""fish"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
However, how and when lateralized foraging behavior manifests itself during ontogeny, and whether its association with mouth asymmetry is already apparent in juvenile individual fish had remained untested.	"fish	178	182	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""fish"", ""start_span"": 178, ""end_span"": 182, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The observed strong lateralization in foraging behavior in young scale - eaters ( e. g. bimodal distribution) that was not accompanied by notable morphological asymmetry ( see also Kusche, Lee, Meyer, in revision) and the obvious correspondence between mouth orientation and foraging behavior in adult fish might suggest that handed behavior is probably expressed earlier during development.	"fish	302	306	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""fish"", ""start_span"": 302, ""end_span"": 306, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
However, this hypothesis would seem to be rather unlikely given our observation that laboratory - reared fish of now about two - year of age still have a relatively symmetrical mouth ( HL, personal observation ).	"fish	105	109	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""fish"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The field foraging experiments with adult fish clearly demonstrate that manifested mouth laterality corresponds to a pronounced bias in feeding laterality.	"fish	42	46	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""fish"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This finding is consistent with previous studies that discovered strong correlations between mouth laterality and handed foraging behavior in adult fish [ 8 ], [ 17 ]–[ 19 ].	"fish	148	152	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""fish"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The foraging experiments with juvenile fish in the laboratory show that mouth asymmetry does not predict handedness in foraging behavior, possibly due to the small degree of mouth asymmetry.	"fish	39	43	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""fish"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Surprisingly, young and still quite small scale - eaters preyed on scales of prey fish and exhibited pronounced handed behavior ( Figure 3 ).	"fish	82	86	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""fish"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Nonetheless, the observed lack of correlation between mouth asymmetry and lateralized foraging behavior in juvenile P. microlepis might also result from the measurement technique used for the quantification of mouth asymmetry ( i. e. mouth bending angle) not fully capturing the existing true laterality ( i. e. asymmetric skeletal features) in the mouth / head apparatus of this fish.	"fish	380	384	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""fish"", ""start_span"": 380, ""end_span"": 384, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Further tests with cleared and double - stained juvenile fish samples of known behavioral laterality are required to check this possibility.	"fish	57	61	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""fish"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The lack of positive association between the level of mouth asymmetry and body size in the laboratory - reared juvenile fish further supports this hypothesis.	"fish	120	124	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""fish"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
By comparison, in wild - caught adult fish mouth asymmetry tends to increase with size ( Kusche, Lee, Meyer, in revision ), which would be expected if mouth asymmetry were to amplify over an individual ' s lifetime as a phenotypically plastic response to repeated attacks from one particular side [ 15 ], [ 18 ].

Although we are uncertain whether handed scale - eating behavior is genetically programmed ( innate ), rather than environmentally plastic ( learning) or both [ 42 ], the bimodal trait distribution in very young fish ( Figure 3) speaks for a major genetic locus determining handedness in scale - eating behavior ([ 18 ]).

Significant self - other discrepancies were indeed observed for all four behavioural outcome variables ( thoughts of self - harm, self - harm, thoughts of suicide and suicide attempts) and for both attitudinal outcome variables ( permissiveness towards self - harm and towards suicide attempts) but discrepancies were only significant for certain reference groups and were not always in the predicted direction.

An alternative is that our differing findings are indicative of inherent differences in the way that SSHB is perceived in comparison with previously studied behaviours ( e. g ., alcohol consumption) in terms of rightness / wrongness, positivity / negativity, personal responsibility, and their impact on others.

They know that mental illness does exist, so it is perceived as something that must occur elsewhere ( i. e ., in more distal groups) by default.	"mental illness	15	29	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""mental illness"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Similarly, adolescents may believe that due to the impact that others ’ SSHB would have on themselves ( e. g ., distress caused by a loved one suffering) they would be aware if those close to them had harmed themselves or attempted suicide, whereas they perhaps would not be so personally affected if loved ones engaged in more traditionally studied behaviours ( such as alcohol consumption, for example ).	"alcohol	371	378	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""alcohol"", ""start_span"": 371, ""end_span"": 378, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
However, the differences in the direction of discrepancies between the current findings and previous social norms findings suggest that SSHB is perceived somewhat differently to behaviours studied previously, perhaps in terms of their ethical or moral status, their links with mental illness, and their effect on others ( particularly in the case of suicide ).

A Pilot Study to Assess the Feasibility of the Spanish Diabetes Self - Management Program in the Basque Country	"Diabetes	55	63	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Diabetes"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of the Spanish Diabetes Self - Management Program ( SDSMP) in the primary care setting of the Basque Health Service and offer initial estimations of the randomized controlled trial ( RCT) effects. Methods.	"Diabetes	71	79	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Diabetes"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

T2DM is associated with an increased morbidity and mortality and it is thought to be responsible for 1. 5 million deaths in 2012 [ 3 ].	"T2DM	0	4	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""T2DM"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
It is estimated that diabetes accounts for between 6. 3 and 7. 4% of the costs in our health system [ 4 ].	"diabetes	21	29	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""diabetes"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Above all, T2DM is associated with cardiovascular system conditions, such problems being the cause of death in three - quarters of the patients.	"T2DM	11	15	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""T2DM"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The diabetes control is improving in our setting, although 64% of patients have HbA1c levels below 7% and only 50% have blood pressure readings under 140 / 80 mmHg [ 5 ].	"diabetes	4	12	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""diabetes"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The current Basque Country clinical practice guideline ( GPC) for T2DM recommends offering a structured educational program in order to empower the patients and encourage their active participation in the management of their condition [ 6 ].

Among programs on patient self - management, the most widely used structured approach is the Chronic Disease Self - Management Program ( CDSMP) [ 9] developed at Stanford University.

In this context, one of the trainings that offers the Active Patient Program (“ Paciente Activo ”) follows the SDSMP methodology and has been proposed as an instrument to promote self - care in people with T2DM.	"T2DM	206	210	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""T2DM"", ""start_span"": 206, ""end_span"": 210, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Patients with T2DM between the ages of 18 and 79 years were included.	"T2DM	14	18	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""T2DM"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Cardiovascular - Related Factors. The factors are body mass index ( BMI ), systolic and diastolic blood pressure ( SBP and DBP ), and total and HDL cholesterol levels.

Quality of Life. The Spanish version of the self - administered instrument, Audit of Diabetes - Dependent Quality of Life ( ADDQoL - 19 ), was used [ 23 ].	"Diabetes	85	93	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Diabetes"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
This scale is specific for patients with diabetes and consists of 19 items assessing leisure activities, relationships, and living conditions.	"diabetes	41	49	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""diabetes"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Self - Efficacy. The Spanish Diabetes Self - Efficacy Scale developed at Stanford University [ 24] was administered.	"Diabetes	29	37	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Diabetes"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
This questionnaire assesses frequency consumption of olive oil, fruit, vegetables, dairy products, cereal, red and white meat, fish, pasta or rice, legumes, commercial sweets, and beverages.	"fish	127	131	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""fish"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Body mass index ( BMI) and systolic ( SBP) and diastolic blood pressure ( DBP) were recorded, while HbA1c and cholesterol levels were assessed by blood samples.	"cholesterol	110	121	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cholesterol"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Further, no differences in BMI, total cholesterol levels, or cardiovascular risk were found ( Table 2 ).	"cholesterol	38	49	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cholesterol"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
On the other hand, no differences were observed in the general item, “ If I did not have diabetes, my quality of life would be …” ( p = 0. 263) or in the total ADDQoL - 19 score ( p = 0. 877) between the two moments ( Table 3 ).	"diabetes	89	97	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""diabetes"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The baseline characteristics of the current sample were comparable to those of the average diabetic patient in the Basque Country [ 4 ], except in that they were slightly younger and had lower levels of total cholesterol.	"cholesterol	209	220	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cholesterol"", ""start_span"": 209, ""end_span"": 220, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The good initial control of the local T2DM population and the short follow - up of the pilot study could be possible explanations of this lack of difference.	"T2DM	38	42	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""T2DM"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
It is important to note that although the target HbA1c level is the most widely used variable to date for assessing diabetes interventions, its use as the only method is currently being questioned.	"diabetes	116	124	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""diabetes"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Hence, it may be necessary to adapt the selection of variables to assess diabetes control to baseline levels of HbA1c, the length of time since diagnosis of the disease, and the presence of risk factors and cardiovascular morbidity [ 33 ].	"diabetes	73	81	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""diabetes"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
An improvement in scores on the specific self - efficacy questionnaire is a common finding in all evaluations on diabetes self - management [ 15, 36, 37 ].	"diabetes	113	121	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""diabetes"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
On the other hand, people with diabetes, who improve their disease knowledge and self - management skills, are more independent and use fewer healthcare resources.	"diabetes	31	39	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""diabetes"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
On one hand, the invitation letters were sent to T2DM patients, irrespective of whether or not they were fulfilling any other inclusion criteria than the age.	"T2DM	49	53	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""T2DM"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

In the first study, which lacked a control group, it was reported that 7 children with language impairments showed improvements on measures of language skills after just 4 weeks ' training with a computer - based program using acoustically modified speech.

The second reviewed general language interventions for children with spoken language disorders ( Cirrin & Gillam, 2008 ); two reviews, conducted by the What Works Clearinghouse, were intervention effectiveness reports looking at the effects of Fast ForWord on beginner readers and Fast ForWord - Language on English language learners ( What Works Clearinghouse, 2007, 2006 ).

These two studies used the same sample of children who were given both forms of intervention at the same time. Bishop, Adams, Lehtonen, and Rosen ( 2005) reported a small - scale study of a computerised program for training spelling skills given to children with language impairments.	"language impairments	263	283	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""language impairments"", ""start_span"": 263, ""end_span"": 283, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Similarly, Bishop, Adams, and Rosen ( 2006) used a computerised grammatical training program with children with receptive language impairments.	"language impairments	122	142	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""language impairments"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In summary, these two small - scale, well - controlled studies also failed to find evidence for the effectiveness of using acoustically modified speech ( comparable to that used in Fast ForWord) for training the language and literacy skills of children with language impairments.	"language impairments	258	278	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""language impairments"", ""start_span"": 258, ""end_span"": 278, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
These findings certainly throw considerable doubt on the claims made by the developers of Fast ForWord that suitable training can remediate rapid auditory processing problems and in turn improve the language skills of children with language impairments ( cf. Tallal et al ., 1996 ).	"language impairments	232	252	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""language impairments"", ""start_span"": 232, ""end_span"": 252, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
An integrative approach to characterize disease - specific pathways and their coordination: a case study in cancer	"cancer	108	114	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cancer"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In this work, using cancer as an example, we develop graph - based methods to integrate multiple microarray datasets to discover disease - related co - expression network modules.	"cancer	20	26	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cancer"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Many of these modules are consistent with or supported by their functional annotations or their previously known involvement in cancer.	"cancer	128	134	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cancer"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
While individual components of this module have been suggested to be associated with tumor suppression, their coordinated function has never been elucidated.	"tumor	85	90	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumor"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
We collected a series of microarray datasets measuring different types of cancers, and a series of datasets measuring other cellular / physiological conditions.	"cancers	74	81	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cancers"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
We then dissect the networks into cancer - subtype specific network modules by considering ( 1) co - expression dynamics and ( 2) network topology.	"cancer	34	40	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cancer"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Furthermore, by considering the second order cluster of a higher level of the hierarchy, which consists of both green and red clusters, the six networks are united to form two connected networks, reflecting the hierarchical modularity of cancer co - expression networks.	"cancer	238	244	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cancer"", ""start_span"": 238, ""end_span"": 244, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Network properties of the cancer differential co - expression network	"cancer	26	32	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cancer"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
This indicates that most gene - gene co - expression relationships differing between cancer and other phenotypes are associated with only a few “ hub ” genes.	"cancer	85	91	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cancer"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In fact, most hub genes fall into two main functional categories: 1) core processes of neoplastic states such as cell division and chromosome organization; or 2) dynamic interactions between cancer cells and their microenvironment such as angiogenesis, immune response, and cell adhesion ( see Supplementary Table 2 in Additional file 2 ).	"cancer	191	197	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cancer"", ""start_span"": 191, ""end_span"": 197, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
For those hub genes with unknown functions, we can predict their cancer - related functions based on their neighbor genes.	"cancer	65	71	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cancer"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The differential co - expression network provides a summary of co - expression links frequently active across all types of cancers.	"cancers	123	130	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cancers"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
However, it does not provide clues as to which set of links tend to be simultaneously active and inactive under which types of cancer.	"cancer	127	133	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cancer"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Thus, based on connectivity alone we cannot break the network into functionally coherent and cancer - subtype specific modules.	"cancer	93	99	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cancer"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
To dissect the networks, we integrate two types of information, the co - expression dynamics and the network connectivity, to extract cancer - subtype specific network modules.	"cancer	134	140	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cancer"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
This includes two steps: ( i) for any two genes connected with an edge in the differential co - expression network, we calculate the expression correlation in each of the 32 cancer microarray datasets and store it in a vector, termed the first - order expression correlation profile of the genes; ( ii) we then perform hierarchical clustering of all the gene pairs based on the Euclidean distance between the first - order expression correlation profiles.	"cancer	174	180	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cancer"", ""start_span"": 174, ""end_span"": 180, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Since each edge represents a frequently occurring co - expression relationship in multiple cancer datasets, it likely represents a functional link.	"multiple cancer	82	97	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""multiple cancer"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Their composition, network topology, and activation status across various cancer phenotypes can be seen in Supplementary table 3 in Additional file 2.	"cancer	74	80	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cancer"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The most predominant functional categories are cell cycle, cell division, cell proliferation, response to stress, immune response and cell adhesion ( see Supplementary Table 4 in Additional file 2 ), consistent with known pathological mechanisms of cancer.	"cancer	249	255	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cancer"", ""start_span"": 249, ""end_span"": 255, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
( B) Another network module that is activated in most of cancer datasets, consisting 9 genes and 9 edges.	"cancer	57	63	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cancer"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
( C) Left: a network that tends to be activated only in solid tumor datasets.	"solid tumor	56	67	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""solid tumor"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Average correlation in solid tumor datasets and other datasets are 0. 61 and 0. 17, respectively.	"solid tumor	23	34	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""solid tumor"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
One main feature of our approach is that it can simultaneously discover network modules and the types of cancer in which the modules are activated.	"cancer	105	111	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cancer"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

The genes of the module are mostly involved in cell division and genetic stability, representing a cell proliferation signature, a key feature of cancer.	"cancer	146	152	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cancer"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

In the next section, we will detail two network modules which are activated predominately in breast cancer data sets.	"breast cancer	93	106	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""breast cancer"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Network modules in the breast cancer cluster	"breast cancer	23	36	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""breast cancer"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Our analysis resulted in a second - order cluster containing two connected network modules that tend to be more active in all seven breast tumor datasets relative to the rest of the datasets.

Among the 52 genes, 16 are involved in cell adhesion ( p - value 7. 4 × 10 - 11 ), and 14 are involved cell - cell signalling ( p - value 7. 9 × 10 - 6 ), suggesting a role in tumor invasiveness of the module [ 11 ].

Many genes in this network module have been found to be involved in PDGF superfamily signaling.	"PDGF	68	72	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PDGF"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In total, we found direct Pubmed literature support for 19 out of the 52 member genes to be involved in ( or related to) the PDGF - superfamily signalling.	"PDGF	125	129	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PDGF"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
We screened the promoter regions of the 52 member genes, and found that the binding sites of ZNF148 are significantly enriched ( hypergeometric p - value 0. 016 ).	"ZNF148	93	99	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ZNF148"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In addition, it has been reported that PDGFR positively regulates collagen production ( for example [ 26 ], [ 27 ]).	"PDGFR	39	44	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PDGFR"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Although abundant evidence suggests the individual involvement of many of these genes in tumor suppression, their coordinated function has never been elucidated.	"tumor	89	94	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumor"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The tight and coordinated expression of the genes in this network module reveals an induced inflammatory response that may be important in breast tumor progression [ 40 ].

In the example of the two modules in the general cancer cluster in Figure 2a and 2b, each module may play different roles in the regulation of specific biological processes -- cell division and nucleic acid metabolism, respectively; the latter is clearly required for cell division.	"cancer	49	55	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cancer"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
As another example, the two breast cancer modules described in last section are also related.	"breast cancer	28	41	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""breast cancer"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Can the intake of antiparasitic secondary metabolites explain the low prevalence of hemoparasites among wild Psittaciformes?	"Psittaciformes	109	123	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Psittaciformes"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Infection varies significantly among taxa.	"Infection	0	9	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Infection"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Various factors might explain the differences in infection among taxa, including habitat, climate, host density, the presence of vectors, life history and immune defence.	"infection	49	58	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""infection"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
We gathered additional data on hemoparasites in wild Psittaciformes from the literature.	"Psittaciformes	53	67	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Psittaciformes"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We considered factors that may control the presence of hemoparasites in the Psittaciformes, compiling information on diet, habitat, and climate.	"Psittaciformes	76	90	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Psittaciformes"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In contrast, the infected parrots do not consume food items with antimalarial or even general antiparasitic properties.	"parrots	26	33	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parrots"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
When we combined our data with data from studies previously investigating blood parasites in wild parrots, the positive relationship between omnivorous diets and hemoparasite infestation was confirmed.	"parrots	98	105	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parrots"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Secondly, microscopy may underestimate the prevalence in cases of very low infection, poor quality of the blood smears, or if the observers are not properly trained ( e. g. [ 40, 41 ], and references therein ).	"infection	75	84	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""infection"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Various abiotic and biotic factors might also explain the large taxonomic variability of infection prevalence e. g. nesting habitat, nest characteristics, host density, temperature, elevation, topography, water availability and vector abundance [ 41, 45 – 47 ].	"infection	89	98	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""infection"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Several of these factors have been shown to influence the hemoparasite - host interactions by affecting parasite prevalence in the insect vectors and the probability of transmission to the avian host [ 20, 47 – 49 ].	"insect	131	137	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""insect"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Another possible reason for the variation in abundance of blood parasites includes the variable presence and density of the vectors [ 50, 54, 55 ], and the ability by the host immune system to resist or control infection [ 24 ].	"infection	211	220	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""infection"", ""start_span"": 211, ""end_span"": 220, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Food availability appears to play a key role by affecting the condition of the birds, which in turn can affect their susceptibility to parasites [ 56 – 58 ].	"birds	79	84	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""birds"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Accordingly, the avoidance of infections may positively affect host traits, such as reproduction and survival, allowing species not subject to pathogen pressure to locally outcompete other species or to become successful invaders in introduced communities [ 73, 74 ].	"infections	30	40	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""infections"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The wide range of habitats used, the gregarious behaviour and the nesting characteristics of the Psittaciformes could favour contact with the vectors and hence the transmission of parasites.	"Psittaciformes	97	111	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Psittaciformes"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Moreover, blood parasites appear to be common among captive parrots particularly in zoos ([ 24, 80 – 82 ], most records in [ 83 – 89 ]).	"parrots	60	67	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parrots"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Another explanation is that the absence of hemoparasites could be related to a strong innate immunity in some Psittaciformes [ 42, 93 ].	"Psittaciformes	110	124	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Psittaciformes"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Many parrots in the wild feed on toxic fruits, seeds or flower buds [ 96 – 98 ], whereas in captivity they obtain food that does not contain toxins [ 99 ].	"parrots	5	12	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parrots"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Thus, it could also be possible that parrots use secondary metabolites present in the diet as self - medication to reduce parasite load [ 61 – 69, 95 ].	"parrots	37	44	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parrots"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Alternatively, differences in the diet, habitats or environmental factors like climate could also determine the large interspecific variation in blood parasite prevalence reported for Psittaciformes ( Additional file 1: Table S1 and references therein ).	"Psittaciformes	184	198	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Psittaciformes"", ""start_span"": 184, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This includes diet selection and self - medication, which may determine the interspecific variation in blood parasite prevalence in vertebrates.	"vertebrates	132	143	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""vertebrates"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

We considered extrinsic and intrinsic factors that may control the presence of hemoparasites in Psittaciformes, compiling information on food items consumed, habitats used and climate.

Between 1999 and 2014, we obtained blood ( n = 329 ), liver ( n = 23 ), heart ( n = 1) and kidney ( n = 1) samples belonging to 19 Psittaciformes species from 25 localities.

For this reason, following González et al. [ 20 ], we classified the diets as ( i) herbivorous; ( ii) omnivorous - carrion, for species including carrion in their diets; ( iii) omnivorous - insectivorous, for species including insects in their diets; ( iv) ‘ herbivorous ?’- scarce information; or ( v) unknown ( Additional file 1: Table S1 ).

This was done to avoid cases in which infection could have been not detected because the nestlings were too young at the time of sampling thus not giving the parasites time to develop.	"infection	38	47	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""infection"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Odds ratios were calculated to provide a measure of how the probability of infection is predicted to change, for instance when a species has an omnivorous diet compared to a species without an omnivorous diet ( for calculation see Additional file 4 ).	"infection	75	84	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""infection"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Additionally, to allow an adequate evaluation of our results, we simulated the probability that the parasites will actually be detected given the sample size and an expected true prevalence of 0. 08213 based on prevalence data previously reported in wild Psittaciformes ( Additional file 1: Table S1 ).

In the red - fronted parakeet, hemoparasites were detected in samples from Raoul Island and Little Barrier Island, but not on Tiritiri Matangi Island ( New Zealand; Additional file 2: Figure S4; Table 1 ).

Fifteen of the 19 parrot species that we sampled ( 79 %) regularly consume food items that include secondary metabolites known for their antiparasitic activity, including antimalarials, antifungals, leishmanicidals, trypanocidals, anthelmintics, insecticides and mosquitocidals ( Additional file 3: Table S2 ).	"parrot	18	24	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parrot"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
However, red - fronted parakeets consumed a food item known for the presence of secondary metabolites with anthelmintic activity ( Additional file 3: Table S2 ).	"red - fronted parakeets	9	32	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""red - fronted parakeets"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In addition, all 19 studied parrot species consumed items that contained secondary metabolites known for their antimicrobial activity, and 17 species ( 89 %) involved items with antioxidant properties ( Additional file 3: Table S2 ).	"parrot	28	34	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parrot"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
To a lesser extent, some parrots consumed food items containing secondary metabolites recognized for their e. g. antiinflammatory, anticarcinogenic, analgesic, expectorant, or antipyretic effects ( Additional file 3: Table S2 ).	"parrots	25	32	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parrots"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
First, our results appear to support the hypothesis that parrots engaging into self - medication are free from hemoparasites.	"parrots	57	64	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parrots"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
These results suggest that self - medication in parrots may be more widespread than previously thought.	"parrots	48	55	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parrots"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In the case of the white - eyed conure, available data on their diet are limited ( Additional file 3: Table S2) and thus, we may have missed food items that could provide this species with antiparasitic protection.

Nevertheless, results from previous studies lend support to our primary conclusions by demonstrating that some animals deliberately consume food items with prophylactic or therapeutic activity against pathogens or parasites [ 59 – 68 ].

Some of these secondary metabolites may have pharmacological properties and therefore, could contribute to human health care.	"human	107	112	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
However, it is important to mention that to fully test prophylactic anti - parasite self - medication in parrots, further work, particularly experimental research, should be conducted.	"parrots	105	112	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parrots"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Sampling effort bias could also be a reason for the lack of a full association between the diet consumed and the presence of hemoparasites, reinforcing the need of more studies on the foraging ecology of parrots.	"parrots	204	211	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parrots"", ""start_span"": 204, ""end_span"": 211, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Further studies investigating hemoparasites in other parrot species considering their diet might provide the necessary dataset to fully test this hypothesis.	"parrot	53	59	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parrot"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Our comparative analyses including previously published studies also show that parrots living in forests have a higher probability of being infected with hemoparasites than those living in open ( non - forested) habitats.	"parrots	79	86	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""parrots"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This result is in line with previous research showing that avian species breeding in forested habitats have higher hemoparasite prevalences, as revealed for instance in Spanish raptors [ 70 ].	"raptors	177	184	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""raptors"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 184, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
It has been shown that habitats like forests influence the parasite prevalence in the insect vectors, or even the presence of the vectors, which in turn can influence the transmission to avian hosts [ 47 – 50, 54, 70 ].	"insect	86	92	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""insect"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Furthermore, our results suggest that prophylactic anti - parasite self - medication could be a widespread behaviour in animals.	"animals	120	127	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Consequently, both factors acting together may be a valid explanation for the absence of hemoparasites reported in a number of vertebrate species.	"vertebrate	127	137	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""vertebrate"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This result has the potential to trigger new lines of research in search of the mechanism driving hemoparasite infections, such as the investigation of other species living sympatrically with those infected to test if they are free of parasites when ingesting antiparasitic secondary metabolites.

Finally, if the phosphorylation levels were identical in both conditions, we would conclude that FSH has no effect on the reaction.	"FSH	97	100	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FSH"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
We have gathered 28 different experiment types that were used to establish a comprehensive map of the FSHR - induced network4.	"FSHR	102	106	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FSHR"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In this type of experiment, the signal is the molecule Xa ( FSH in our example ), and the corresponding rule is triggered only if Xa has no modified form, as the predicate notModified ( Xa) appears in its premises.

We first built the FSHR induced network, by automatically interpreting a set of experimental results linked to this network, which had been used in a previous review4.	"FSHR	19	23	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FSHR"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

We compared this network to the FSHR induced network that we previously built manually using the same set of experiments4 ( see Supplementary Fig. S1 for an overview of this network ), which will be considered as the reference network.

Most differences observed between the two networks can be explained, either by the fact that in graphical representations some details are omitted for the sake of clarity, or by the presence of knowledge in the reference network transferred from other networks, mostly from signaling networks triggered by other GPCRs.

In particular, experiments involving the use of mutants ( either cells expressing mutant proteins, or even knock - out animals) are often used, but the corresponding rules are delicate to establish, since the driving idea for making a mutation is often implicit.

Child death was also associated with infection and women whose last child had died were twice as likely to be infected.	"infection	37	46	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""infection"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Two factors which may describe risk of HIV acquisition are the number of marriages and the time spent single and sexually active before the first marriage.	"HIV	39	42	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

HIV prevalence and trends	"HIV	0	3	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
HIV prevalence has declined since 2002 in urban clinics but remained stable in the other clinics.	"HIV	0	3	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Another explanation for the difference is that none of the ANC serving Kisesa women offered VCT so all HIV testing was anonymous in 2006.	"HIV	103	106	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The changes in the epidemiology of HIV infection in this region may have minimised differences between the ANC and community based data that arise from geographical variations in prevalence.	"HIV infection	35	48	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HIV infection"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Other differences, such as later childbearing and earlier age at first marriage, may be indicative of behaviour change in response to the HIV epidemic.	"HIV	138	141	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Women seen in ANC in 2006 have grown up surrounded by HIV prevention messages, and it seems likely that these changes in behaviour are real.	"HIV	54	57	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

In short, the women least likely to be infected were those who married soon after first sex and who stayed married although the benefit of marriage may be confined to the early years as indicated by the lower odds of infection experienced by women married for less than one year compared to those who had been married for longer.	"infection	217	226	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""infection"", ""start_span"": 217, ""end_span"": 226, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
This is in keeping with results of similar ANC surveillance from rural Malawi where being in a stable first marriage appears to be protective against HIV infection for young women [ 18 ].

In our analysis the women ' s assessment of her partner ' s fidelity was not predictive of her own HIV status, but half the women were not able to give an answer and we do not know the accuracy of reported assessments.

The close correspondence between the HIV estimates from these data and others suggests that the women in this study are typical of those in the area.	"HIV	37	40	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
However it remains to be seen whether the associations between HIV status and behavioural characteristics in this study are also seen in the wider community.	"HIV	63	66	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
It seems likely that these women had been tested for syphilis on a visit prior to the start of the study.	"syphilis	53	61	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""syphilis"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The women who were seen in VCT - ANC but not planning to take a test were predominantly from the two clinics which had recently introduced testing and were interviewed at the start of the study period when HIV testing had only been underway for a few weeks.

The epidemiology of HIV infection in this region has changed between 2002 and 2006.	"HIV infection	20	33	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HIV infection"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

There is evidence for some behaviour change but given the cross - sectional study design it is not possible to say if the decline in HIV prevalence is related to the changes in behaviour.

On - cell patch - clamp is an electrophysiological technique that is especially powerful for the study of single ion channels on intact cells.	"ion channels	113	125	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ion channels"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
For force studies, patch clamp offers the opportunity to assess the role of the lipid environment on membrane proteins by changing membrane tension or modulating lipid identity.

This is exemplified by recent work from Tolar and colleagues [ 24 ••] who investigated the role of force in the early steps of the humoral immune response that culminates in the generation of high affinity antibodies.	"antibodies	206	216	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""antibodies"", ""start_span"": 206, ""end_span"": 216, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The authors were able to show that BCR: antigen complexes with higher affinities and, therefore, longer lifetimes under force ( measured by DFS experiments using the AFM) showed a greater internalisation of antigen - containing membrane.

If the unfolding pathways in the presence and absence of force are identical ( i. e. there is no force - induced remodelling) then the force - induced off rates, when extrapolated to zero applied force, should be identical to the intrinsic thermally - induced unfolding / unbinding rate, as found for the unbinding of antibody: antigen complexes [ 25 ].	"antibody	318	326	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""antibody"", ""start_span"": 318, ""end_span"": 326, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
This parity is thought to arise due to the presence of a mechanically strong clamp between the complementarity determining region in the antibody domains and the point of force application that prevents any force - induced remodelling of the complex.

For example, Fernandez and colleagues have shown, using AFM force measurements, that the catalytic rate of thioredoxin is force sensitive [ 33] and that this AFM technique can be used to probe catalytic mechanisms [ 34 ].

One notable case is titin which, in addition to its structural role, can act as a strain sensor, triggering muscle adaptation upon detection of mechanical strain.	"titin	20	25	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""titin"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Early in the unfolding process the C - terminal tail of the kinase domain unravels from the remainder of the protein.	"kinase	60	66	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""kinase"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Rognoni et al. [ 37] investigated the mechanical behaviour of the auto - inhibited state and showed that the force - dependent gating characteristics of filamin allow for a cellular response to surprisingly low forces ( the affinity for the C - terminal tail peptides of different interaction partners is increased up to seventeen fold upon increasing applied force from to 2 to 5 pN ).	"filamin	153	160	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""filamin"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 160, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The same authors then showed that switching between the auto - inhibited and activated state is enabled by cis – trans isomerisation of a proline residue in the force sensing domain ( FLNa20 ), weakening the stability of the auto - inhibited state.

The α - helical segments were found to unfold at a much lower force than the Ig domains ( 24 and 83 pN, respectively [ 43 ]) and underwent folding / unfolding transitions at low loading rates.

As this process may involve hydrodynamic shear forces, all of the non - covalent linkages connecting the host to the bacterium must be able to survive force - loading for effective colonisation.

In type I pili, this is achieved by donor strand exchange between inherently mechanically strong Ig - like domains ( Figure 3b) and the unwinding of the helical quaternary structure of the pilus at low force [ 44 – 46 ].

In such a model, the height of the rate limiting transition state for unfolding is governed by the strength of interactions between amino - acids which bear the loaded force.

The outcome for both proteins is similar in that the initial unfolding events expose cryptic binding sites for vinculin ( Figure 3c, d ), a protein that stabilises adhesions, converting force to a biochemical signal. β - sheet proteins, by contrast, are employed if the non - covalent complex is required to resist breakage.	"vinculin	111	119	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""vinculin"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
As described for filamin above, many such interactions are mediated by β - strand augmentation or complementation [ 56 ], whereby a single β - stranded peptide binds to the β - sheet of its partner, forming a mechanically long - lived complex.

Increasing the hydrophobic contacts ( or inter - digitation of side - chains) across this interface increased the mechanical strength of protein L from 134 to 206 pN [ 61 ]. In vitro unfolding studies on simple protein polymers have also shown that the mechanical strength of a protein depends on the direction of force application relative to the topology of the secondary structure.

Examination of the N - terminal sequence of E9 ( through which force or remodelling is applied or carried out in vivo) showed that this region docks against the remainder of the globular domain with little side - chain inter - digitation ( see Figure 4 ).

While single molecule force experiments have been used to investigate the extension of soluble nano - springs and the mechanical stability of membrane proteins [ 88, 89 ], other techniques are required to test the ‘ force - from - lipid ’ principle [ 90 ].

The disease typically presents in the elderly with a generalized pruritic blistering eruption ( 7 – 9 ), which results from an inflammatory associated disruption of the dermal – epidermal junction induced by the binding of autoantibodies onto their targets.

However, clinical presentation of BP can be polymorphic, notably during the early, pre - bullous stage of the disease or in atypical variants, in which full - blown bullous lesions may be absent ( 11, 12 ).

Beside, blisters and erosions arising on mucosal membranes, mainly within the oral cavity, may be observed in up to 20% of BP patients ( 6, 11 – 13 ), without identified pathophysiologic mechanism ( s) associated with their development.

Thus, such specific clinical score may be useful to better characterize those BP patients with associated mucosal involvement and improve their monitoring.	"BP	78	80	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""BP"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Within this subgroup of BP patients, only a correlation tendency was observed with the total BPDAI score ( P = 0. 09) and the skin BPDAI score ( P = 0. 06 ), whereas no correlation could be drawn with the blister / erosion BPDAI score ( P = 0. 30) ( Figures 3E – H, Table 4A ).

Altogether, our results suggest that compared to the classical pathophysiological processes previously defined in BP ( 12, 16, 17, 24, 33 – 36 ), specific immunological mechanisms should be triggered to end with mucosal lesions.	"BP	114	116	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""BP"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In BP patients with mucosal involvement, skin and mucosal lesions are likely to concomitantly occur during the disease process.	"BP	3	5	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""BP"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Actually, there was a broad distribution of total BPDAI score among BP patients with mucosal involvement, but the percentage of patients with mucosal involvement increased along with the BPDAI values ( Figure 1C ).	"BP	50	52	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""BP"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Thus, we can speculate that specific biological / immunological mechanisms responsible for these lesions are activated in those BP patients.	"BP	128	130	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""BP"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

Thus, considering that the number of daily new blisters only displayed a higher tendency in BP patients with mucosal involvement, the highly significant difference in the BPDAI scores associated to blisters and erosions lesions may be related to the presence of erosions rather than to new blisters.

It should be noted, that the W303 genome differs detectably from the S288C reference genome [ 29 ], hence differential sensitivities to the entire removal of wobble uridine modifications are not entirely unexpected.

Consistent with previous reports, elp3 mutants are defective in the formation of mcm5U, mcm5s2U and ncm5U but accumulate s2U, which is not detected in the wild type ( Fig. 1C ), thus reconfirming the notion that U34 thiolation can occur in the absence of mcm5 formation ( Fig. 1A; [ 2 ]).

To test this idea, we introduced a URA3 plasmid carrying the tRNAGln CUG gene into WT and elp3uba4 double mutants and subsequently deleted the single chromosomal gene for tRNAGln CUG.

On FOA medium, the URA3 plasmid - bourne tRNAGln CUG cannot be maintained, resulting in complete growth arrest of WT cells due to the inability of tRNAGln UUG to efficiently decode the CAG codon [ 3 ].

Growth assays further revealed that the elp3uba4 double deletion did not suppress the inviability on FOA medium ( Fig. 2 ), indicating that tRNAGln UUG carrying an unmodified wobble uridine is also inable to efficiently decode the CAG codon.

It remains to be determined whether effects on protein levels are a direct consequence of impaired translational elongation or whether the induction of cell death and additional cellular processes, such as enhanced protein turnover by protein quality control mechanisms or altered protein stabilities contribute to lower protein recovery from wobble uridine modification mutants.

The sizes of the new transcripts mapped in the reference sheep genome ranged from 92 to 14, 775 bp, with an average length of 1172 bp, which is much higher than the average length of 343 bp in our previous report [ 16 ].

Thus, to distinguish between coding and non - coding RNA, with less well - defined species, considerations of genome alignment - based protein - coding prediction are very important for new transcript identification in sheep [ 21, 31 ].

RNA expression profiling in a panel consisting of seven different sheep tissues revealed that 3 of the 20 transcripts are mainly expressed in skeletal muscle ( Fig 5 ).	"sheep	66	71	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""sheep"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The locus XLOC_013968 ( consist of transcript TCONS_00023763 and TCONS_00023764) was identified as a non - coding gene on chromosome 7 and was not yet annotated in the reference sheep genome.	"sheep	178	183	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""sheep"", ""start_span"": 178, ""end_span"": 183, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
It is worth noting that we found no similar sequences in the comparison with the NCBI EST database, which may indicate that TCONS_00023763 and TCONS_00023764 are specifically expressed in ruminants.

In this study we have further explored the relationship between MLL status and GC sensitivity.	"MLL	64	67	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MLL"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
A unique feature of the MLL locus is that it is subject to an extremely wide variety of rearrangements, including translocations with > 50 partner genes on various chromosomes, as well as deletions, inversions, internal duplications and gene amplifications [ 4 - 6 ].	"MLL	24	27	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MLL"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
There are conflicting reports on the relative GC responses of patients with different MLL translocations [ 7, 8 ], but those with t ( 4; 11) translocations appear particularly resistant [ 3, 8, 9 ].	"MLL	86	89	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MLL"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Despite the clinical importance of GCs for the treatment of ALL, detailed knowledge about the transduction pathways leading to GC - induced apoptosis in lymphoid tissues remains limited [ 10 ].	"ALL	60	63	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ALL"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Recently we performed transcriptional profiling of a panel of T - ALL cell lines and reported that GC resistance was associated with a proliferative metabolism [ 11 ].	"ALL	66	69	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ALL"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
We also observed that GC resistance profiles were significantly correlated with reduced expression of MLL.	"MLL	102	105	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MLL"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
This novel finding may help to explain why GC - resistance is a common feature of most patients with MLL - disease despite the wide variety of possible gene rearrangements	"MLL	101	104	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MLL"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

Three pSM2 retroviral RNAi vectors for MLL ( V2HS_196843, V2HS_198375, V2HS_214961) and a non - silencing ( NS) control vector were obtained from Open Biosystems ( Huntsville, USA ).	"MLL	39	42	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MLL"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

We recently examined the baseline resistance of these 15 T - ALL cell lines to the GCs DEX and MPRED [ 12] and correlated the data with gene expression profiles as determined by HG - U133A microarray [ 11 ].

Expression levels measured by qRT - PCR were highly correlated with resistance to both GCs ( Figure 1A; correlation vs. dexamethasone IC50 - 0. 849 ( p < 0. 0001 ), methylprednisolone IC50 - 0. 851 ( p < 0. 0001 )).

This output was analyzed with GSEA to identify the biological networks associated with variations in MLL expression.	"MLL	101	104	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MLL"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

Holleman et al previously examined the ex vivo sensitivity of diagnostic pediatric ALL patient specimens to individual induction therapy agents and correlated the findings with gene expression data measured in the same samples using HG - U133A Affymetrix microarrays [ 17 ].

Although we were not able to directly measure the GC sensitivity of these specimens it is known that almost all patients initially respond to induction therapy and achieve first remission, whilst GC resistance is a well - documented feature of relapse [ 25, 26 ].

This differential was only statistically significant for probe set 212079_s_at ( p < 0. 001, unpaired t - test ), but the same trend was visible for the other four probe sets and is reflected in the summary of the median expression values for all five probes ( Figure 2B ).

By analyzing the data from their study we have ascertained that the expression of MLL was significantly lower in poor - outcome patients ( Group A) compared to those with good outcome ( Figure 3B, bar chart, p = 0. 008 ).

This correlated to a ~ 20% reduction in MLL nuclear protein as assessed by immunoblot ( Figures 4B and 4C, p < 0. 05 ).	"MLL	40	43	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MLL"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

Interestingly, MLL - KD cells showed greater survival following gamma - irradiation indicating resistance to DNA damage ( Figure 5A, p < 0. 05 unpaired t - test ).	"MLL	15	18	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MLL"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Effect of MLL knockdown on cellular resistance, metabolism and GC signaling.	"MLL	10	13	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MLL"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
One interpretation of this data is that alterations in MLL support the proliferative phenotype that we have previously associated with GC resistance [ 11 ].	"MLL	55	58	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MLL"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In addition to suppressing apoptotic potential through the modulation of mitochondrial energetics, up - regulation of biosynthetic and metabolic pathways to support proliferation may therefore confer GC resistance by offsetting the adverse metabolic consequences of GC signalling [ 11 ]. MLL has recently been shown to be important for the control of cell proliferation but the mechanism is complex, involving a bimodal pattern of expression throughout the cell cycle [ 29 ].	"MLL	288	291	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MLL"", ""start_span"": 288, ""end_span"": 291, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Besides energy production, these pathways are essential for the synthesis of macromolecules, nucleotides and nucleic acids required for proliferation [ 30 ].	"nucleotides	93	104	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""nucleotides"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In addition to elevated GC resistance, knockdown of MLL expression was associated with increased resistance to gamma - irradiation indicating an unexpected protection from the effects of DNA - damage.	"MLL	52	55	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MLL"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In contrast however, no protective effect of MLL - knockdown was seen for ARAC or MTX in the present study.	"MLL	45	48	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MLL"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Whilst one might expect that suppression of DNA - damage response pathways should increase resistance to both of these agents, it is interesting to note that, unlike GCs, elevated resistance to neither of these drugs is associated with MLL - rearrangement [ 32, 33 ]; infants in fact are known to be generally more sensitive to ARAC [ 8, 32 ].	"MLL	236	239	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MLL"", ""start_span"": 236, ""end_span"": 239, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
There may therefore be some unexplained insult specificity in the role of MLL in mediating responses to DNA - damage.	"MLL	74	77	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MLL"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Surprisingly the mechanisms controlling expression of wild - type MLL have not been extensively studied, with most work focusing on the downstream effects of the gene and its various fusion products.	"MLL	66	69	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MLL"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
This indicates that allele loss and MLL - translocation are mutually exclusive oncogenic events, but little focus has been given to the regulation of the remaining wild - type allele following translocation.	"MLL	36	39	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MLL"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
This would help to explain why GC - resistance is a common feature of most patients with MLL - disease despite the wide variety of possible gene rearrangements.	"MLL	89	92	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MLL"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Amplifications of the MLL gene do occur but are much more rare.	"MLL	22	25	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MLL"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
We do not propose that the MLL - translocation event itself is without oncogenic effects since this has been clearly demonstrated by other workers, but rather that our data may help to explain the poor - response to therapy in this disease.	"MLL	27	30	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MLL"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Neither do our findings negate the possibility that MLL - fusion proteins themselves may have additional effects upon apoptotic sensitivity.	"MLL	52	55	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MLL"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
However, it is important to note that in these experiments fusion protein constructs were ectopically expressed into cell lines containing wild - type MLL.	"MLL	151	154	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MLL"", ""start_span"": 151, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In view of the evidence discussed here it would be important to know whether expression of endogenous MLL was altered during these experiments and whether this contributed to the observed anti - apoptotic effects.

Increased resistance to DNA damage - induced apoptosis has been proposed as a phenotype of MLL - disease that explains the short latency associated with disease emergence [ 45 ].	"MLL	91	94	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MLL"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

Person - centred methods have been shown to strengthen the sense of “ self ” and identity among those who have dementia ( Crichton & Koch, 2007; Hedman et al ., 2012; Hedman, Hellström, Ternestedt, Hansebo, & Norberg, 2014 ).

Loss of identity, or self, as a result of AD is a temporary loss of one ’ s self ( Sabat, 2001 ), something Edvardsson et al. ( 2008) describe as being a dormant state of the person ’ s “ personhood ”, not a lost one.

For any given ratio of E. coli to Bdellovibrio, the ΔBd0881 strain took longer to reduce light emitted from the luminescent E. coli to half of its maximum, and hence took longer to kill the prey.

Previously we have shown [ 11] that predatory efficiency in liquid media can be affected by the swimming speed of the Bdellovibrio which affects how efficiently they enter areas where they collide with prey.

A comparison of the flagellar lengths of the two strains versus WT, at the exact same growth conditions, revealed that the flagellar filaments of ΔBd0881 were slightly but significantly ( P = 0. 0026 ), shorter than those in wild type Bdellovibrio.

We have previously shown [ 11] that fliC5 deletion shortens flagella and that ΔfliC5 flagellar mutants swim more slowly and prey less efficiently on E. coli in the luminescent prey assay.

Thus having a changed flagellin composition in the ΔBd0743 mutant strains produced a longer flagellum but either it had a “ flaccid ” wave form structure that produced less torque and thus swimming speed, or the ΔBd0743 mutation affected its complement of motor proteins so that the longer flagellum in this strain rotated slower than the wild type.

Surprisingly, predatory efficiency was not affected in our cultures by the slower swimming speed of the ΔBd0743 sigma factor mutant; this is probably indicative of sufficient mixing of predator and prey at close quarters in lab conditions.

The slight increase in flagellar length in ΔBd0743 mutants is likely to have come with the incorporation of a higher percentage of a less rigid flagellin in the flagella causing a less efficient “ bow wave ” and this may account for the slower swimming.

Luminescent prey assays ( with E. coli S17 - 1 containing the plasmid pCL100) were carried out as described elsewhere [ 9, 11] except using a Fluostar Optima machine and the final enumeration data were expressed as Bdellovibrio per E. coli.

Calibration was performed with the software BEAST [ 87 ], considering the mean substitution rates and the standard error of the mean values for 12S, extracted from a fully calibrated phylogeny of Tarentola from the Canary Islands [ 70, 88 ].

Subsequently, the evolutionary history of niche occupancy of each clade of T. mauritanica was reconstructed by merging the SDMs with a published calibrated multilocus phylogeny of the genus Tarentola [ 34 ].

In order to quantify the realized niches of the different clades of Tarentola mauritanica at a geographic scale, we computed a set of multi - temporal variables capturing major annual changes in environmental conditions based on pre - processed monthly variables derived from the MODIS sensors of two NASA satellites and available at http :// www. edenextdata. com.

Occurrence records of the animals from the different clades used to train the SDMs were the same as in Rato et al. [ 34 ], plus six additional specimens of T. angustimentalis from the Canary Islands ( Fuerteventura and Lanzarote) collected in October 2012, used only in our study ( see S2 Table for geographic coordinates and clade assignment ).

From an overall inspection of the environmental tolerance profiles by PC1 and PC2, the general speciation pattern within the Tarentola mauritanica complex, seems to have led to both niche divergence and conservatism.	"Tarentola mauritanica	125	146	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Tarentola mauritanica"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Since there are no fossil records of Tarentola in the Iberian Peninsula from this period [ 69 ], we can only assume that individuals did not cross from North Africa to Europe during the Miocene.	"Tarentola	37	46	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Tarentola"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Later, the separation of the ancestor of Tarentola angustimentalis ( Clade V) took place, when these reached the Eastern Canary Islands ( Lanzarote and Fuerteventura) around 4. 82 Mya, by transmarine dispersal [ 34, 70 ].	"Tarentola angustimentalis	41	66	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Tarentola angustimentalis"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Nonetheless, such a shift may have permitted both clades to cope with the successive expansions and retractions during the Pleistocenic climatic oscillations [ 77, 78] and, more recently, allowed Clade III to colonize ( through human - mediation) other continental and insular regions of the Mediterranean Basin [ 34 ].	"human	228	233	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 228, ""end_span"": 233, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Interestingly, Tarentola responded to the environmental changes during the Miocene resulting in a combination of niche conservatism under unchanged conditions and niche shift to newly arisen habitats ( e. g. [ 79 ]).	"Tarentola	15	24	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Tarentola"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
During the glaciations, Tarentola populations probably survived in Iberia in various isolated “ microclimate pockets ” [ 80 ], which is in agreement with the “ refugia - within - refugia ” model, hypothesized for the Iberian Peninsula ( but see [ 81 ], e. g. [ 82 ]).	"Tarentola	24	33	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Tarentola"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Taking into account that individuals of Tarentola are frequently associated with humanized habitats, and their accidental introductions are common [ 38 ], especially around the Mediterranean, we would expect other clades to be introduced in Europe as well.	"Tarentola	40	49	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Tarentola"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
According to the results from this study, the diversification of the clades within the Tarentola mauritanica species - complex fits both the niche divergence and conservatism profiles, with individuals of some clades still maintaining a realized niche distinct from their relatives.

Likewise, the niche evolution study and overlap patterns of the European / North African clade corroborate that climatic variables related to humidity and temperature seasonality ( and hence, natural selection) resulted in the divergence of this clade and to the maintenance of the individuals in a realized niche distinct from the remaining members of Tarentola mauritanica.

Based on these results, the upper bounds for prevalence of the E211K variant was estimated to be extremely low, less than 1 in 2000 cattle ( Bayesian analysis based on 95% quantile of the posterior distribution with a uniform prior ).

Background: Subjective cognitive impairments are frequent, but poorly understood in patients with chronic fatigue.	"cognitive impairments	23	44	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cognitive impairments"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Patients completed questionnaires about metacognitive beliefs, somatic complaints, psychological complaints, and cognitive impairments before and after treatment.

Targeting metacognitive beliefs could prove an effective therapeutic intervention for subjective cognitive impairments in these patients.

One of several criteria for fulfilling a CFS case definition is reporting problems with forgetfulness, increased distractibility, and reduced mental alertness ( Fukuda et al ., 1994; Jason et al ., 2004 ).	"CFS	41	44	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""CFS"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
These subjective cognitive complaints or impairments are part of all popular CFS classifications ( Holmes et al ., 1988; Sharpe et al ., 1991) making them a hallmark of the disorder ( Jason et al ., 2004 ).	"CFS	77	80	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""CFS"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Their importance is underlined by 90% of CFS patients rating problems with memory and concentration as a primary concern ( Jason et al ., 1999 ).	"CFS	41	44	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""CFS"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
As an example, performance differences between CFS patients and controls are reported on the modified Paced Auditory Serial Attention Test, but not for a simple number recognition task ( Cook et al ., 2007 ).	"CFS	47	50	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""CFS"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Subjective cognitive impairments on the other hand, are consistently reported ( Cockshell and Mathias, 2014 ).	"cognitive impairments	11	32	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cognitive impairments"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Within CFS, mental fatigue has documented effects on attention, working memory, and other executive control processes ( Boksem and Tops, 2008 ).	"CFS	7	10	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""CFS"", ""start_span"": 7, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
However, such linking of subjective and objective cognitive functioning in CFS is controversial and not straightforward ( Cockshell and Mathias, 2014 ).	"CFS	75	78	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""CFS"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The concept of metacognitions has become increasingly popular in psychotherapy research, also within CFS ( Fernie et al ., 2015 ).	"CFS	101	104	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""CFS"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Moreover, a study investigating such selective attention show CFS patients having a significant bias toward health - threatening information ( Hou et al ., 2008 ).	"CFS	62	65	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""CFS"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The theoretical model outlining the development and maintenance of CAS is the Self - Regulatory Executive Function ( S - REF) model ( Wells and Matthews, 1996; Wells, 2011 ).	"CAS	67	70	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""CAS"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Investigating subjective cognitive impairments in chronic fatigue and whether these are associated with dysfunctional metacognitive beliefs, may further our understanding and treatment of these complaints.	"cognitive impairments	25	46	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cognitive impairments"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
As of now, there are no studies investigating this association, but one study showcased the potential relevance of maladaptive metacognitive beliefs in patients with CFS ( Fernie et al ., 2015 ).	"CFS	166	169	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""CFS"", ""start_span"": 166, ""end_span"": 169, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Several promising treatment manuals for metacognitive therapy exist, which could easily be adapted to fit CFS, either as a stand - alone therapy, or as an addition to graded exercise therapy or traditional cognitive therapy.

The main aim of this study is to investigate the association of metacognitive beliefs to subjective cognitive impairments in a population reporting chronic fatigue.	"cognitive impairments	100	121	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cognitive impairments"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Moreover, we hypothesize that maladaptive metacognitive beliefs at the start of treatment will predict subjective cognitive impairments at treatment end.	"cognitive impairments	114	135	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cognitive impairments"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
We also hypothesize that a reduction in maladaptive metacognitive beliefs during treatment is associated with less subjective cognitive impairments at treatment termination, controlling for the aforementioned symptoms.

Next, we performed a third hierarchical regression model testing the associations of the five subscales of MCQ - 30 ( cognitive confidence, need to control thoughts, positive beliefs, danger / uncontrollability and cognitive consciousness) with subjective cognitive impairments.

This is the first study to report associations between maladaptive metacognitive beliefs and subjective cognitive impairments in chronically fatigued patients.	"cognitive impairments	104	125	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cognitive impairments"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Investigating the subscales of MCQ - 30, only the scale asking beliefs about cognitive confidence had pre - treatment scores associated with pre - treatment subjective cognitive impairments.	"cognitive impairments	168	189	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cognitive impairments"", ""start_span"": 168, ""end_span"": 189, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
This was also the case for a reduction in post - treatment values on the cognitive confidence subscale, indicating that this subscale is particularly relevant in subjective cognitive impairments.	"cognitive impairments	173	194	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cognitive impairments"", ""start_span"": 173, ""end_span"": 194, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Indeed, maladaptive metacognitive beliefs about cognitive confidence have been previously been associated with symptom severity in CFS patients ( Fernie et al ., 2015 ).	"CFS	131	134	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""CFS"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
It is not unlikely then that this association with symptom severity is related to patients ' subjective cognitive impairments.	"cognitive impairments	104	125	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cognitive impairments"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Previous data have shown that CFS patient ' s objective cognitive abilities will vary over a span of 10 weeks ( Fuentes et al ., 2001 ).	"CFS	30	33	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""CFS"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
This would potentially alleviate a concern that 90% of CFS patients rate as primary and debilitating.	"CFS	55	58	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""CFS"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The main finding in this study was that a reduction in dysfunctional metacognitive beliefs during treatment was associated with less subjective cognitive impairments at treatment termination.	"cognitive impairments	144	165	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cognitive impairments"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 165, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
While depressive symptoms and anxiety also showed a significant association with subjective cognitive complaints in the current study population, they did not influence the unique association with maladaptive metacognitive beliefs.	"anxiety	30	37	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""anxiety"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
However, the reported relationship between depressive symptoms, anxiety, and subjective cognitive complaints does add a second argument for investigating metacognitions further.	"anxiety	64	71	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""anxiety"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Thus, the participants ' results may not be generalizable to the group of patients who meet the full diagnostic criteria for CFS.	"CFS	125	128	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""CFS"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
However, the mean pre - treatment scores on Chalder Fatigue Scale are in line with other studies of patients with diagnosed CFS ( White et al ., 2011 ), and systematic reviews have argued that symptom measures are the best way to evaluate interventions in chronic fatigue ( Brurberg et al ., 2014 ).	"CFS	124	127	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""CFS"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
It is also a limitation that subjective cognitive impairments were assessed by a questionnaire not an semi - structured interview, however, this is a common way of estimating such impairments.

Finally, our results give cause to investigate metacognitive therapy as a potential supplemental or novel psychological treatment for CFS.	"CFS	134	137	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""CFS"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
General psychological strain did not decrease significantly in FNSD patients.	"FNSD	63	67	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""FNSD"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Changes in emotion regulation in FNSD patients were constrained to an increase in self - reported use of cognitive reappraisal strategies.	"FNSD	33	37	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""FNSD"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Further clarification of emotion processing in FNSD should inform concepts and therapeutic procedures.	"FNSD	47	51	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""FNSD"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Altered emotion regulation was verified as stronger tendency for emotion suppression and less cognitive reappraisal in FNSD patients than in healthy controls ( 13 ).	"FNSD	119	123	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""FNSD"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Hemodynamic and electromagnetic imaging studies confirmed altered processing of emotional stimuli and emotion regulation in FNSD compared to controls in those frontocortical and parietal cortices that have been related to emotion regulation ( 14, 15 ).	"FNSD	124	128	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""FNSD"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In addition to frontal abnormality, augmented activity in movement - related cortical areas was reported for patients with conversion disorder compared to controls ( 16 – 19 ).	"conversion disorder	123	142	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""conversion disorder"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Similarly, Fiess et al. ( 18) reported less frontocortical but augmented sensorimotor electromagnetic activity in FNSD compared to controls in an emotion regulation task, in which participants implemented cognitive reappraisal strategies when watching unpleasant stimuli.	"FNSD	114	118	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""FNSD"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Thus, variation with treatment may test hypotheses on the role of emotion regulation in FNSD.	"FNSD	88	92	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""FNSD"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In addition, the indices of emotion processing were examined before and after a standard clinical treatment program for FNSD that addressed emotion regulation, emotional conflict awareness, and analysis and resolution of learned stimulus - symptom contingencies as potential contribution to symptom generation.

"FNSD	170	174	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""FNSD"", ""start_span"": 170, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Functional neurological symptom disorder patients reported higher FNS severity ( SDQ - 20: U = 48. 5, p < 0. 00) and higher psychological strain ( SCL - 90R: U = 22, p < 0. 00) than HC.	"Functional neurological symptom disorder	0	40	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Functional neurological symptom disorder"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Group - specific relationships were confirmed for TAS - 26 – SCL - 90R GSI ( r = 0. 65, p = 0. 003) in FNSD patients.	"FNSD	103	107	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""FNSD"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Bonferroni – Holm adjusted effects confirmed significant changes over time / treatment only for increased use of cognitive reappraisal strategies in FNSD patients [ ERQ - R, t ( 16) = − 3. 9, p = 0. 001, here, the significant alpha - level after Bonferroni – Holm correction should be p < 0. 0035 ], which did not differ from that in HC at the second assessment ( U = 129, p = 0. 3 ).	"FNSD	149	153	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""FNSD"", ""start_span"": 149, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
A slight decrease in symptom severity [ SDQ - 20, t ( 16) = 0. 135, p = 0. 9, following Bonferroni – Holm correction p < 0. 05 would have been needed to reach significance ], and psychological strain [ SCL - 90R from pre M ± SD. 66 ± 0. 48 to posttreatment M ± SD = 0. 87 ± 0. 5; t ( 16) = 0. 14, p = 0. 018, Bonferroni – Holm corrected p < 0. 004 would have been needed] in FNSD patients did not reach significance.	"FNSD	375	379	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""FNSD"", ""start_span"": 375, ""end_span"": 379, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Hence, both symptom severity and psychological strain remained higher in FNSD than in HC ( SDQ - 20: U = 45. 5, p < 0. 001 SCL - 90R: U = 46. 5, p < 0. 001) at the second assessment.

In FNSD patients, no significant changes can be reported for subjective symptom report [ t ( 16) = 2. 1, p = 0. 05, Bonferroni – Holm corrected p < 0. 007 would have been needed ].	"FNSD	3	7	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""FNSD"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Similarly, alexithymia [ t ( 16) = 1. 37, p = 0. 19, adjusted p, 0. 01] and emotion suppression [ t ( 16) = − 0. 45, p = 0. 66, adjusted alpha - level: p = 0. 02] did not vary with treatment and changes in symptom severity were not related with changes in emotion processing in FSND patients.

Figure 2 illustrates the time - course of event - related alpha power decrease across a 3 - s baseline and 2 - s stimulus interval separately for groups and conditions: In the pretreatment assessment, greater alpha power decrease during UW ( watch unpleasant stimuli) than NW ( watch neutral) trials characterized the “ emotion effect ” on sensor and source level in both groups ( HC: p < 0. 001, FNSD patients: p < 0. 01 ).	"FNSD	397	401	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""FNSD"", ""start_span"": 397, ""end_span"": 401, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In the same time interval, the “ regulation effect ” was evident in both groups in marked alpha power decrease during UR compared to UW condition on sensor level ( HC: p < 0. 01; FNSD patients: p < 0. 01 ).	"FNSD	179	183	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""FNSD"", ""start_span"": 179, ""end_span"": 183, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
However, within the FNSD sample, changes of the “ regulation effect ” across time varied with changes in the subjectively rated symptom severity ( r = 0. 52, p = 0. 02) in that larger ( post - minus pre treatment) changes in power between the conditions “ watch unpleasant ” and “ regulate unpleasant ” varied with larger changes in experienced symptom severity.	"FNSD	20	24	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""FNSD"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The present study evaluated indices of emotion regulation in relation to FNS by comparing these indices between FNSD patients and healthy controls and their variation with time and / or treatment.	"FNSD	112	116	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""FNSD"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In addition, cortical correlates of “ emotion ” and “ regulation ” effects were replicated ( 18 ), whereas frontal and more sensorimotor cortex involvement in emotion regulation in FNSD patients ( 16, 18) was not replicated.

Moreover, results on cortical emotion regulation indices indicated their stability, but did not vary with treatment in FNSD patients.	"FNSD	119	123	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""FNSD"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

To investigate these questions we have used BJ cells as a reversible model of senescence and show that HPV - 16 can only infect early - passage proliferating cells.

During the process of endocytic maturation and acidification the capsid begins to disassemble, and at some point in this process the L2 proteins become partially exposed to the cytoplasmic side of the endocytic vesicle13, 14.

However, transfection of a p53 siRNA, the efficacy of which was verified by Western blotting in Fig. 1b, efficiently reverses the senescent phenotype, and as can be seen from the EdU incorporation assay in Fig. 1c and d these cells re - enter the cell cycle and activate DNA replication.

As can be seen from Fig. 2b, early passage BJ cells are efficiently transduced using the HPV - 16 PsVs but the late passage senescent cells are not, which is consistent with their not undergoing cell division.

Note that only early passage untreated BJ cells are efficiently transduced using the HPV - 16 PsVs, while untreated late passage ( senescent) cells are not.	"HPV - 16	85	93	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HPV - 16"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Note that late passage ( senescent) cells are only efficiently transduced if stimulated to re - enter the cell cycle through p53 siRNA transfection.	"p53	125	128	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""p53"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
To do this, late passage BJ cells were exposed to HPV - 16 PsVs, and after 24 h the cells were washed and medium replaced.	"HPV - 16	50	58	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HPV - 16"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The cells were then cultured for 13 days and 27 days, after which they were transfected with the p53 siRNA to promote cell cycle re - entry.	"p53	97	100	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""p53"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
However, if the cells are exposed 27 days prior to transfection of the p53 siRNA, then no PsV transduction occurs ( Fig. 3b ).	"p53	71	74	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""p53"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
This indicates that wherever the incoming HPV - 16 PsVs reside for these extended periods of time in the senescent cells, they can remain viable and capable of transducing the reporter construct upon stimulation of cell cycle re - entry for at least 2 weeks, but most likely for no longer than 4 weeks.

One day after siRNA transfection, AF488 - labelled HPV - 16 PsVs ( green) were added to the cells.	"HPV - 16	51	59	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HPV - 16"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
HPV infectious entry involves a complex series of steps, which includes interaction with extracellular matrix, structural remodelling of the virion, and receptor attachment, followed by endocytosis and the recruitment of different components of the cellular transport machinery to ensure delivery of the incoming viral genomes to the trans - Golgi network35.	"HPV	0	3	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HPV"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Upon entry into mitosis, the nuclear envelope is lost and the viral L2 / DNA complex gains access to the nucleus where it resides in PODs and where initiation of viral gene expression then takes place7, 8.	"L2	68	70	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""L2"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In particular, how long can the incoming HPVs remain viable within the infected cell prior to the onset of mitosis and where do they reside during this period?	"HPVs	41	45	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HPVs"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Using a well - established model of reversible cell senescence31, we have been able to show that incoming HPV - 16 PsVs can remain viable for up to 13 days post - exposure to the target cells, and can efficiently transduce cells after such a period of time if the cells are stimulated to re - enter the cell cycle.	"HPV - 16	106	114	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HPV - 16"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
However, cell cycle re - entry can be efficiently induced in these senescent cells following transfection of a p53 siRNA.	"p53	111	114	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""p53"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Using this model of inducible cell cycle re - entry, we first investigated how long HPV - 16 PsVs could remain infectious after being exposed to the cells, but prior to the cells undergoing mitosis.	"HPV - 16	84	92	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HPV - 16"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Obviously, a major question arising from this analysis was; where within the cell does the virus reside whilst the cell is in a senescent state for these extended periods of time?	"virus	91	96	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""virus"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We provide strong evidence that under these circumstances, HPV - 16 PsVs do not actually enter an internal vesicular compartment, but remain attached to the cell surface.	"HPV - 16	59	67	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HPV - 16"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Indeed, in the senescent cells there was consistent indication of AF488 - labelled HPV - 16 PsVs accumulating on the cell surface.	"HPV - 16	83	91	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HPV - 16"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Obviously, these studies have the caveat of being performed in fibroblasts and not in basal keratinocytes, the natural target cell for these viruses.	"viruses	141	148	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""viruses"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Which signalling pathways, or types of endocytic transport, are so linked to the cell cycle and virus entry will be a subject of future study.	"virus	96	101	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""virus"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Finally these studies also highlight that HPV - 16 PsVs are remarkably stable when bound to their target cell, and can remain infectious for several weeks.	"HPV - 16	42	50	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HPV - 16"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This suggests that, from a virological perspective, residing in an internal vesicular compartment for extended periods of time is not compatible with virus survival, but rather, being bound to the cell surface and primed to enter the cell upon the receipt of appropriate growth - promoting signals is most favourable.

Whereas the majority of children in Timika are likely to have been infected with P. vivax by the age of 5 years ( and therefore have started to acquire immunity early in life ), fewer than one in ten children could be expected to have been infected with P. malariae by the same age ( based on an estimated annual incidence of 15. 7 cases per 1, 000 persons in 2005) [ 20 ].

The position and the depth of the two molecules inside the bilayer can be investigated by measuring the relative quenching of the fluorescence of the Trp residue by the probes 11, 12 - Br - PC, 9, 10 - Br - PC, and 6, 7 - Br - PC, which differ in the position of the quencher moiety along the hydrocarbon chain.

The values of Kp ( 4. 3 104) obtained are within the range of those obtained for membrane - permeating bioactive peptides and its high value indicates that the tryptophans of gH625 - dendrimer are embedded in the bilayer.

This unfavorable entropy change may be attributed to the conformational change of gH625 from an unordered structure in aqueous solution to an ordered α - helix upon interaction with the membrane as previously shown by circular dichroism data in membrane mimetic environment [ 22] and as reported in literature for other peptides [ 55 ], [ 56 ].

The peptide gH625 has been previously characterized [ 16 ], [ 17 ], [ 18 ], indicating its strong interaction with LUVs without the formation of pores inside the bilayer, therefore able to reduce toxicity problems.

All the results from the complementary techniques such as fluorescence spectroscopy, surface plasmon resonance and isothermal calorimetry, obtained in this contribution, indicate that the gH625 - dendrimer has a high affinity for the membrane bilayer; moreover, we were able to determine via tryptophan quenching experiments with Br - PC that the molecule is deeply inserted inside the bilayer.

These data further support the view that the mechanism of lipid association plays a key role in the translocation activity and the hypothesis that gH625 - dendrimer cellular uptake is associated with its ability to interact with membrane lipids and to temporarily affect membrane organization, thereby facilitating insertion into the membrane and translocation.

Mass mortality incidents that involve multiple wild birds attract considerable public concern and media attention.	"birds	52	57	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""birds"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Physical causes of mortalities of multiple wild birds include blunt trauma ( due to e. g. road traffic accidents, power line collisions, air strikes, predator attacks or disorientation following fireworks or sonic booms) 8 and adverse weather ( hail storms, thunderstorms, lightning) 91011.	"birds	48	53	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""birds"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In Great Britain ( GB ), this species has undergone a population decline of over 50% since 1964; the current population is estimated at 3. 4 million birds during the breeding season1213.	"birds	149	154	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""birds"", ""start_span"": 149, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
There have been few studies of the causes of morbidity and mortality of starlings in GB and these have focused on non - infectious causes including predation, road traffic incidents, shot injury, falling down chimneys and food shortage1415.	"starlings	72	81	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""starlings"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In contrast, several incidents of mortality involving multiple starlings have been reported in GB due to poisoning27 and physical trauma ( e. g. air strike28, road traffic collisions29 ); the latter is often thought to occur as a result of their flocking behaviour.	"starlings	63	72	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""starlings"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Whilst wild passerines found dead in water bodies are likely to have drowned, pathological examinations are required to exclude alternative causes of death, such as trauma or poisoning, or to determine if the carcass ( es) had been immersed in water after death.	"passerines	12	22	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""passerines"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

However, confirmation of drowning on post - mortem examination ( PME) is often problematic since none of these signs may be present, many of them are transient and only detected in freshly dead animals and some may occur with carcass immersion following death.	"animals	194	201	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 194, ""end_span"": 201, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
There was a seasonal peak during the spring ( May - June) in these reports that was mirrored in recoveries due to other traumatic causes of mortality ( e. g. fallen down chimney, killed by cat ).

For the purposes of this study, a drowning incident was defined as one where one or more starling carcasses were recovered from water and where the history, PME findings and diagnostic tests performed were consistent with drowning and provided no alternative likely cause of death.

The British and Irish Ringing Scheme, which began in 1909, is organised by the British Trust for Ornithology ( BTO) with licensed ringers marking approximately 800, 000 wild birds of a wide species range each year37.

Approximately 15, 000 of the ringed birds are subsequently reported each year, either dead or alive, by members of the public or other volunteers, with information including the date and place of finding, an estimate of age in some cases and a description of the circumstances of finding.

Whilst a full suite of tests was not performed on birds from each incident, our investigations revealed no evidence for a toxic, infectious or traumatic ( other than drowning) cause of death.	"birds	50	55	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""birds"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

This might lead to reporting bias: multiple dead birds are both more likely to be seen and more likely to be reported than individual drownings.	"birds	49	54	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""birds"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

That a single species, the starling, was involved in each of the reported multiple drowning incidents supports a species - specific behavioural cause.	"starling	27	35	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""starling"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Whilst adult starlings were reported to be involved in a small number of reported incidents, the majority comprised only juveniles.	"starlings	13	22	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""starlings"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Starling drowning incidents occurred in May and June, following the fledging of first broods and their progression to parental independence44.	"Starling	0	8	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Starling"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Following emergence from the nest, juvenile starlings have a period of high risk, whilst they learn to become independent from their parents.	"starlings	44	53	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""starlings"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Most of the starling drowning incidents involved still water which, depending on the light and aspect, might have resulted in a reflective appearance suggestive of a solid surface.	"starling	12	20	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""starling"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In one incident ( incident 12, Table S1 ), starlings continued to attempt to enter the water body once the majority of its surface had been deliberately covered over.	"starlings	43	52	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""starlings"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
At least three birds drowned once the water body had been partially covered.	"birds	15	20	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""birds"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Consequently, birds may have found it difficult to exit these water bodies.	"birds	14	19	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""birds"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Climate has been proposed as a predisposing factor for vulture drowning incidents since they occur most frequently in arid regions where lack of water availability might promote reliance on anthropogenic sources ( e. g. livestock troughs) 49.	"vulture	55	62	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""vulture"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In incident 12 from the current study, a recent heatwave was reported and the starlings were noted to continue to try and access the water source over a period of several days, therefore thirst may have been a factor.	"starlings	78	87	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""starlings"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Whilst details of the weather were not available for the majority of the probable drowning incidents in British starlings, thirst seems an unlikely common primary driver given the typically wet British spring climate.

That recurrent starling mortality due to drowning, rather than a single drowning episode, was observed at three of the sites in this study might indicate increased risk of occurrence associated with particular site features.

Such information might inform appropriate mitigation measures that can be adopted, for example the use of floating structures or ramps that could be used to assist birds to escape from water bodies, particularly during the period of high risk ( May - June ).

The second strategy is the elaboration of a specialised mucin - rich surface coat; this is loosely attached to the parasite epicuticle in a fashion that permits rapid escape when host antibodies and cells adhere, resulting in an inflammatory reaction around a newly vacated focus.	"mucin	56	61	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""mucin"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The mucins have been characterised as bearing multiple glycan side - chains, consisting of a blood - group - like trisaccharide with one or two O - methylation modifications.	"mucins	4	10	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""mucins"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Antibodies to the mono - methylated trisaccharide appear to be T. canis - specific, as this epitope is not found in the closely related Toxocara cati, but all other antigenic determinants are very similar between the two species.	"Toxocara cati	136	149	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Toxocara cati"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Further tools to control toxocariasis could also arise from understanding the molecular cues and steps involved in larval development. In vitro - cultivated larvae express high levels of four mRNAs that are translationally silenced, as the proteins they encode are not detectable in cultured larvae.	"toxocariasis	25	37	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""toxocariasis"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Secondly, the larval stage is able to enter a long - term developmental arrest, which allows it to suspend life cycle progression whilst in a paratenic host, and to resume maturation to the adult stage only once reaching a canid species.

Thirdly, even in female canids, developmental arrest occurs so that larvae can dwell in tissues until pregnancy occurs, and then migrate transplacentally or via colostrum to infect the foetal or newborn pup ( Schnieder et al ., 2011 ).	"canids	24	30	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""canids"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
T. canis is highly prevalent in all canid populations that are not treated regularly with anthelmintics, and its infectivity to wild species renders elimination almost impossible.	"canid	36	41	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""canid"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Pathogens are recognised initially by the innate immune system reacting to intrinsically foreign molecular signatures associated with xenogeneic species, such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide, unmethylated DNA and fungal carbohydrates.	"carbohydrates	220	233	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""carbohydrates"", ""start_span"": 220, ""end_span"": 233, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The major feature of this adaptive immune response is production of T. canis - specific antibodies, associated with CD4 + T - helper type 2 cell ( Th2) activity ( Del Prete et al ., 1991 ).	"CD4	116	119	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
T cell responses to T. canis in human beings are clearly of the Th2 type, and are stimulated by the “ excretory – secretory ” ( ES) antigens of the parasite ( Del Prete et al ., 1991 ).	"human	32	37	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Recently, the distinction between innate and adaptive arms of immunity has become much more blurred with identification of innate lymphoid cells, which can rapidly produce Type - 2 cytokines ( Neill et al ., 2010) without requiring activation by dendritic cells ( Smith et al ., 2012 ).	"Type - 2 cytokines	172	190	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Type - 2 cytokines"", ""start_span"": 172, ""end_span"": 190, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
There are now extensive data on the seroprevalence of anti - TES antibodies in human populations around the world, using the established ELISA.	"human	79	84	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Hence widespread toxocariasis remains of great concern in most parts of the world.	"toxocariasis	17	29	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""toxocariasis"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Although almost all immunological studies on T. canis have centred a round the tissue - migrating larvae, the immune response of the final canid host to intestinal adult worms is also of central importance.	"canid	139	144	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""canid"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
A long - term aim of research in this area is to develop an effective vaccine against canine toxocariasis, which ideally would build immunity to both tissue - and intestinal stages of the parasite.

To date, attempts to generate protective anti - larval immunity in laboratory rodents have had mixed results.	"rodents	78	85	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""rodents"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Likewise, a more recent study found no evidence of protection by administering a second challenge of larvae to previously infected mice, other than they were more likely to sequester in the brain ( Kolbeková et al ., 2011 ).	"mice	131	135	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
However, it is important to recognise that T. canis is adapted to its definitive host rather than to intermediate or accidental hosts such as the human, and in the maladapted setting, the host may react more vigorously and pathologically.	"human	146	151	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Notably, when N. brasiliensis is introduced to IL - 5T mice in the presence of T. canis ES antigens ( see below ), their survival is greatly enhanced ( Giacomin et al ., 2008 ).	"mice	55	59	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
These observations of shedding cells bound to the parasite surface have an interesting link to electron microscopic observations of a labile surface coat from the larval parasite, distal to and separated from the nematode cuticle.

It is likely that both local and systemic effects of parasite infection on host immunity are mediated by secreted products, such as the TES antigens.

Within TES, the molecular components were first described by their molecular weight on SDS - PAGE analysis, with major bands evident at 26, 32, 45, 55, 70, 120 and 400 kDa ( Maizels et al ., 1984 ); even at this stage the extensive overlap between surface proteins and those in TES was clear.	"surface proteins	248	264	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""surface proteins"", ""start_span"": 248, ""end_span"": 264, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Subsequent studies of TES used 1 - and 2 - dimensional SDS - PAGE to more precisely classify components ( Badley et al ., 1987b; Meghji and Maizels, 1986 ), together with techniques such as biosynthetic labelling with radioactive amino acids ( Page and Maizels, 1992; Sugane et al ., 1985 ).

Histological sections of liver from infected mice also showed that TES is released from larvae in vivo ( Parsons et al ., 1986 ).	"mice	45	49	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Over subsequent years, a combination of peptide sequencing ( Loukas et al ., 1999b ), monoclonal antibody binding ( Bowman et al ., 1993; Maizels et al ., 1987) and recombinant DNA techniques ( Gems et al ., 1995; Gems and Maizels, 1996; Maizels et al ., 2000) has characterised three sets of TES proteins and glycoproteins ( TES - 26, - 32 / 70 and - 120) while the other components remain to be fully characterised.

A near - identical sequence was later described by an independent group as a proteoglycan core protein ( Yamasaki et al ., 1998 ).	"proteoglycan core protein	77	102	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""proteoglycan core protein"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

Initial chemical analysis of TES revealed a high content of galactose and N - acetylgalactosamine, amounting to ∼ 40% by total weight of the secreted products ( Meghji and Maizels, 1986 ).	"galactose	60	69	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""galactose"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The original reports from De Savigny ( de Savigny and Tizard, 1977; de Savigny et al ., 1979) provided a breakthrough for immuno - diagnosis of toxocariasis, as the sensitivity and specificity of TES in assays such as ELISA and Western Blot proved to be far superior to use of whole worm extracts ( Van Knapen et al ., 1983 ).	"toxocariasis	144	156	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""toxocariasis"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Nevertheless, the sensitivity and specificity of TES - based immunodiagnostic tests vary around the 90% level, and there are concerns that the presence of blood group - like or other cross - reactive carbohydrates could be responsible for a number of false - positive results ( Smith et al ., 1984, 2009 ).

While none of the antigens individually showed 100% specificity, a combination of the three was able to detect all samples serologically reactive to native TES, and showed cross - reactivity with only 2 – 4% of serum samples from other infections ( Mohamad et al ., 2009 ).

In the last few years, a new class of biological regulatory molecules has been defined with the discovery of small (∼ 22 - nucleotide) RNA species which bind to and inhibit translation of target mRNAs and mediate their degradation within the cell.

Abundant miRNAs have been described in several nematode species ( Chen et al ., 2011; Poole et al ., 2010; Winter et al ., 2012 ), most notably the free - living worm C. elegans, which provides well - characterised conserved sequences such as let - 7 ( Ambros et al ., 2003; Hammell et al ., 2009 ).

Within the 3 ′ UTR tracts of each transcript were motifs similar to those targeted in C. elegans by let - 7, and when the 3 ′ UTR of a T. canis ANT gene was inserted downstream of a GFP construct in transgenic C. elegans, suppression of gene expression was achieved ( Callister et al ., 2008 ).

In addition, in exudative AMD, changes in the choriocapillaris may occur before changes in the RPE, and could be the primary cause of sub - retinal neovascularization [ 6 ].	"AMD	26	29	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AMD"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
A number of histological and electron micrograph corrosion casting studies also show choriocapillaris degeneration associated with diabetes [ 3 ], [ 12 ]–[ 15 ].

Combined with conventional depth - resolved structural imaging capabilities of OCT, OCT angiography promises to be a powerful tool to visualize and investigate the outer retinal layers and choriocapillaris comprehensively in retinal diseases.

Eight normal volunteers ( mean age 33. 0 ± 11. 1 years, range 24 to 54 years) without any known history of retinal diseases participated in the study.

As in the choriocapillaris, the density of feeding and draining vessels tend to decrease and the vessel diameter increase at fundus locations away from the central fovea. Figures 3J and 3K, adapted from Olver et al. [ 29 ], show electron micrograph corrosion casts of the human choriocapillaris at the posterior pole and equator, respectively, which are displayed in the same scale as in the OCT angiograms for comparison.

Sohrab et al. also studied the choriocapillaris and larger choroidal vessel patterns with commercial SDOCT in patients with early AMD or reticular pseudo - drusen [ 32 ].	"AMD	130	133	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AMD"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
It should be noted, however, that severe astigmatism would likely reduce the transverse resolution and signal in OCT angiography.	"astigmatism	41	52	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""astigmatism"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Furthermore, in AMD patients with irregular RPE contours, a more sophisticated segmentation algorithm would be required to segment the choriocapillaris boundary accurately.	"AMD	16	19	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AMD"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The major difference between this technique and fluorescein or ICG angiography is that OCT angiography is based on motion contrast.	"fluorescein	48	59	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""fluorescein"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
This is an interesting property, since it suggests that OCT angiography may detect abnormalities in local perfusion before structural abnormalities such as vessel atrophy occur, which could be useful for early diagnosis.	"atrophy	163	170	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""atrophy"", ""start_span"": 163, ""end_span"": 170, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Unlike fluorescein or ICG angiography, OCT angiography does not detect dye leakage, which is beneficial for imaging the fenestrated choriocapillaris, but is limited in applications where alterations in vascular permeability are markers of disease.

Clinical imaging studies on patients with retinal disease as well as age - matched normal subjects are required in order to assess the ultimate clinical utility of OCT angiography of the choriocapillaris.	"retinal disease	42	57	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""retinal disease"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
More extensive clinical imaging studies on patients with retinal disease and age - matched normal subjects are required in order to assess the ultimate utility of OCT angiographic imaging of the choriocapillaris.	"retinal disease	57	72	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""retinal disease"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Since alterations in choriocapillaris structure are implicated in many retinal diseases, OCT angiography promises to enable cross - sectional as well as longitudinal studies in patients for a better understanding of pathogenesis, early diagnosis of diseases, treatment response monitoring, and improved efficiency of pharmaceutical development.

Although this initial study is based on a relatively small sample size, decreases in specific cytokines suggest down regulations of both pro - inflammatory and immunoprotective responses to play a role in this disease.

Two ( 11 %) of the KC patients were graded as mild ( steepest K < 45D ), 6 ( 33 %) as moderate ( 45D ≤ steepest K ≤ 52D ), and 10 ( 56 %) as severe ( steepest K > 52D ).	"KC	19	21	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""KC"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Using the Mann - Whitney test, there was a statistically significant ( p = 0. 02 ), 10 year difference in the mean age between the controls and the keratoconus subjects, who were on average 33 and 43 years old, respectively.

Although matching by contact lens use would not per se remove this difference, to determine if contact lens use had an effect, irrespective of disease status, we fit a multivariate linear model to determine the effects of contact lens wear on tear fluid cytokine levels after adjusting for the age of the subjects.

Pairwise comparison shows that altered functional constraints have occurred at specific amino acid positions after phylogenetic diversification of the paralogues.	"amino acid	88	98	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""amino acid"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
None of the functionally divergent amino acids were found to reside within obvious sequences patterns or motifs.	"amino acids	35	46	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""amino acids"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
On the functional level, whole cell patch clamp experiments suggest that the bestrophins act as Ca2 +- dependent transporters of chloride ions across epithelial borders [ 11 - 16 ].	"bestrophins	77	88	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bestrophins"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Functional proteins likely exist as multimeric complexes eventually by forming homo - or heteromeric associations between bestrophin family members.	"bestrophin	122	132	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bestrophin"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Uncertainty exists as to the specific function of bestrophin 1.	"bestrophin 1	50	62	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bestrophin 1"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
As an alternative to its activity as a chloride channel, bestrophin 1 may act as an accessory protein in the regulation of voltage - gated calcium channels [ 17 ].	"bestrophin 1	57	69	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bestrophin 1"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Consequently, distinct functional aspects of bestrophin 1 may contribute to RPE dysfunction and thus may explain the variable phenotypes associated with a mutant protein.

We first retrieved the available bestrophin sequences from the currently sequenced genomes.	"bestrophin	33	43	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bestrophin"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
While C. elegans reveals a large number of bestrophins ( n = 26 ), most other organisms harbour three or four family members.	"bestrophins	43	54	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bestrophins"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
After exclusion of unfinished and partial protein sequences, a phylogenetic tree with 53 selected bestrophins ( Table 1) was constructed by the neighbour - joining ( NJ) method based on a gamma corrected Jones - Taylor - Thornton ( JTT) distance matrix [ 19, 20] ( Figure 1 ).	"bestrophins	98	109	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bestrophins"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Overall, the data indicate that the bestrophin subfamilies have evolved by gene duplication events, in good agreement with previous findings demonstrating that large - scale gene duplications have occurred during chordate evolution [ 21, 22 ].

Hydropathy plotting of 53 bestrophins ( orthologues and paralogues, Table 1) revealed six hydrophobic regions including four putative transmembrane domains with hydropathy values reaching or above the threshold of 1. 6 ( Figure 2 ).

Amino acids in a protein sequence are expected to be under different selective pressure and to have different underlying dN / dS ratios.	"Amino acids	0	11	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Amino acids"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In order to test for positive selection at individual amino acid codons, the site - specific models implemented in codeml were used.	"amino acid	54	64	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""amino acid"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
a The dN / dS ratio is an average over all sites of bestrophin gene alignments.	"bestrophin	52	62	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bestrophin"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
e Probability cut - off is the minimal posterior probaility for amino acids causing functional divergence.	"amino acids	64	75	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""amino acids"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Next, single amino acid residues responsible for the functional divergence were predicted based on site - specific profiles ( Figure 3A) in combination with suitable cut - off - values derived from the posterior probability of each comparison ( Table 3 ).	"amino acid	13	23	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""amino acid"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The predicted functional sites are not equally distributed throughout the respective bestrophin, but instead are clustered in the hydrophilic loops between predicted transmembrane domains 1 and 2 as well as 5 and 6 and immediately C - terminal to transmembrane domain 6 ( Figure 3B, see Additional file 2, and Table 4 ).	"bestrophin	85	95	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bestrophin"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
We thus speculate that these two sites may be of functional importance for the respective bestrophin subfamilies.	"bestrophin	90	100	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bestrophin"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In addition, 11 out of 44 positively selected sites detected by LRT in codeml were also found to be functionally divergent between bestrophin paralogues ( marked by asterisk in Table 4 ).

As shown previously [ 34 ], bestrophin 4 can be activated by free Ca2 + on the cytoplasmic side although the kinetics of the activation / deactivation is much slower than for typical Ca2 +- activated chloride currents [ 35 ].

In absence of erythrocytes, the reduction of HIV infectivity in plasma was significantly greater when complement was present than when it was inactivated ( p < 0. 05, Wilcoxon signed - rank test, mean 678 vs 244 ), as reported by Huber et al ., 2006 [ 15] ( Figure 4A ).	"HIV	45	48	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The presence of erythrocytes, concomitantly incubated with complement, led to a loss of HIV infectivity considered extremely significant compared to erythrocytes incubated with inactivated complement ( mean 3, 675 vs. 210, p < 0. 0005, Wilcoxon signed - rank test) Figure 4B.	"HIV	88	91	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
More importantly, the loss of HIV infectivity in presence of complement was exacerbated when erythrocytes were also present ( 639 vs. 3, 457, p < 0. 0005 Wilcoxon signed - rank test) ( Figure 4C ).	"HIV	30	33	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
On the other hand, when complement was inactivated, the loss of HIV infectivity was not affected by the presence or the absence of erythrocytes ( mean 210 vs. 244, p > 0. 5 Wilcoxon signed - rank test) and it was always lower than when the non - inactivated complement was present ( Figure 4D ).

Indeed the erythrocyte - associated p24 antigen is not associated to detectable pVL [ 1 ].	"p24	36	39	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""p24"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
This fact could indicate a different viral clearance or a viral capture independent of the presence of antibodies in erythrocytes [ 9 ], [ 10 ].	"antibodies	103	113	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""antibodies"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Moreover, we ruled out the possibility that p24 - antigen on patients ’ erythrocytes interfere with the capture capacity assay.	"p24	44	47	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""p24"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

Most polar bears remain on the sea ice as it recedes and then come ashore to spend the ice ‐ free period on Baffin and Bylot Islands ( Taylor et al ., 2005 ).	"polar bears	5	16	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""polar bears"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
An unknown but probably small number of bears remain on land in Melville Bay, NW Greenland throughout the ice ‐ free period ( Born, 1995; Born, Heilmann, Holm, & Laidre, 2011; SWG, 2016 ).	"bears	40	45	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Adult female polar bears ( AF) were captured in NW Greenland on the fast and pack ice between mid ‐ March and mid ‐ April 2009 – 2013 in Baffin Bay.	"polar bears	13	24	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""polar bears"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Searches for bears occurred between 70 ° 22 ′ N and 76 ° 20 ′ N, to a maximum distance of ca.	"bears	13	18	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Bears were located and captured from a helicopter using standard chemical immobilization techniques ( Stirling, Spencer, & Andriashek, 1989 ).	"Bears	0	5	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Bears"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Positions exceeding a maximum between ‐ location travel velocity ( 10 km / hr based on previous movement studies of polar bears, Laidre et al ., 2013) and angle ( measured from the track between three successive locations; set to the default) were removed by the filtering algorithm.	"polar bears	116	127	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""polar bears"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The resulting locations for each bear were reduced to a single position per day to reduce autocorrelation bias, standardize temporal sampling, and address the effects of variable duty cycling among PTTs.	"bear	33	37	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bear"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Telemetry data were divided into seasons: spring ( March – July, which included the peak of sea ‐ ice coverage and initiation of sea ‐ ice break ‐ up ), summer ( August – October, which included the end of break ‐ up and the on ‐ land period ), and winter ( November – February, which included the freeze ‐ up period and time when bears returned to the sea ice ).	"bears	331	336	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 331, ""end_span"": 336, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Bears with < 3 locations were removed from analyses when transmitter failure occurred immediately after deployment.	"Bears	0	5	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Bears"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Polar bears collared in this study ranged over the entire Baffin Bay region ( SWG, 2016 ).	"Polar bears	0	11	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Polar bears"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
All captures occurred within the bounds of the BB subpopulation management unit ( PBSG, 2010) and bears moved back and forth freely between Canada and Greenland during both periods ( Figure 1 ).	"bears	98	103	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
However, in the 2000s, it was only possible to deploy collars on the Greenlandic side of Baffin Bay due to community reservations in Nunavut about polar bear immobilization and handling ( SWG, 2016 ).	"polar bear	147	157	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""polar bear"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Prior to conducting interdecadal analyses of polar bear movement data, we evaluated the 1990s and 2000s data to identify potential effects of differences in collar deployment location.	"polar bear	45	55	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""polar bear"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We then quantified what overall range of latitudes on land on Baffin Island was used by polar bears in both decades.	"polar bears	88	99	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""polar bears"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Overall, excluding permanent residents of Melville Bay, 92% of the AF bears collared in spring in West Greenland in the 2000s moved to Baffin Island by fall and were located inside the same fall collaring area used in the 1990s ( defined as a polygon around 1990s collaring sites ).	"bears	70	75	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
These analyses support our comparative work between decades on the subpopulation of polar bears tracked in Baffin Bay.	"polar bears	84	95	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""polar bears"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We estimated the geographic area characterized by a high probability of use by collared AF polar bears in Baffin Bay using a fixed kernel density approach ( Worton, 1989 ).	"polar bears	91	102	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""polar bears"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We calculated Gaussian bivariate normal kernel density estimates for each decade ( n = 2 ), month ( n = 12 ), and season ( n = 3) for all bears in the sample.	"bears	138	143	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We sampled bears with replacement 1, 000 times for each monthly and seasonal KDE and calculated the area of the 95% contour polygon ( bounding 95% of the KDE surface volume ).	"bears	11	16	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We examined the departures from BB using telemetry data by estimating the fraction of bears that crossed BB management boundaries up to 300 days after capture.	"bears	86	91	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Specifically, we calculated the number of days since capture until each polar bear left BB or until the end of their observation period for those that were not observed to leave.	"polar bear	72	82	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""polar bear"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We considered a departure to be at least 30 days long, thus bears that departed BB but returned in < 30 days were not included in the estimates.	"bears	60	65	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We summarized which subpopulation bears departed to, the departure month, and compared this across decades.	"bears	34	39	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Harvest recoveries and recaptures of marked bears	"bears	44	49	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We evaluated spatial patterns in live recaptures and dead recoveries of marked bears.	"bears	79	84	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We included bears that were marked in spring ( April – May) or fall ( August – October) during two periods when BB subpopulation mark – recapture studies were undertaken; 1991 – 1997 and 2009 – 2014.	"bears	12	17	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
From 1991 to 1997, 881 polar bears were captured, physically marked, and tissue samples were collected ( Taylor et al ., 2005 ).	"polar bears	23	34	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""polar bears"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
During this second marking period ( 2009 – 2013 ), all sampled bears were genotyped to determine sex and individual identification.	"bears	63	68	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This allowed us to detect the number of bears sampled in the 2000s that had been originally physically marked in the 1990s.	"bears	40	45	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Number of genetic samples used from polar bears from the Baffin Bay ( BB ), Kane Basin ( KB ), Lancaster Sound ( LS ), and Davis Strait ( DS) subpopulations for the winter ‐ spring analyses.	"polar bears	36	47	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""polar bears"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Baffin Bay and adjacent subpopulations ( KB, DS, LS) support a subsistence harvest of polar bears, which is characterized by high hunter reporting and management strategies designed to achieve maximum sustainable yield based on demographic data estimated from capture – recapture studies ( SWG, 2016 ).	"polar bears	86	97	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""polar bears"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Harvest recoveries of marked bears were detected via hunter returns of ear tags and lip tattoos as part of the continuous harvest monitoring program across all subpopulations in Canada and Greenland ( Peacock, Laake, Laidre, Born, & Atkinson, 2012 ), though over time tag loss leads to lower probability of detection of recapture of physically marked individuals.	"bears	29	34	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
With respect to short ‐ term fidelity, the frequencies of harvest recovery of individuals marked between 2011 and 2013 were examined to assess whether bears sampled during the recent BB mark – recapture study ( SWG, 2016) remained within the subpopulation during the sampling interval.	"bears	151	156	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 151, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
For this assessment, all recoveries were detected by matching genotypes of harvested bears to genotypes of marked individuals.	"bears	85	90	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We also updated previously reported information on long ‐ term fidelity and patterns of harvest recovery in BB ( Taylor & Lee, 1995; Taylor et al ., 2001; Peacock et al ., 2012) by examining the frequencies of bears originally marked in the 1990s that were recovered in the harvest between 1991 and 2014.	"bears	210	215	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 210, ""end_span"": 215, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
From 1991 to 2010, recoveries were detected solely by hunter returns of tags and lip tattoos from marked bears.	"bears	105	110	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
From 2011 to 2014, recoveries were detected either by tag and tattoos or by matching the genotype of a harvested bear to the genotype of one of the 635 marked individuals that could theoretically have been alive in 2011.	"bear	113	117	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bear"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Finally, we used mark – recapture data from 1991 to 1997 and 2011 to 2013 in BB together with over 1, 500 physical captures of polar bears in the neighboring DS subpopulation between 2005 and 2007 ( Peacock, Taylor, Laake, & Stirling, 2013) to summarize recapture frequencies.	"polar bears	127	138	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""polar bears"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In particular, we examined whether there was evidence that DS bears had moved northward, in concert with sea ‐ ice loss, across the BB ‐ DS subpopulation boundary.	"bears	62	67	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Recaptures of bears originally marked in BB 1991 – 1997 were detected during sampling in DS ( 2005 – 2007) by observations of tags and lip tattoos.	"bears	14	19	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Recaptures of bear marked in DS ( 2005 – 2007) were detected during sampling in BB ( 2011 – 2013) by matching genotypes.	"bear	14	18	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bear"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In the 1990s, 31 bears ( 72% of the total sample) were collared in fall on land on Baffin Island, 6% on the sea ice off the Baffin Island coast, and 21% on the sea ice in West Greenland.	"bears	17	22	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Polar bears in both decades ranged over the entire Baffin Bay during the ice ‐ covered season, freely moving back and forth between Baffin Island and West Greenland, though the disappearance of the sea ‐ ice platform in the southern extent of the range prevented long ‐ distance movements into Davis Strait in the 2000s ( Figure 1 ).

Movements of adult female polar bears collared in Baffin Bay in the 1990s ( left) and 2000s ( right ).	"polar bears	26	37	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""polar bears"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Colored symbols show locations where the bears were captured ( cf. Figure 1)	"bears	41	46	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
To evaluate whether the substantial summer range reduction was influenced by capture location, we compared range sizes between a subsample of the 1990s bears collared in Melville Bay, West Greenland on the spring pack ice ( n = 9 ), and the full sample from the 2000s.	"bears	152	157	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 152, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We found similar patterns; the subsample of bears in the 1990s also used significantly larger ranges in summer ( i. e ., Figure 4c ), and this resulted in a > 35% summer range reduction for the 2000s ( p <. 001 ).

The reduction in range sizes resulted in a reduced habitat area used by bears in the 2000s.	"bears	72	77	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
There was < 50% overlap in ranges for bears in the 1990s and 2000s in all months and seasons.	"bears	38	43	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
These same patterns were demonstrated by the analyses of the subsample using n = 9 bears from the 1990s.	"bears	83	88	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

Overall, a significantly lower fraction of collared polar bears left BB in the 2000s than in the 1990s ( χ2 = 6. 8, df = 1, p =. 009 ).	"polar bears	52	63	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""polar bears"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In the 2000s, five of 38 ( 13 %) bears also moved north directly from BB into KB, and an additional two moved to KB after first moving to LS.	"bears	33	38	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In the 1990s, n = 2 of 43 bears moved to KB and both initially moved into LS.	"bears	26	31	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
At 100 days after capture, approximately 73% ( 95% CI: 60 %– 88 %) of collared bears remained in BB in the 1990s, whereas in the 2000s 91% ( 95% CI: 81 %– 100 %) remained ( Z = 2. 041, p =. 041) ( Figure 6 ).

At 300 days after capture, approximately 55% ( 95% CI: 43 %– 74 %) of collared bears remained in BB in the 1990s, whereas in the 2000s, 84% ( 95% CI: 72 %– 98 %) remained ( Z = 2. 732, p =. 006; Figure 6 ).

Overall, 56% of the collared bears never left BB during the 1990s tracking period, whereas 79% never left in the 2000s tracking period ( Table 3 ).	"bears	29	34	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Formal estimation of rates of return was complicated by highly variable follow ‐ up times; however, bears generally moved back and forth more frequently between BB and DS in the 1990s.

Of the 1, 250 bears marked in BB ( 2011 – 2013 ), 85 individuals were recovered in the reported subsistence harvest in Nunavut and Greenland or detected through genotyping during 2011 – 2014.	"bears	14	19	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Of these individuals, 84 ( 99 %) were recovered in the BB harvest, and one bear was harvested in DS.	"bear	75	79	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bear"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Also during this period, 11 bears marked in the 1990s in BB were recovered in the harvest ( all in BB ).	"bears	28	33	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Of the 881 bears marked in BB from 1991 to 1997, 181 individuals were recovered in the subsistence harvest in Canada and Greenland between 1991 and 2014; 83% of these recoveries occurred within BB.	"bears	11	16	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Recoveries of marked BB bears outside the bounds of the BB subpopulation tended to be male ‐ biased ( 3. 29 males per female) relative to recoveries within BB ( 1. 85 males per female ), although this was not statistically significant ( p =. 483, Fisher ' s exact test ).	"bears	24	29	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Of the 1, 518 unique individuals captured in DS in the mid ‐ 2000s ( Peacock et al ., 2013 ), 13 ( 0. 8 %) were recaptures from the sample of 881 bears originally marked in BB between 1991 and 1997.	"bears	146	151	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Of the bears sampled in BB from 2009 to 2013 ( 1, 250 unique individuals, 1, 623 capture events ), 16 ( 1 %) were originally marked in DS between 2005 and 2007.	"bears	7	12	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 7, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Despite extensive marking of bears throughout the range of both subpopulations, the frequency of recorded interpopulation movements was relatively low and mainly clustered near the boundary.	"bears	29	34	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Based on straight line distance between capture location and the BB ‐ DS subpopulation boundary, the 29 individuals that made interpopulation movements were first captured significantly closer to the boundary than other bears marked in these subpopulations ( χ2 = 169. 48, df = 11, p <. 001 ).	"bears	220	225	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 220, ""end_span"": 225, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The average expected heterozygosity, based on eight polymorphic microsatellites, for 402 polar bears sampled during winter – spring ( November – May) in 2009 – 2014 ranged from 0. 779 ± 0. 018 ( KB) to 0. 804 ± 0. 012 ( BB and LS ).

Over the past three decades, there has been a significant decline in sea ice in Baffin Bay and surrounding areas ( Stern & Laidre, 2016 ), which has directly translated to loss of habitat available to the BB polar bear subpopulation.	"polar bear	208	218	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""polar bear"", ""start_span"": 208, ""end_span"": 218, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The movements of individual polar bears have been studied using satellite telemetry for decades ( e. g ., Amstrup, Durner, Stirling, Lunn, & Messier, 2000; Born, Wiig, & Thomassen, 1997; Laidre et al ., 2013, 2015; Wiig, Born, & Pedersen, 2003 ), and inference has almost exclusively been based on adult females because of the challenges of instrumenting adult males ( Wiig et al ., 2017 ).	"polar bears	28	39	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""polar bears"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Bears collared in West Greenland in the 2000s used nearly the entire Baffin Island coastline in fall and were distributed over the same capture region and same range of latitudes where females in the 1990s were collared, with the exception of the southern point around Cape Dyer.	"Bears	0	5	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Bears"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Further, subsample analyses of a small number of bears collared in spring in a restricted area of West Greenland in the 1990s ( n = 9) provided the same significant results on summer range reduction as the larger dataset.	"bears	49	54	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
There was no northward shift in summer because bears ’ ranges contracted on land around similar latitudes as used in the 1990s.	"bears	47	52	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The same patterns and statistical significance were found when a small fraction of Greenland resident bears ( AFs that remain year ‐ round at Melville Bay glacier fronts, SWG, 2016) were excluded from the analyses.	"bears	102	107	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Nevertheless, data on harvest recoveries of marked bears provide a supplemental line of evidence to support subpopulation delineations based on more detailed methods such as cluster analysis of movement data ( Taylor et al ., 2001 ).	"bears	51	56	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We documented very low levels of harvest recovery of bears outside their subpopulation of origin based on data collected between 2011 and 2014.	"bears	53	58	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Bears marked in the final year of study had a near zero probability of recovery because harvest monitoring was not extended far beyond the last year of marking ( in 2013 ).	"Bears	0	5	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Bears"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
However, bears marked in the first 2 years were available for recovery in the harvest, subject to rates of natural mortality.	"bears	9	14	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The total number of bears marked in 2011 and 2012 was equivalent to ~ 32% of the point estimate of abundance for the BB subpopulation ( SWG, 2016 ).	"bears	20	25	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Our findings imply that BB bears exhibit a high degree of short ‐ term fidelity to this geographically defined unit, which is consistent with estimates of site fidelity derived from mark – recapture analyses ( SWG, 2016 ).	"bears	27	32	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Of note, prior to 2006 when quotas were introduced in Greenland, there was significant uncertainty in the accuracy of the reported polar bear harvest from BB and KB ( SWG, 2016 ).	"polar bear	131	141	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""polar bear"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The extent to which marked bears were under or over reported prior to that date is unknown, however, new monitoring and mandatory reporting laws have substantially improved reporting since then.	"bears	27	32	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Although sample sizes were insufficient to investigate complex patterns and “ fidelity ” was defined relative to the onshore, summer sampling area ( as opposed to the BB management unit, in the current analysis) results from capture – recapture modeling support our finding of relatively high fidelity of polar bears in BB.	"polar bears	305	316	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""polar bears"", ""start_span"": 305, ""end_span"": 316, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The boundary between the BB and DS subpopulations is spanned by pack ice in spring that provides a continuous platform for bears to move between subpopulations ( Stern & Laidre, 2016 ).	"bears	123	128	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Nevertheless, consistent differences between BB and DS polar bears have been shown through genetics ( Paetkau et al ., 1999; Peacock et al ., 2015; this study ), movements ( Taylor et al ., 2001 ), and diet ( Thiemann, Iverson, & Stirling, 2008 ), suggesting a functional boundary between them.	"polar bears	55	66	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""polar bears"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Here, we investigated if there has been an increased exchange of polar bears across this boundary, which could contribute to exchange between subpopulations.	"polar bears	65	76	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""polar bears"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Similarly, the telemetry data of collared BB bears demonstrate a reduced frequency of visitation to DS.	"bears	45	50	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Bears that moved between BB and DS tended to be initially captured close to the BB ‐ DS boundary (< 100 km ).	"Bears	0	5	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Bears"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This may reflect the high degree of fidelity shown by BB and DS bears to their seasonal onshore range ( e. g ., Taylor et al ., 2001 ), similar for other subpopulations ( Wiig, 1995; Mauritzen, Derocher, & Wiig, 2001; Stirling, Lunn, Iacozza, Elliott, & Obbard, 2004; Zeyl, Ehrich, Aars, Bachmann, & Wiig, 2010 ).	"bears	64	69	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bears"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Future sea ‐ ice loss is expected to fragment polar bear subpopulations, increase isolation, alter gene flow, and disrupt population boundaries ( Derocher, Lunn, & Stirling, 2004; Kutschera et al ., 2016; Sahanatian & Derocher, 2012 ).	"polar bear	46	56	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""polar bear"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Genetic variation in polar bears is relatively low, and genetics is a relatively insensitive means of identifying, defining, or detecting change in subpopulation structure, especially when compared to individual ‐ based telemetry and tag recoveries.	"polar bears	21	32	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""polar bears"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Time ‐ lag effects in genetic composition are influenced by the relatively long generation length for polar bears (~ 11. 5 years; Regehr et al ., 2016 ), and several generations may be needed to demonstrate increased genetic isolation as a consequence of climate ‐ induced range contraction.	"polar bears	102	113	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""polar bears"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
For example, in areas around the Arctic Basin where sea ice converges or diverges ( Amstrup et al ., 2008 ), polar bears from multiple subpopulations may become aggregated or even mix.	"polar bears	109	120	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""polar bears"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
These findings and methods may prove useful for reassessing polar bear subpopulation boundaries in a future with reduced sea ice.	"polar bear	60	70	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""polar bear"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

Protein sequence n - mer or n - gram features: Since the sequence of a protein determines its function to a great extent, it may be possible to predict PPIs using the amino acid sequence of a protein pair.

The intuition behind this feature is that genes that are significantly differentially regulated are more likely to be involved in the infection process, and thereby in interactions with bacterial proteins.

Hence for the purpose of evaluation, we used some of the PPI datasets as “ sources ” for building a model and one as the “ target .” We evaluate the machine - learning based methods in two settings of transfer: pathogen - level transfer, where the host is fixed to be human and the pathogen is one of various bacterial species.

The N - linked glycans are sialylated at the terminal positions, with each glycan being able to carry up to five sialic acid residues17.	"sialic acid	113	124	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sialic acid"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In the absence of posttranslational modifications, the theoretical pI of the full - length prion protein is 9. 6 and the estimated charge at pH 7. 5 is + 9. 518.	"prion	91	96	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""prion"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
However, due to glycan sialylation, the actual pI of PrP molecules was found to be highly heterogeneous and spread from pH 9. 6 to acidic pH1819.	"PrP	53	56	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PrP"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In intact PrPSc, the glycans are believed to be directed outwards, with the terminal sialic acid residues located at the interface with the extracellular environment or solvent202122.

In previous study, we showed that sialylation level of PrPSc controls prion infectivity18.	"prion	70	75	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""prion"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In previous studies that examined prions formed in familial and sporadic prion diseases, the three glycoforms were found to be recruited into PrPSc in a selective fashion23.

PrPSc glycoform ratios are believed to be an intrinsic characteristic of prion strains or subtypes and, as such, have been used for strain typing2425.	"prion	73	78	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""prion"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Here we propose that diglycosylated glycoforms are selectively excluded to reduce electrostatic repulsion between sialic acid residues within PrPSc.	"sialic acid	114	125	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sialic acid"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The current study tests the above hypothesis on the role of sialylation in controlling the prion replication barrier and glycoform ratios.	"prion	91	96	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""prion"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

Because the samples were denatured prior to 2D gel electrophoresis, the distribution of charge isoforms in the horizontal dimension reflects sialylation status of individual PrP molecules, where hypersialylated molecules run toward acidic pH and hyposialylated toward basic pH18.

In summary, the changes in glycoform ratios in response to changes in sialylation status support the hypothesis that negative charges of sialic acid residues create electrostatic repulsion that limits recruitments of diglycosylated glycoforms.	"sialic acid	137	148	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sialic acid"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
These results demonstrate that reducing the content of sialic acid residues on PrPC glycans result in recruitment of the three glycoforms into PrPSc proportionally to their relative populations in a substrate.	"sialic acid	55	66	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sialic acid"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
A similar trend was found in hamster strains, although it was less pronounced ( Fig. 1B ), because diglycosylated forms were predominant in brain - derived PrPSc.	"hamster	29	36	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""hamster"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
As a result, the charge distribution of diglycosylated isoforms is shifted toward acidic pH and typically extends beyond that of monoglycosylated isoforms, which accommodate only up to five sialic residues per molecule.

In the absence of posttranslational modifications, prion protein has a strong positive charge at physiological pH with the theoretical pI of 9. 618.	"prion	51	56	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""prion"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Sialylation of glycans can add up to ten negatively charged residues and shifts the pI toward acidic pH, making the population of PrP molecules highly heterogeneous with respect to pI and the net charges at physiological pH1718.	"PrP	130	133	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PrP"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In PrPSc particles, glycans are believed to be directed outward where the terminal sialic acid residues create a dense negative charge on the PrPSc surface202122.	"sialic acid	83	94	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sialic acid"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The hamster strains ( 263K, HY, DY, SSLOW) had the weakest negative selection, while 22L and ME7 strains were in the middle.	"hamster	4	11	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""hamster"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This observation illustrates that the pressure for preferential selection of un - and monoglycosylated forms was released by cleaving sialic acid residues.	"sialic acid	134	145	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sialic acid"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The glycoform ratios within PrPSc are believed to be one of the intrinsic characteristics of prion strains or PrPSc subtypes ( reviewed in31 ).	"prion	93	98	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""prion"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In fact, the glycoform ratios have been used for strain typing and classification of CJD type2425.	"CJD	85	88	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""CJD"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
It was not clear why three glycoforms are recruited by prion strains in different proportions even within the same host.	"prion	55	60	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""prion"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The current work demonstrates that the strain - specific ratio of the three glycoforms is a result of negative selection of heavily sialylated PrP molecules.	"PrP	143	146	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PrP"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The extent to which heavily sialylated PrP is excluded is presumably controlled by the strain - specific structure of PrPSc and relative position of the two glycans ( Fig. 6 ).	"PrP	39	42	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PrP"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Remarkably, when exposed to desialylated substrate, prion strains lose strain - specific selectivity toward different glycoforms and the glycoform ratio within PrPSc mirrors that of PrPC.	"prion	52	57	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""prion"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In combination with substantial strain - specific differences in glycoform ratios, these differences are likely to produce distinct strain - specific density of sialic acid residues on a surface of PrPSc particles and distinct strain - specific pIs of PrPSc.	"sialic acid	161	172	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sialic acid"", ""start_span"": 161, ""end_span"": 172, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
For instance, at physiological pH, RML PrPSc particles are expected to have net positive charges, whereas PrPSc particles of hamster strains are expected to be charged negatively ( Fig. 2 ).	"hamster	125	132	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""hamster"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Because treatment with swainsonine blocks complex glycosylation including sialylation, it is expected that the glycoform ratios would change in favor of diglycosylated forms regardless whether selection of a new variants occurs or not.	"swainsonine	23	34	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""swainsonine"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
To account for the negative selection of diglycosylated / hypersialylated PrPC, glycans of the neighboring PrP molecules should be aligned in close proximity to each other within assembled PrPSc particles.	"PrP	74	77	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PrP"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
More substantial clashes between glycans of neighboring diglycosylated forms are expected for strains or PrPSc subtypes with predominantly monoglycosylated forms, such as sporadic CJD, in comparison with the strains where diglycosylated forms are predominant, such as new variant CJD24 ( Fig. 6 ).

For the three mouse strains tested in the current study, partial desialylation of PrPC increased the replication rates by 20 – 50 fold ( Fig. 5 ).	"mouse	14	19	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

Although cell division has slowed for N - deplete cells from the fourth day onwards, the increase in dry weight ( Fig. 1d) was largely due to the accumulation of storage compounds such as starch and glycerol, as the cells continue to accumulate organic carbon ( Fig. 1b, c ).

Although there was a decrease in chlorophyll content for both N - replete and N - deplete cultures on day 3, N - replete cultures subsequently recovered chlorophyll levels to the original state ( i. e.

There were minimal changes to the fatty acid ( FA) composition between either cultures; C18: 3 is the most abundant FA in D. tertiolecta, making up to 66% of its profile ( Fig. 3a, b ).

In D3, the upregulated genes frequently represented those involved in central carbon metabolism ( CCM) 39, which includes the pathways of TCA cycle ( 75% enriched ), glycolysis ( 28. 6% enriched ), and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway ( OPPP) ( enrichment of glucose - 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase activity) ( Fig.	"glucose - 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase	266	303	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""glucose - 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase"", ""start_span"": 266, ""end_span"": 303, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
As the cells progress to stationary phase on D5, the most obvious difference was the enrichment for multiple downregulated categories in photosynthesis: Chlorophyll biosynthetic process ( 75 %), photosynthesis ( 56. 5 %), photosystem I ( 50 %), photosynthesis, light harvesting ( 41. 7 %) ( Fig.	"Chlorophyll	153	164	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Chlorophyll"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 164, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Surprisingly, FA biosynthesis ( 46. 1 %) and acetyl - CoA carboxylase activity ( 66. 7 %) were downregulated in N - replete samples, suggesting a repression of de novo FA synthesis.

Analysis of the expression of key genes in the FA, TAG and starch synthesis pathways showed that upon N - depletion, the oleaginous microalga N. oceanica and moderate TAG accumulator C. vulgaris experienced downregulation in the FA synthesis pathway, a pattern similar to that in the low TAG - accumulating D. tertiolecta from this study ( Fig. 5, Table S5 ).	"microalga	132	141	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""microalga"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In microalgae, TAGs and starch are the two primary energy storage products and both synthesis pathways share common carbon precursors.	"microalgae	3	13	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""microalgae"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
It has been reported that oleaginous microalgae are able to accumulate large amounts of TAGs ( up to 60% of dry weight) under N - depletions414243444546.	"microalgae	37	47	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""microalgae"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Although these studies show that N - depletion enabled oleaginous cells to channel carbon to TAGs, little attention has been paid to non - oleaginous species which prefer alternative carbon stores such as starch and glycerol, and the transcriptomic basis governing these carbon fluxes.

The observed drop in chlorophyll content and decreased PSII quantum yield ( Fig. 1e, f) coincides with previous reports that demonstrated the degradation of chlorophyll and carotenoids in D. tertiolecta upon nitrogen starvation515253.

Multiple studies of nutrient limitation in microalgae point to the degradation of thylakoid membranes in favour of the de novo synthesis of TAGs where intracellular membrane remodeling substantially contribute to neutral lipid accumulation54555657.

This is similar to other researchers who observe similar declines in total fatty acid content in D. tertiolecta under N - depletion ( 7. 5% of DCW in N - sufficient vs 5. 9% of DCW in N - deficient) 29.

This notion is supported by a recent report which showed that when cultured under N - depleted conditions, D. tertiolecta had significant decreases in the lipid classes of diacylglyceryltrimethylhomoserine ( DGTS) and digalactosyldiacylglycerol ( DGDG ), a main component of chloroplast membranes52.

As Nannochloropsis cells lack starch synthesis genes consistent with the absence of pyrenoid starch135960, it may be logical the excess carbon and energy derived from the breakdown of membrane lipids are channeled to TAGs.

Thus, the increased activity of CCM pathways and genes contributing to the generation of acetyl - CoA and NADPH may merely be a general response of microalgae cells to N - depletion rather than a determinant of oleaginicity.

S7 ), when photosynthesis is compromised. D. tertiolecta also specifically degrade starch in high salinity stress conditions to yield DHAP which can be used to produce glycerol67, making starch a more suitable storage compound as the cells can respond to both nutrient deficiency and salinity stress, conditions which could fluctuate greatly in their natural environments68.

However, D. tertiolecta also shares similar upregulation of CCM genes as the oleaginous microalga N. oceanica, where CCM pathways were suggested to provide substrates for FA and TAG synthesis during N - depletion.

• Epi - off CXL is superior to epi - on CXL in terms of enzymatic resistance .• Epi - on CXL effectiveness can be improved by using a prolonged iontophoresis protocol .• Higher riboflavin concentrations and increased UVA radiance may also enhance epi - on CXL.

Similarly, preparations without dextran but with sodium chloride 0. 44% and benzalkonium chloride ( BAC) have been shown to facilitate trans - epithelial riboflavin stromal absorption ( Kissner et al ., 2010, Raiskup et al ., 2012 ).

In addition to the desire to keep the epithelium intact, the current “ gold - standard ”, epi - off - CXL protocol, involves a 30 min application of riboflavin followed by a 30 min irradiation with 370 nm UVA light, with an intensity of 3 mW / cm2, necessitating in excess of one hour treatment time.

Riboflavin acts as a photo - sensitizer for the production of oxygen free radicals, which drive the CXL process ( McCall et al ., 2010) and as a result insufficient stromal absorption may result in treatment failure ( Wollensak et al ., 2003, Wollensak and Iomdina, 2009 ).

Although minor differences in the rate of enzymatic digestion were seen between similarly treated corneas in runs 1 and 2, possibly due to variations in the age and breed of the pig eyes in different batches of abattoir tissue, each run showed an increased resistance in all of the cross - linked groups compared to their non - irradiated controls.

Whilst dis - CXL showed a greater resistance to digestion than the non - irradiated controls, it was not as effective as the other epi - on - CXL protocols tested, possibly due to the non - homogeneous uptake of riboflavin that we have documented previously ( Alhamad et al ., 2012 ).

Furthermore, initial clinical studies in prospective case series have reported cessation of keratoconus progression with up to 15 month follow - up and some limited improvements in keratometric and visual parameters ( Bikbova and Bikbov, 2014, Buzzonetti et al ., 2015, Vinciguerra et al ., 2014b ).

Its slightly lower efficacy compared to epi - off - CXL, demonstrated by measurements of corneal disk diameter and tissue dry weight, may be due to a reduced riboflavin stromal absorption or due to other factors.

These might include absorption of UVA by riboflavin within the epithelium, resulting in shielding of the underlying stroma and a reduced UVA dosage to the stroma, although this is unlikely as a 3 min PBS wash of the ocular surface was performed before UVA exposure.

The nascent neo - sex chromosomes of black muntjacs show that regulatory mutations could accelerate the degeneration of the Y chromosome and contribute to the further evolution of dosage compensation.

We studied the intriguing case of black muntjac, in which a recent X - autosome fusion and a subsequent large autosomal inversion within just the past 0. 5 million years have led to inheritance patterns identical to the traditional X - Y ( neo - sex chromosomes ).

Putative deleterious mutations were observed in coding regions of eight investigated genes as well as cis - regulatory regions of two housekeeping genes.

Theoretical models predict that proto - Y chromosomes would further suffer a rapid accumulation of deleterious mutations and be subjected to drastic gene loss [ 6 ], consistent with only 45 genes surviving on the human Y chromosome as compared with 1, 000 functional genes on the X [ 1, 3, 7 ].

Such cases include the recently originated sex determination system, like that of Silene [ 8 ], or ' neo - sex chromosomes ', formed through a recent fusion or translocation between an autosome and a sex chromosome followed by extensive recombination suppression, and thus showing inheritance patterns like that of the better known ancient sex chromosomes [ 9, 10 ].

Surprisingly, subsequent inversions involving large part of the primitive 1p + 4 were proposed to take place in male black muntjacs ( regions from ' 22a ' to ' 17a '; Additional data file 1) [ 21, 22 ].

Because no inversion loop has been detected during meiosis of male black muntjacs [ 24 ], the whole 1p + 4 should remain heterosynaptic except for the two distal ends, which are not involved in the inversion.

The black muntjac X + 4: 1p + 4 neo - sex chromosome pair comprises approximately one - fifth of the entire genome and thus bears thousands of neo - sex gene pairs [ 21, 24 ].

These four mutations change the polarity or charge of the amino acid, which might severely affect the protein function of the neo - Y copies.	"amino acid	58	68	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""amino acid"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

By taking into account the above - described four possible deleterious nonsynonymous mutations and the deletion in the 3 '- UTR of SNX22, we conservatively estimate the rate of accumulation of deleterious mutations in exon regions of neo - Y genes to be approximately 0. 4 mutations / kb per million years ( 5 mutations / 25 kb per 0. 5 million years ).

Such a low probability of nonsense mutation plus the effect of possible purifying selection give credence to our observation that there were no coding frame - disrupting mutations among the investigated muntjac neo - Y alleles.	"muntjac	203	210	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""muntjac"", ""start_span"": 203, ""end_span"": 210, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Because of the usual small Ne values of mammals, mutant - free neo - Y alleles should be vulnerable to an irreversible loss by random drift by the ' ratchet ' process, which further leads to accumulation of deleterious mutations.

It is also less likely that there were recent selective sweeps on the neo - Y of the black muntjac, based on the DNA polymorphism data.	"black muntjac	85	98	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""black muntjac"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Recent strong positive selection would homogenize the neo - Y chromosomes among individuals [ 6 ], but we observed many polymorphic sites existing in both noncoding and coding regions of the muntjac neo - Y chromosome ( Tables 1 and 3 ).

Although ARS is rare, it is a complex and medically challenging disorder that has the potential for large - scale incidence on the battlefield or in conjunction with a domestic terrorist attack.

Detonating an improvised radiological device or nuclear warhead could necessitate the medical management of hundreds to thousands of patients with ARS, which typically occurs to some degree following a whole body dose of 1 Gray ( Gy) or more [ 1, 2 ].

The underlying pathology of ARS involves physical and chemical damage to DNA, which affects the rapidly dividing cells of the hematopoietic system and the gastrointestinal ( GI) tract.

As discussed below, the therapeutic benefit of MSC therapy for these individuals could include the facilitation of hematopoietic recovery, enhancement of healing of the GI tract and the skin, and the possible mitigation or treatment of a variety of additional ARS complications.

A commercial product consisting of purified MSCs has received regulatory approval in both Canada and New Zealand for the treatment of graft vs. host disease ( GvHD ), a potentially lethal complication of allogeneic bone marrow transplant arising from the severe immune reaction of the donated immune cells against the host tissues ( Osiris Therapeutics, Inc ., Columbia, MD ).

Once engrafted within damaged tissues, MSCs participate in the healing process both directly, through differentiation to replace lost cell types, and indirectly, through the local secretion of cytokines and other bioactive molecules that facilitate a reduction in inflammation, the inhibition of scar formation, and the enhancement of endogenous mechanisms of tissue reconstruction [ 7 ].

Relevant to hematopoietic recovery after radiation exposure, in vitro studies have also shown a positive influence of the presence of MSCs on the expansion of irradiated blood cell precursors: irradiated CD34 + cells demonstrate a several - fold growth increase when cultured in the presence vs. the absence of MSCs [ 19 ].

In fact, earlier research on creativity in ASD has focused primarily on non - verbal rather than on verbal abilities.	"ASD	43	46	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ASD"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Findings have mostly documented deficient performance in ASD, especially when using tasks that are imagination - oriented ( e. g ., Frith, 1972; Lewis and Boucher, 1991; Craig and Baron - Cohen, 1999 ).

In a recent study we found that children with ASD ( aged 12 – 15) differ from typically developing ( TD) children in comprehension of conventional metaphors but not in comprehension of novel metaphors ( Mashal and Kasirer, 2011 ).	"ASD	46	49	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ASD"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In this study we used a multiple - choice task that included conventional metaphors ( e. g ., sharp tongue ), novel metaphors ( e. g ., joy bits ), and unrelated word - pairs ( e. g ., laundry rabbit ).

It might be the case that the ability to create novel semantic connections between apparently unrelated concepts is not impaired in ASD.	"ASD	132	135	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ASD"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Consistent with our results, Hermann et al.

Responses to metaphors were significantly slower than were responses to the other types of expressions, but this pattern of results characterized both groups, with no impairment in performance seen in the ASD group.

Thus, there is evidence that people with ASD demonstrate no difficulties with figurative language, contrary to previous arguments in the literature.	"ASD	41	44	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ASD"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Note that some earlier work has suggested that individuals with ASD do not comprehend figurative language due to difficulties in executive functions ( Russell, 1997 ).	"ASD	64	67	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ASD"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
According to this account, ASD impairs planning, set - shifting ( flexibility ), working memory, and inhibition ( Ozonoff and Strayer, 1997 ).	"ASD	27	30	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ASD"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
For example, Robinson et al.

Executive dysfunction has a considerable adverse impact on the ability to plan well formed novel linguistic constructs, and to shift from one meaning of a word or phrase to another, especially in the case of metaphoric language ( Landa and Goldberg, 2005 ).

Within the ASD literature, creativity has been measured primarily by non - verbal tasks that involved the production of spontaneous sequences of colors, tones, or drawings ( Frith, 1972; Lewis and Boucher, 1991; Liu et al ., 2011) or by verbal fluency tasks ( Boucher, 1988 ).

No extensive investigation of generation of novel verbal concepts has been conducted.

A t - test for independent samples revealed a significantly greater percent of original responses ( receiving a score of 3) within the ASD group ( M = 37. 06 %, SD = 31. 38) than within the TD group ( M = 19. 41 %, SD = 11. 97 ), t ( 32) = - 2. 166, p < 0. 05 ( see Figure 3 ).	"ASD	135	138	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ASD"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
These analyses revealed significant group differences on all measures, with worse performance in the ASD group ( see Table 4 ).	"ASD	101	104	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ASD"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
ASD	"ASD	0	3	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ASD"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In each regression we first entered the group variable ( ASD, TD ), and then we entered scores on the three screening tests and the five measures of executive functioning in a stepwise manner.	"ASD	57	60	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ASD"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Group differences predicted metaphor generation with a positive beta coefficient, indicating that participants with ASD had higher scores on this test than did TD participants.	"ASD	116	119	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ASD"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The present study examined metaphor processing in adults with ASD, differentiating between conventional and novel metaphors on tests of comprehension and generation.	"ASD	62	65	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ASD"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Our results show that adults with ASD demonstrate no difficulties in comprehension of conventional and novel metaphors.	"ASD	34	37	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ASD"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Furthermore, adults with ASD outperformed age - matched TD peers in metaphor generation.	"ASD	25	28	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ASD"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
An inspection of the type of metaphors generated indicated that the ASD group produced more original and creative metaphors than did the TD group.	"ASD	68	71	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ASD"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
It is possible that the accumulated verbal knowledge that comes with age leads to greater familiarity with conventional metaphors within the ASD group.	"ASD	141	144	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ASD"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
As expected, and in line with previous studies ( Mashal and Kasirer, 2011; Melogno et al ., 2012; Hermann et al ., 2013 ), no difference was found between participants with ASD and TD age - matched peers in comprehension of novel metaphors.	"ASD	173	176	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ASD"", ""start_span"": 173, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The ability to understand novel semantic connections between seemingly unrelated concepts appears to be intact in ASD, probably because it does not rely on activation of lexicalized expressions.	"ASD	114	117	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ASD"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Consistent with this finding, Melogno et al. ( 2012) emphasized that individuals with ASD can explain novel metaphoric phrases in unique ways that rely on phonological or semantic association.	"ASD	86	89	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ASD"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Thus, comprehension of novel metaphor is intact in ASD because it relies on good associative abilities rather than on lexicalized verbal knowledge.	"ASD	51	54	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ASD"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Another finding of the current study is that contrary to our hypothesis, participants with ASD generated more metaphors than did age - matched peers.	"ASD	91	94	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ASD"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
We were specifically interested in testing whether adults with ASD relied on previous knowledge, and were thus using familiar metaphors or idioms, or alternatively, whether they generated their own novel and original metaphors.	"ASD	63	66	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ASD"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
We found that adults with ASD demonstrated greater verbal creativity than did TD individuals.	"ASD	26	29	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ASD"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
It has been reported that one in ten people with autism shows some savant skills in such categories as music, art, calendar calculations, or mathematics ( Treffert, 2009 ).	"autism	49	55	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""autism"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Yet, most studies have indicated impoverished creativity in autism.	"autism	60	66	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""autism"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
For example, in standardized tests such as the Torrance Creativity Test ( Torrance, 1974 ), people with ASD demonstrate difficulties in cognitive flexibility and imaginative fluency, as well as lack of imagination and originality compared to TD participants ( Craig and Baron - Cohen, 1999 ).	"ASD	104	107	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ASD"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
With respect to verbal creativity, this attention to details is associated with weak central coherence, leading to greater appreciation of local features over global ones. Lyons and Fitzgerald ( 2005) emphasized that in contrast to their social impairments individuals with Asperger syndrome are gifted with creativity and originality, excellent memory, strong focus of attention and specific cognitive styles.	"Asperger syndrome	274	291	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Asperger syndrome"", ""start_span"": 274, ""end_span"": 291, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The unique verbal associations generated by the ASD group in the current study could thus reflect memory for details and weak central coherence.	"ASD	48	51	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ASD"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Another reason why adults with ASD generated more original metaphors might relate to difficulty in theory of mind.	"ASD	31	34	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ASD"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Asperger proposed that characteristics such as concrete intelligence and disregard of social conventions might be prerequisites for certain forms of new thinking and creativity ( Gillberg, 2002 ). Fitzgerald ( 2004) also noted that individuals with Asperger syndrome have remarkable capacities for persistence and observation, high levels of energy and motivation, and abilities to focus intensely on a single topic.	"Asperger syndrome	249	266	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Asperger syndrome"", ""start_span"": 249, ""end_span"": 266, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Studies have shown that people with ASD may present difficulties in tasks that require response inhibition ( e. g ., Hughes and Russell, 1993; Hughes, 1996; Russell, 1997; Minshew et al ., 1999; Hill, 2004; Robinson et al ., 2009) or when they are required to shift from one response set to another ( Ozonoff and Strayer, 1997; Ozonoff et al ., 1998 ).	"ASD	36	39	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ASD"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
It is possible that low response inhibition led to generation of unique verbal expressions by our ASD participants.	"ASD	98	101	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ASD"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Future studies will have to examine whether inhibition is associated with metaphor generation in ASD.	"ASD	97	100	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ASD"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In sum, our findings indicate that adults with ASD are not impaired on comprehension of conventional and novel metaphors.	"ASD	47	50	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ASD"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
We also found that adults with ASD generate more original metaphors relative to age - matched peers and that non - verbal skills contribute to this ability.	"ASD	31	34	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ASD"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The study points to unique verbal creativity in ASD which has not been studied in this way before.	"ASD	48	51	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""ASD"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
We will argue that donor and government treatment of civil society as service delivery organizations, rather than as organizations that participate in democratic norms, have shaped how civil society organizations work to mitigate and prevent HIV.	"HIV	242	245	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 242, ""end_span"": 245, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
For quantitative data collection, sampling frames were assembled from lists of HIV - oriented or involved CSOs.	"HIV	79	82	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In light of these findings, we present key points for considering the influence of donors and government on civil society advocacy for HIV services and rights.	"HIV	135	138	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Despite the increase in international funding for CSOs to provide HIV services, little research has been done on how donors and governments are influencing CSO advocacy efforts and how CSO advocacy is influenced by donor and government influence.	"HIV	66	69	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We will argue that donors and governments treat civil society as service delivery organizations, rather than as organizations that participate in democratic norms, shaping civil society responses to HIV in ways that address donor and government, rather that citizen, needs.

The scale up of PEPFAR and the Global Fund in the mid - 2000s provided CSOs with significant funding to deliver HIV services.	"HIV	112	115	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
As these sources of funding have stabilized over the last 5 years, donors increasingly expect governments to fund a larger percentage of the HIV response.	"HIV	141	144	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Increased domestic resources for HIV will not be generated, however, without strong civil society advocacy to support appropriate policies and increased funding.	"HIV	33	36	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Donor and government influence on CSO HIV advocacy, however, is an understudied area of research.	"HIV	38	41	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The nature of this argument does restrict our analysis to organizations that work on HIV - mitigation and prevention.	"HIV	85	88	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In - depth interviews are used to understand the role of networks, organizations with a specific advocacy focus, and donor and government influence on the civil society response to HIV in Nigeria.

Seckinelgin found that donors often emphasize quantifiable services, such as condom distribution, HIV counseling and testing, and communication campaigns [ 17 ].	"HIV	98	101	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
As civil society groups respond to available funding for HIV - related services, they shift away from advocacy roles [ 18 ].	"HIV	57	60	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Regardless of whether civil society can actually perform dual roles effectively, Jenkins argues that donor emphasis on service delivery excludes organizations that fight for political power, including influencing HIV - related policy frameworks, from receiving funding [ 23 ].

Recognizing the challenges inherent to playing both service delivery and advocacy roles, CSOs and people living with HIV can form networks to promote their interests.	"HIV	117	120	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
International donors ask networks to focus on donor priorities, such as coordinating member activities, reporting activities to national AIDS councils, and directing services and training, and not on membership identified actions [ 28, 29 ].

Interview questions focused on CSO service provision, coordination, and HIV - related advocacy, and included perception and process questions.	"HIV	72	75	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The survey requested detailed information on CSO financial, human and infrastructure resources, as well as projects and advocacy activities.	"human	60	65	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The authors used Principal Components Analysis ( PCA) to create three index variables based on the relationship between six variables ( the number of full - time employees, total number of offices, total reported budget, total HIV - related activity budget, total number of part time employees, and total number of volunteers ), all related to organizational funding and scale.	"HIV	227	230	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 227, ""end_span"": 230, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The three indices captured organization size, organization budget, and organizational access to human resources.	"human	96	101	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The “ Size Index ” was based on the number of full - time employees, the total number of offices, the total reported budget, and the total HIV - related activity budget and was used in the subsequent analyses.

Finally, we structured the survey to understand the frequency, type, targets, and nature of HIV - focused advocacy.	"HIV	92	95	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
While it is conceivable that both village leaders and citizens could be targets for mass action to effect policy change, discussions with in - depth interviewees again showed that the CSOs ’ actual activities focused on HIV prevention, rather than policy change.	"HIV	220	223	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 220, ""end_span"": 223, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Respondents also cited Information, Education, and Communication campaigns, which target village leaders and citizens, as the most common HIV prevention activity.	"HIV	138	141	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Organizations with explicit advocacy agendas included the Planned Parenthood Federation of Nigeria ( PPFN ), The Initiative for Equal Rights, Journalists against AIDS, and the Health Reform Foundation of Nigeria ( HERFON ).

Advocates did have some success with the latter bill, as HIV criminalization was removed from the anti - discrimination and stigma bill, and it was signed into law in February 2015 [ 31 ].

At the state level, SACAs are supposed to coordinate the HIV response through policy development and coordination.	"HIV	57	60	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
As the President ’ s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief ( PEPFAR) and Global Fund financing flows entirely outside of SACA structures, CSOs have sources of financing independent from SACAs.	"AIDS	40	44	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AIDS"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
For example, in one state, CSOs have never provided feedback on HIV policies, nor has the SACA asked for their input.	"HIV	64	67	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Some SACA interviewees thought that the federal government preferred that CSOs deliver HIV services instead of state governments, as the federal government retains greater power and influence with weakened states.

In addition to probing civil society and government viewpoints, we also interviewed representatives of organizations that provide most of the funding for civil society ’ s response to HIV in Nigeria: international organizations and donors.

In in - depth interviews, donors emphasized the role of CSOs in extending the reach of HIV - related services, including prevention, testing, care, and treatment, but none mentioned empowering civil society to advocate for the needs of their membership.

They also thought, however, that this work had been unsuccessful, and CSOs would be dependent on international funding to conduct HIV mitigation and prevention activities for the foreseeable future.

In this section, we will turn toward analyzing the influences on the civil society response to HIV in Nigeria, identifying areas of potential conflict and co - option.	"HIV	95	98	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Building on the findings from our cross - sectional survey and in - depth interviews, we propose some key analytical points for understanding the influence of donors and government on HIV - related advocacy.	"HIV	184	187	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 184, ""end_span"": 187, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
They focus on these roles to meet service delivery mandates from their governments, such as the number of people tested for HIV or reached with prevention messages.	"HIV	124	127	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Nigeria is no different - the vast majority of international funding for HIV toward project implementation and coordination, rather than policy analysis and advocacy [ 34 ].	"HIV	73	76	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Williamson also estimated that 85 to 90% of HIV - related funding for CSOs originates from these international donors, providing an incentive for civil society to reorient their work toward their preferences [ 34 ].	"HIV	44	47	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In Nigeria, the federal government is an intermediary between donors and CSO - implemented HIV programs, and donors can influence the federal government ’ s actions toward CSOs.	"HIV	91	94	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
By agreeing to these requirements, the Nigerian government implicitly agrees that CSOs working to mitigate HIV are apolitical actors.	"HIV	107	110	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Instead of empowering CSOs to advocate for increased state responses to the HIV epidemic, they can co - opt CSOs into service delivery roles that extend the reach of government to communities without services.

Donor and government actions toward CSOs, which have mostly accommodated an apolitical and service delivery focus, will also have to change to ensure that governments lead HIV mitigation and prevention efforts.

However, when cells were cultured with OCM no laminin was detectable in the medium or bound to the culture plate ( IFAT) on days 1 – 9 post - culture.	"laminin	46	53	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""laminin"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Upon removal of Matrigel or Matrigel and Drosophila S2 cells from the cultures, no significant difference was detected in the percentage of transformed parasites between culture conditions ( with and without cells or Matrigel) ( ANOVA, F ( 2, 2) = 0. 90, P = 0. 422) ( Fig. 4 ).	"Drosophila	41	51	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Thus, BL components such as laminin do not initiate transformation.	"laminin	28	35	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""laminin"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In contrast, a 0. 2% lipid / cholesterol component was toxic to ookinetes, killing approximately 25% within 4 h of culture and all ookinetes within 24 h, and although a tenth of the concentration was not toxic, it did not stimulate transformation.

However, at pH 9. 0, GFP fluorescence was less intense and oocyst plasma membrane breakdown occurred from day 2 post - culture, after oocysts had attained diameters of 10 – 15 μm.	"GFP	21	24	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GFP"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Ookinete to oocyst transformation represents one of the most severe bottlenecks for the malaria parasite, often reducing ookinete numbers to single digits ( Dimopoulos et al ., 2002 ).

For these reasons, many culture protocols have employed a BL substitute ( Matrigel) and it has been proposed that interactions between ookinete surface or microneme proteins and the mosquito BL play some role in oocyst development ( for review see Siden - Kiamos and Louis, 2004 ).

In addition, sequences related to the genus Methanobacterium were found at low levels in the low - medium temperature digesters ( 37 – 44 ° C) and in the manure (< 2. 5 %), but were more abundant at the higher digestion temperature ( 12. 3 – 14. 4% in R52SS ).

The relative level of the phylum Bacteroidetes in the digester operating with manure was similar to that in the raw manure ( 21. 0 – 39. 4 %), but lower than that in the digesters co - digesting straw at 37 ° C ( 40. 0 – 65. 1 %).

At 44 ° C and 52 ° C, Bacteroidetes represented 13. 2 – 16. 6% and 0. 40% of the population respectively ( Fig. S3 ).	"Bacteroidetes	22	35	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Bacteroidetes"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The candidate phylum Cloacimonetes was present at levels corresponding to less than 0. 2% in the manure samples, but at higher levels in digesters operating with only manure ( 6. 0 – 14. 5 %) ( Fig. S3 ).

It is clear that isolation and cultivation of uncultured microorganisms would provide deeper insights into their function in the AD process, as suggested previously ( Narihiro and Sekiguchi, 2007; Curtis et al ., 2013 ).	"microorganisms	57	71	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""microorganisms"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
It is well known that the rumen has high cellulose - degrading efficiency and the bacteria involved in this may also be involved in degradation in the AD process.	"bacteria	82	90	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bacteria"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Methanogens active in the rumen may also contribute to methanogenesis in the biogas production process.	"Methanogens	0	11	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Methanogens"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
However, when the manure was used as substrate for biogas production, the number of sequences affiliated to this hydrogenotrophic genus represented less than 3. 2% and instead the Methanosarcina became dominant (> 97 %).	"Methanosarcina	180	194	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Methanosarcina"", ""start_span"": 180, ""end_span"": 194, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The cause of the decrease in relative abundance of Methanobrevibacter is not clear.	"Methanobrevibacter	51	69	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Methanobrevibacter"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The dominance of Methanosarcina is, however, in line with previous studies of manure - based digesters ( Karakashev et al ., 2005; Demirel and Scherer, 2008; Goberna et al ., 2010; St - Pierre and Wright, 2014 ).	"Methanosarcina	17	31	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Methanosarcina"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This confirms previous findings on bacterial populations in the rumen of cows ( Kim et al ., 2011; Danielsson et al ., 2012 ), manure digesters ( Kampmann et al ., 2012; St - Pierre and Wright, 2014) and other biogas digesters ( Krause et al ., 2008; Schlüter et al ., 2008; Lee et al ., 2012; Sundberg et al ., 2013; Ziganshin et al ., 2013; Li et al ., 2014 ).	"cows	73	77	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""cows"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This was most likely caused by the substantially higher amount ( 6. 0 – 14. 5 %) of sequences related to the candidate phylum Cloacimonetes in the manure digesters than in the manure itself.	"Cloacimonetes	126	139	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Cloacimonetes"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In the present study, sequences belonging to the uncultured WWE1 contributed to the majority of the candidate phylum Cloacimonetes ( Fig. 3 ).	"Cloacimonetes	117	130	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Cloacimonetes"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In a recent study, evidence emerged suggesting that this group of bacteria also is involved in the AD of cellulose, through an extracellular cellulose hydrolysis process and / or in the fermentation of organic substrates originating from cellulose ( Limam et al ., 2014 ).	"bacteria	66	74	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bacteria"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Variation in the bacterial community between the manure and the digester was also seen at different taxonomic levels, with the most pronounced difference within the phylum Firmicutes.	"Firmicutes	172	182	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Firmicutes"", ""start_span"": 172, ""end_span"": 182, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
For archaea, no difference was observed for the major population during operation at 37 ° C with manure as the sole substrate or with a mixture of manure and straw.	"archaea	4	11	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""archaea"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
At the phylum level, the addition of straw resulted in an increase in the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes compared with the digesters processing manure alone.	"Bacteroidetes	96	109	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Bacteroidetes"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
However, sequences affiliated with Firmicutes were at similar abundance in all digesters operated at 37 ° C.	"Firmicutes	35	45	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Firmicutes"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
However, in the present study, a higher abundance of Sedimentibacter was observed in the digesters operating with straw, in similarity to a study by Li and colleagues ( 2014 ).	"Sedimentibacter	53	68	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Sedimentibacter"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
However, this is not necessarily an expected change, as the two species isolated and characterized from this genus so far are not capable of utilizing carbohydrates ( Breitenstein et al ., 2002 ).

In line with our results, a recent metagenomic study also found an increase in the level of Bacteroidetes in anaerobic batch fermentation of straw and hay ( Hanreich et al ., 2013 ).	"Bacteroidetes	92	105	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Bacteroidetes"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Representatives of the phylum Bacteroidetes have been shown to have the capacity to degrade a wide variety of plant polysaccharides, including cellulose ( Robert et al ., 2007; Hatamoto et al ., 2014; Naas et al ., 2014 ).	"Bacteroidetes	30	43	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Bacteroidetes"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
However, recent studies show that cellulose conversion in Bacteroidetes needs further investigation ( Naas et al ., 2014 ), and thus the role of this phylum during straw degradation remains somewhat unclear.	"Bacteroidetes	58	71	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Bacteroidetes"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Interestingly, the species richness of the archaea was lowest at 44 ° C, suggesting that an increase in temperature with only a few degrees from 37 ° C has an impact on the diversity of this community.	"archaea	43	50	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""archaea"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
( unpublished ), the increase in temperature to 42 ° C even resulted in increased methane yields compared with operation at 37 ° C, in spite of a decreased species richness of methanogens.	"methanogens	176	187	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""methanogens"", ""start_span"": 176, ""end_span"": 187, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
For the bacterial community, the relative abundance of Firmicutes increased during the transition to the thermophilic temperature.	"Firmicutes	55	65	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Firmicutes"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This increase was mainly caused by a higher abundance of sequences related to the uncultured order MBA08 within the class Clostridia.	"Clostridia	122	132	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Clostridia"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Thus, it seems reasonable to assume that this cluster contains thermophilic Clostridia.	"Clostridia	76	86	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Clostridia"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In our previous study using the same anaerobic digesters and using a functional gene approach for community analysis, we also found that the major response to the temperature rise was an increase in the relative abundance of organisms belonging to the class Clostridia ( Sun et al ., 2013 ).	"Clostridia	258	268	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Clostridia"", ""start_span"": 258, ""end_span"": 268, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This trend was also seen in our previous study ( Sun et al ., 2013) and in the study by Ziganshin and colleagues ( 2013 ), who observed a decrease in sequences related to this phylum during a temperature shift from 38 ° C to 55 ° C in digesters processing cattle manure and agricultural waste.	"cattle	256	262	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""cattle"", ""start_span"": 256, ""end_span"": 262, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Temperature clearly has a strong effect on the bacterial community in a biogas digester, and the high relative abundance of Clostridia suggested a competitive advantage for this class.

A considerable fraction of bacterial reads could not be allocated to genus level, meaning that more efforts to isolate and characterize unknown dominant microbes in anaerobic digesters are needed.

Using DAT, herd level seroprevalence of T. gondii infection was not significantly associated with PAs ( P = 0. 372 ), production system ( P = 0. 170 ), herd size ( P = 0. 576 ), history of abortion ( P = 0. 549) and presence of domestic cats ( P = 0. 549 ).

Epidemiological risk factors for acquiring T. gondii between DAT seroreactive and nonreactive camels were compared using univariable logistic regression analysis.	"camels	94	100	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""camels"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Five variables ( study area [ PAs ], age, abortion, exposure to domestic and wild cats) that presented P - value < 0. 25 in the univariable analysis, were subjected to the multivariable regression model.

The analysis showed a significant association between T. gondii seropositivity and study area ( PAs) ( P = 0. 0001 ), age ( P = 0. 033) and the presence of domestic cats ( P = 0. 006; Table 3 ).

Furthermore, none of the camel owners bury or burn aborted materials; rather they simply dispose of by throwing it in the field.	"camel	25	30	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""camel"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
However, Kappa analysis demonstrated that the two tests had a moderate agreement in detecting T. gondii infection in camels ( 70. 51% agreement, Kappa = 0. 41; P < 0. 0001 ).	"camels	117	123	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""camels"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The mean weight change between seropositive ( infected, mean = 0. 25 g ± 6. 58) and seronegative ( non - infected, mean = 5. 55 g ± 3. 41) mice was significantly different ( P < 0. 0001 ).

We report for the first time evidence for T. gondii infection and its seroprevalence, risk factors and bioassay results in Ethiopian camels.	"camels	133	139	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""camels"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Seventy - four percent of seropositive camels ( from field samples) had DAT end titer of ≥ 6000.	"camels	39	45	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""camels"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
On the other hand, only study PA ( P = 0. 006) and exposure to domestic cats ( P = 0. 011) were found to be independent predictors of T. gondii seropositivity using results of ELISA ( see Additional file 1 ).	"cats	72	76	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""cats"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This suggests that DAT is a more preferred test for assessing the risk factors in camels than ELISA.	"camels	82	88	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""camels"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The observed difference in seroprevalence across PAs could be due to differences in the age of camels sampled [ 50 ], the sample size [ 44 ], the degree of environmental contamination [ 13] and the frequency of exposure to risk factors [ 51 ].	"camels	95	101	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""camels"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This finding is in harmony with the studies conducted in Saudi Arabia [ 8, 43] who reported a higher seroprevalence in adult than young camels.	"camels	136	142	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""camels"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
There was no statistically significant sex - linked difference in seroprevalence between male ( 49. 43 %; 95% CI: 42. 0, 56. 86) and female ( 47. 85 %; 95% CI: 41. 0, 54. 65) camels.

Comparison of the diagnosis of T. gondii infection of camels by DAT and ELISA showed moderate agreement ( Kappa = 0. 41, P < 0. 0001 ).	"camels	54	60	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""camels"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We think that the discrepancies between the results of DAT and ELISA might be ascribed to the difference in the sensitivity and specificity of the tests in camel.	"camel	156	161	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""camel"", ""start_span"": 156, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
It has also been reported that test performances may vary when applied on different animal species [ 60 ].	"animal	84	90	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""animal"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
However, literature with regards to validation of this kit for camels was not accessible; consequently comparison of our results with others couldn ’ t be made possible.	"camels	63	69	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""camels"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The high seropositivity and moderately high rate of isolation of viable tissue cysts from edible organs in the current study might be of great public health significance.	"cysts	79	84	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cysts"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
This is due to the deep rooted habit of consumption of raw camel milk, offal ( liver) and to a lesser extent, meat by the pastoral communities of the study area.	"camel	59	64	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""camel"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In the absence of a vaccine for camels and the difficulty in changing the pastoral extensive livestock management system to intensive management to reduce the prevalence of the disease, prevention of the disease through education of pastoralists remains a better alternative and perhaps a more economically feasible option to combat the disease.	"camels	32	38	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""camels"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The limitations of the current study include interviewee recall bias, the relatively small number of camels considered for bioassay and the inability to genotype the isolates due to a shortage of resources.

Therefore, prevention of toxoplasmosis through biosecurity measures, education of pastoralists about the identified risks and further investigation to unravel the economic and public health implications of the high prevalence of T. gondii in the area deserves consideration.

Our finding that having a chronic disease was related to a more advanced SOC of the readiness to quit is consistent with findings of two previous cohort studies indicating that, in addition to cigarette costs, health status is the most important reason for quitting smoking [ 65, 69 ].

Together with K76T, substitutions at positions 72, 74, and 75 form complex CQR pfcrt exon 2 haplotypes that correspond to the geographical origins of CQ resistance [ 6 ].	"pfcrt	79	84	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""pfcrt"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
However, it is unclear how these CQR pfcrt haplotypes arose due to the lack of previous genetic characterization of parasites during the periods of CQ resistance emergence.	"pfcrt	37	42	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""pfcrt"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Characterization of pfcrt haplotypes from laboratory - adapted P. falciparum clones provided strong support for these two independent origins of CQ resistance, and the invasion of CQR parasites from Southeast Asia to Africa [ 5 ], [ 6 ].	"pfcrt	20	25	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""pfcrt"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Since these pfcrt substitutions were associated with a different genetic background [ 6 ], [ 10 ], it was argued that PNG represented another independent focus of CQ resistance [ 9 ].

When grouped into ecological zones, populations from the PNG eastern highlands and Island Melanesia had higher haplotype diversities than those from the other ecological zones, although the difference was not statistically significant ( ANOVA; p = 0. 106) ( Table S1 ). Pfcrt haplotype diversities did not vary substantially over time along the WNG coast, but in both PNG coasts and eastern highlands the levels of diversity showed substantial fluctuations, with an appreciable increase over time in the PNG eastern highlands ( Figure 2 ).

In PNG, malaria transmission is most intense in coastal lowlands where both temperature and rainfall remain high throughout the year, whereas in the highlands, transmission is epidemic and coincides with the conclusion of the rainy season [ 15 ].

Increased contact and the opening of the Highland Highways facilitated the movement of people and malaria parasites from the highly malarious coastal areas to the highlands, while many highlanders recruited as wage laborers in lowland plantations served as parasite reservoirs when they returned to the highlands.

This K76N substitution was previously experimentally induced when the CQS laboratory clone 106 / 1, which already had six of the seven pfcrt mutations found in CQR parasites from Asia and Africa, was exposed to high levels of CQ [ 31 ].	"pfcrt	135	140	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""pfcrt"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
However, it is unclear whether the 76N bearing parasite we identified in this study was CQR, since it was associated with a different pfcrt genetic background.	"pfcrt	134	139	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""pfcrt"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Using samples collected from 12 locations in PNG during the early 1980s, Mehlotra et al. [ 13] found a high frequency ( 97 %; 33 / 34) of the CQR SVMNT pfcrt haplotype, which was consistent with a nation - wide epidemiological survey reporting widespread CQ resistance conducted during that period [ 33 ].

Of the 34 amino acid substitutions observed in our samples, 20 are considered to be non - conservative, involving a side - chain property change in either polarity and / or charge that might affect the function of the protein.

In particular, mutant pfcrt haplotypes harboring the I63T substitution persisted through time and later dispersed into multiple regions, suggesting that these haplotypes may reflect a drug tolerant if not resistant phenotype ( Figures 3 – 6 ).

It remains unclear how the historical use of other antimalarials prior to our earliest samples ( 1959) might have contributed to the selection of pfcrt alleles observed in this study.

Quinacrine resistance was first noted in P. falciparum from the Wewak - Aitape region along the north coast of New Guinea in 1944 [ 37 ].	"Quinacrine	0	10	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Quinacrine"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We did observe in our earliest sample from the same region ( ESP61) a non - synonymous substitution ( F48L) at relatively high frequency ( 6. 1 %; 3 / 49) ( Figure 3 ), which might reflect previous selection by quinacrine and warrants further studies.

Four factors may have contributed to the unexpectedly higher levels of pfcrt exon 2 genetic diversity in parasites from the PNG eastern highlands and Island Melanesia.	"pfcrt	71	76	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""pfcrt"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
While variable levels of travel among islands within each archipelago were noted [ 43 ], more recently extensive human contact has been essential for gene flow between parasites on different islands [ 44 ], [ 45 ].	"human	113	118	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In contrast to high transmission areas where competition among different genetic strains is intense [ 46 ], even in the absence of continuous CQ selection, genetic drift may have maintained these non - synonymous substitutions in small parasite populations as suggested by low rates of infection in these low transmission areas.	"infection	286	295	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""infection"", ""start_span"": 286, ""end_span"": 295, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Third, host immune status played an important role in the occurrence of multiple infections.	"infections	81	91	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""infections"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Lastly, differences in host genetics may have affected the degree to which populations living in different ecological regions were susceptible to infection by multiple genetic strains of P. falciparum.	"infection	146	155	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""infection"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 155, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Conversely in low transmission areas, host selection against parasites might be less severe, thus allowing slightly less fit parasite strains, i. e. those with only one or two pfcrt mutations, to evolve and persist.	"pfcrt	176	181	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""pfcrt"", ""start_span"": 176, ""end_span"": 181, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Genetic characterization of P. falciparum in the Pacific from the period of CQ resistance emergence revealed that prior to complete CQ selective sweep, pfcrt exon 2 was highly diverse, highlighted by a number of previously undescribed substitutions including several implicated in CQ resistance, consistent with in situ evolution of resistance within the Pacific.	"pfcrt	152	157	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""pfcrt"", ""start_span"": 152, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In addition to CQ selection, isolation among parasite populations and reduced strain competition in small parasite populations, combined with lowered acquired immunity and genetic resistance to malaria among hosts in low transmission areas, might have been crucial to the evolution and initial establishment of CQR P. falciparum in the Pacific.	"malaria	194	201	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""malaria"", ""start_span"": 194, ""end_span"": 201, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
These data suggest that populations at the peripheries of malaria endemic areas may be the most crucial to monitor for parasites evolving tolerance and resistance to currently used antimalarials.

Only two branches directly stemming from the wildtype pfcrt haplotype contained hypothetical internal nodes ( Figure 5 ), indicating that most of these constructed haplotypes were derived from simpler haplotypes that were also present in our data set.

Since malaria endemicity in the Pacific varies by altitude and latitude [ 15 ], [ 16 ], in addition to comparisons among all samples, individual samples were assigned to one of five ecological zones: ( 1) PNG eastern highlands, ( 2) WNG coast, ( 3) PNG coasts, ( 4) PNG Papuan Plateau, and ( 5) Island Melanesia, consisting of New Hebrides ( now Vanuatu) and Solomon Islands ( Figure 1 ).

In addition, this strategy supported the reconstruction of functional skeletal muscle tissue in a rodent volumetric muscle loss injury model.	"injury	128	134	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""injury"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Towards this end, we proposed a novel and simple cell delivery method that enables reconstruction of viable, large tissues in vivo for restoration of volumetric tissue injury through an efficient vascularization strategy.

Furthermore, this cell delivery technique using C2C12 cells and human muscle progenitor cells ( hMPCs) was applied to a rodent volumetric muscle loss ( VML) model; moreover, histological and functional recovery was evaluated to determine the possibility for applications to treat critical - size muscle defects.	"human	64	69	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
To investigate the feasibility of restoring volumetric muscle tissues by multiple cell injections in a progressive manner, C2C12 cells were subcutaneously injected in athymic mice, and the volume of the newly formed tissues was measured at pre - determined injection points for comparison.

In this comparison, total volume ( 1. 2 ml) and cell number was set to be equal between multiple ( 4 × 0. 3 ml per injection) and single injection ( 1. 2 ml for one injection ); furthermore, 4 progressive cell injections were selected as more than 4 injections would yield an unimplantable volume for single injection to the animal.

Throughout the reconstructed tissue, viable MHC + muscle fiber - like structures and cells were clearly visualized as indicated by the dotted lines ( Fig. 3b, first row ).	"MHC	44	47	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MHC"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The number and area of vWF + vessels (/ field) in the progressive injection samples significantly increased, as compared to that of the single cell injection group ( Fig. 3c - i, c - ii, Student ’ s t - test, * P < 0. 05 ).	"vWF	23	26	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""vWF"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In contrast, inner area of implants constructed by single cell injection showed the lowest area of vWF + vessels, and there were no significant differences in number, maturation and percentage of blood vessels among inner, middle, outer areas ( see Supplementary Fig.	"vWF	99	102	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""vWF"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The percentage of collagen I + area of inner TA and outer TA was quantified ( n = 4, 3 random fields per each area in each sample) ( see Supplementary Fig.	"collagen I	18	28	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""collagen I"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In addition, a few fluorescently labeled - GFP + C2C12 cells at the surface site of the TA muscle are not involved in the muscle formation as indicated by white arrowheads.	"GFP	43	46	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GFP"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

Quantitative results of vascularization indicated that only progressive hMPCs injections showed increased vascularization, in terms of number and area of vWF + vessels (/ field) ( n = 3 – 4, 6 – 10 fields per sample, ANOVA and Tukey test, P < 0. 05) ( Fig. 6b, c ), while the degree of vascularization was not statistically different among the no treatment, gel only and single hMPCs injection groups ( ANOVA and Tukey test, P > 0. 05 ).

Meanwhile, the degree of vascularization between inner region and outer region in each group was not statistically different in terms of the number and area of vWF + vessels (/ field ), maturation index (%) and percentage of different vessel sizes ( data not shown, Student ’ s t - test, P > 0. 05 ).

Currently, efficient method is available to treat the volumetric tissue defect; therefore, we developed an effective cell delivery method to construct a large size muscle tissue through an efficient vascularization process in vivo. Our results from histological and immunohistochemical analysis demonstrate that muscle cell delivery by multiple cell injection in a progressive manner facilitated large scale muscle (> mm) tissue formation in an ectopic mouse model, and the reconstructed tissue is well - integrated with the host vascular system and neuronal ingrowth.

When this technique was applied to a skeletal muscle injury model with a critical volumetric defect, the progressive cell injection demonstrated enhanced muscle tissue reconstruction and improved functional recovery when compared with single injection.

Since the volume of 1. 2 ml for the single injection can prepare 1. 2 cm3 in dimension (> 1 × 1 × 1 cm ), the cells localized to the center of the fibrin gel will encounter a hypoxic condition with limited oxygen diffusion from the host vessels1151620, and the result will be increased cell necrosis.

Due to extreme drought conditions during the study, animals were in poor condition ( based on comparisons of weight with non - drought years, emaciated appearance and dull, rough fur) when collected [ 33 ], but all females used in this study survived and were successfully maintained in captivity.

Experimental enclosures constructed from 16 mm thick white melamine coated particle board ( whiteboard panels, Laminex Industries, Tullamarine, Victoria, Australia; n = 3; Fig 1A) were designed with five compartments, one inner containing 2 females and 4 outer each housing a male, which were covered by clear perspex sheets to facilitate observation and video recording.	"melamine	59	67	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""melamine"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Holes ( 3 mm diameter) were drilled every 30 mm around the base and top of the four outer walls of the enclosures to allow air flow and in two lines near the base of the walls between the male and female compartments to facilitate movement of animal scents.

An observer ( MLP) was present in the room during all night hours, and most hours during the day, to record direct observations and ensure no animals became trapped or injured.

Prior to each experiment, animals were genotyped using seven microsatellite markers as described in Parrott et al. [ 30, 31 ].	"animals	26	33	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

Last male sperm precedence operates in the agile antechinus [ 26, 32 ], so females may be able to influence the paternity of their young by trading up to genetically superior males during their most fertile periods [ 42 ].

Female agile antechinus store sperm in specialised isthmic crypts in their oviducts for up to 15 days [ 13, 34, 48] providing time and a suitable environment for sperm competition.

In natural populations, larger males may also secure more matings and sire more young ([ 14 ], MLP unpub data ), but ex situ research into female mate choice shows that female agile antechinus do not choose males based on size [ 30 ].

Although female antechinus entered the enclosures of the same males, two females chose to mate with the same male in only one of 14 trials.	"antechinus	16	26	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""antechinus"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Female antechinus can determine the difference between scents from more and less genetically similar males and prefer chemosensory cues from genetically dissimilar males [ 31 ], suggesting that the process of mate choice in this experiment was influenced by these cues ( see review in [ 54 ]).	"antechinus	7	17	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""antechinus"", ""start_span"": 7, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Firstly, animals used in this experiment were collected during severe drought conditions which significantly decreased weight, survival and litter sizes in the wild [ 33 ].	"animals	9	16	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This probably also influenced fertility in the captive population used in this study, despite the availability of increased nutrition, because animals were collected less than one month prior to the breeding season and were in poor condition [ 33 ].	"animals	143	150	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Additionally, previous studies have shown that antechinus can have a lower breeding success in captivity than in the wild ( e. g. [ 57 ]).	"antechinus	47	57	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""antechinus"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

Our results indicate that small intestine pathology can be induced in mice by intraluminal administration of poly I: C and that this is exacerbated by subsequent oral delivery of a relevant dietary antigen.	"mice	70	74	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
However, uncontrolled activation of these pathways may lead to pathology, as demonstrated in studies using intraperitoneal ( ip) administration of double stranded RNA ( dsRNA) that induces overactivation of TLR3 signalling [ 2 ], [ 3 ], [ 4 ], [ 5 ].

For the first set of regressions with M12 included, Table 4 indicates mainly positive relationships signifying more thickening than thinning as maternal TSH levels increased.	"TSH	153	156	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TSH"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

When M12 ’ s data were removed from the regression analysis, only two of the regions remained, namely right inferior supramarginal gyrus with first - trimester TSH levels and left pericallosal sulcus with second - trimester ( see Table 5 ).

The similar patterns across both sets of figures indicate the effect was not driven by this outlier, signifying that even mildly elevated maternal TSH can disrupt cortical development in this region.

Current findings provide preliminary support for our hypothesis that children exposed gestationally to insufficient TH due to mother ’ s hypothyroidism will show atypical cortical development reflecting the severity and timing of her condition.	"hypothyroidism	137	151	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hypothyroidism"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
However, only one of the regions differentiating groups was associated with severity of hypothyroidism in the mother ( based on subgroup analysis ), namely left fusiform gyrus.	"hypothyroidism	88	102	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hypothyroidism"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Cortical thinning in HYPO was observed in left fusiform gyrus and insula and in right frontomarginal sulcus, inferior parietal gyrus, and precuneus.	"HYPO	21	25	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HYPO"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Stratification by severity of maternal hypothyroidism ( in first half of pregnancy) revealed that, relative to the Mild subgroup, the Severe subgroup manifested thinning in left fusiform gyrus and also left orbitofrontal sulcus and right orbital gyrus.	"maternal hypothyroidism	30	53	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""maternal hypothyroidism"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Consistent findings from between - and within - group analyses in the left fusiform gyrus suggest that this region is quite sensitive to severe maternal hypothyroidism, as the Severe subgroup was likely driving the difference with controls.	"maternal hypothyroidism	144	167	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""maternal hypothyroidism"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 167, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
By contrast, the Severe subgroup showed thinning relative to Mild in inferior frontal areas ( viz ., left medial orbitofrontal sulcus and right orbital gyrus ), signifying that since stratification was based on mothers ’ TSH levels from the first half of pregnancy, some anterior parts of the cortex had a very early need for TH.	"TSH	221	224	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TSH"", ""start_span"": 221, ""end_span"": 224, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The thinning observed across analyses suggests that both early and later aspects of corticogenesis may be disrupted by maternal hypothyroidism ( 32 ).	"maternal hypothyroidism	119	142	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""maternal hypothyroidism"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Also, disturbances in the antioxidant defense system can lead to reduced survival of proliferating neurons during early gestation, as also seen in a murine model of maternal hypothyroidism ( 55 ).	"maternal hypothyroidism	165	188	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""maternal hypothyroidism"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 188, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
By contrast, regression results showed that maternal TSH levels were primarily correlated with CT in left frontal regions, whereas effects were more widespread in the right hemisphere.	"TSH	53	56	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TSH"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Since effects were primarily posterior in the right hemisphere and since developmental progression seems to be in a posterior - to - anterior direction, this suggests the right hemisphere may lag behind the left both developmentally and in vulnerability to hypothyroidism.	"hypothyroidism	257	271	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hypothyroidism"", ""start_span"": 257, ""end_span"": 271, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Separate regressions with and without outliers also suggest different specific effects depending on whether hypothyroidism is severe or not.	"hypothyroidism	108	122	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""hypothyroidism"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Explanations for cortical thickening based on rodent evidence may also reflect different aspects of cortical migration.	"rodent	46	52	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""rodent"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
First, due to diminishment of the glial scaffold needed for radial migration toward the cortical plate ( 22 ), some neurons may have remained in lower layers or even WM, thus giving the appearance of a longer – and hence thicker – human cortex.	"human	231	236	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 231, ""end_span"": 236, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Alternatively, the increased tangential and decreased radial migration associated with TH insufficiency may mean that some regions had augmented number of neurons as opposed to others that had fewer neurons ( see above discussion on thinning and migration ).	"TH insufficiency	87	103	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""TH insufficiency"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Finally, since maternal hypothyroidism is known to disrupt the balance between astrocytes and oligodendrocytes ( i. e ., fewer oligodendrocytes, more astrocytes) ( 57 ), this may mean that the number of exposed unmyelinated axons is increased leading to more GM than WM, which in FreeSurfer can also appear as increased thickening of the cortex.	"maternal hypothyroidism	15	38	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""maternal hypothyroidism"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
These laterality effects are to our knowledge unique and not similarly reported in the rodent literature.	"rodent	87	93	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""rodent"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Our observations of a broad range of cortical regions with atypical morphology in the offspring of hypothyroid women have important implications for the daily functioning of their children.

Furthermore, this finding may be a prelude to recent reports of increased emotional problems they exhibit as adults ( 67, 68 ).	"emotional problems	74	92	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""emotional problems"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Our findings also revealed that thickening effects in some regions, such as the postcentral gyrus and sulcus and pericallosal sulcus, which are important for sensory processing, but these disappeared once outliers were removed, suggesting that central regions may be especially vulnerable to severe TH deficiency in pregnancy.	"TH deficiency	299	312	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""TH deficiency"", ""start_span"": 299, ""end_span"": 312, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
It is important to note that Korevaar and colleagues recently showed that for normothyroid women, those with early - to - mid pregnancy levels at the extremities of the normal range had children with lower IQs and smaller cortical volumes ( 47 ).	"women	91	96	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""women"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Although this study is unique because it includes offspring of hypothyroid women followed for a minimum of 10 – 12 years from or shortly after pregnancy and detailed assessments ( described elsewhere) and structural ( 14, 15) and functional ( in progress) MRI scans, our study is also subject to a number of limitations.	"women	75	80	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""women"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Also, the age range of our sample spans when the normal age - trajectory for cortical thickening reaches its peak and then starts to thin ( 60, 71 ); consequently, HYPO ’ s observed thickening can reflect either a permanent defect or a delay in development relative to controls.	"HYPO	164	168	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HYPO"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 168, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Furthermore, although we had thyroid information on most mothers, many had only TSH data and in most cases, only a single measurement per trimester.	"TSH	80	83	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TSH"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Thickening was more common and extensive than thinning and appeared to reflect early TH insufficiency.	"TH insufficiency	85	101	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""TH insufficiency"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Future studies also need to examine the relations between aspects of cortical development and higher - order cognitive and sociobehavioral functions in order to better characterize the full impact of maternal hypothyroidism on the progeny.

At the protein level, MITF is modified post - transcriptionally and has been shown to be phosphorylated at multiple sites leading to either increase in transcriptional activation or decrease in protein stability [ 14 ], [ 15 ], [ 16 ], [ 17 ].

The other miRNAs tested, miR - 27, miR - 32 and miR - 101 did not show significant effects on luciferase expression in this assay ( Fig. 2B ).	"luciferase	94	104	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""luciferase"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
All Mitf 3 ′ UTR sequences in 11 vertebrate species analysed contain the miR - 27, miR - 25 / 32 / 92 / 363 / 367 and the miR - 101 / 144 binding sites ( Fig. 1B ).	"Mitf	4	8	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mitf"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The different results in melanoma cells as compared to HEK293 cells might be explained by different levels of endogenous miRNA expression in these cell types.	"melanoma	25	33	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""melanoma"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Thus, we detect no cooperation among the miRNA molecules with respect to effects on Mitf.	"Mitf	84	88	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mitf"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
When determining how effective each mutation was in our assays, expression of luciferase from the mutated vector alone was compared to expression from the mutated vector when co - transfected with the appropriate miRNA.	"luciferase	78	88	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""luciferase"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
These results indicate that miR - 148 is able to downregulate Mitf expression by binding to the 148 / 152B binding site.	"Mitf	62	66	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mitf"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Mutating miRNA binding sites affects the Mitf mRNA.	"Mitf	41	45	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mitf"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The four target sites for miR - 137 in the Mitf 3 ′ UTR sequence, 137A ( 2495 – 2501 ), 137B ( 2782 – 2788 ), 137C ( 2842 – 2848) and 137D ( 3061 – 3067) were mutated seperatly.	"Mitf	43	47	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mitf"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
When all the miR - 137 binding sites are functional, miR - 137 reduced expression from the luciferase reporter to only 10% ( p = 0. 0015) compared to the vector alone ( Fig. 3B ).	"luciferase	91	101	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""luciferase"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
When miR - 137 was co - transfected with a reporter construct containing the mutant site 137A, expression from the luciferase reporter was 7% compared to the vector alone ( p < 0. 0001 ).	"luciferase	115	125	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""luciferase"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
This suggests that the luciferase vector has binding sites for miR - 137.	"luciferase	23	33	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""luciferase"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Indeed, our search for miR - 137 binding sites in the luciferase gene itself resulted in 3 matching sequences.	"luciferase	54	64	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""luciferase"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
It is also possible that the miR - 137 is affecting other components ( genes / transcripts) that are involved in the transcription of the luciferase gene.	"luciferase	138	148	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""luciferase"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
When three or all four miR - 137 binding sites were mutated simultaneously, the mutated vector alone was unable to express the luciferase gene ( data not shown ).	"luciferase	127	137	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""luciferase"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
miR - 137 has previously been shown to target Mitf by acting through the best conserved miR - 137 target sites [ 31 ].	"Mitf	46	50	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mitf"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
However, in that study, only a portion of the Mitf 3 ′ UTR sequence was used in the analysis [ 31 ].	"Mitf	46	50	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mitf"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Our results therefore confirm the role of miR - 137 in regulating Mitf expression.	"Mitf	66	70	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mitf"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Site 124 / 506A is located at 548 - 554 and site 124 / 506B at 1639 - 1646 in the mMitf 3 ′ UTR sequence.	"mMitf	82	87	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""mMitf"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
When both binding sites are functional, miR - 124 positively affects luciferase expression up to 3 fold compared to expression from the vector alone in HEK293 cells ( p = 0. 0086) ( Fig. 3C ).	"luciferase	69	79	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""luciferase"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
When both binding sites were mutated, miR - 124 did not result in increased expression of the luciferase reporter, at least not as effectively as when both potential binding sites were functional ( 146% expression, p = 0. 1864 ).	"luciferase	94	104	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""luciferase"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
These results suggest that miR - 124 leads to positive effects on the Mitf mRNA by binding to the 124 / 506A binding site.	"Mitf	70	74	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mitf"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
miR - 148 and miR - 137 affect expression of the endogenous MITF	"MITF	60	64	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MITF"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
MeWo cells express less MITF than the 501mel cells used previously.	"MITF	24	28	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MITF"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
When miR - 137 was transfected into MeWo cells, the level of MITF mRNA was reduced to 68% ( Cp value 22. 3, p = 0. 0069) compared to 100% in untreated cells ( No - miR, Cp value 21. 7 ).	"MITF	61	65	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MITF"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Similarily, when miR - 148 was transfected into these cells, MITF mRNA level was reduced to 48% ( Cp value 22. 8, p = 0. 0051) compared to untreated cells.	"MITF	61	65	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MITF"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Simultaneous transfection with miR - 137 and miR - 148 did not result in further effects on MITF expression as it reduced expression to 67% ( Cp value 22. 3, p = 0. 0051 ), which is similar to the reduction seen with miR - 137 alone ( Fig. 4A ).	"MITF	92	96	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MITF"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Thus, these miRNAs do not seem to work synergistically in downregulating MITF.	"MITF	73	77	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MITF"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

Western blot analysis on MITF protein levels in MeWo cells, when transfected with miR - 124, miR - 137, miR - 148 or miR - 137 and miR - 148 combined.	"MITF	25	29	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MITF"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The effects of miRNAs on MITF protein level were also tested in MeWo cells and confirmed our previous findings ( Fig. 4B ).	"MITF	25	29	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MITF"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
When the cells were transfected with either miR - 137, miR - 148 or simultaneously with both miR - 137 and miR - 148, MITF protein levels were reduced.	"MITF	118	122	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MITF"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Also, when miR - 124 was transfected, higher MITF protein levels were observed ( Fig. 4B ).	"MITF	45	49	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MITF"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Consistent with previous results, cells simultaneously transfected with the luciferase vector construct, the miR - 148 and the anti - miR - 148 showed that the anti - miR148 molecule effectively inhibited the effects of miR - 148 ( Fig. 5A ).	"luciferase	76	86	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""luciferase"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Similarly, the effects of miR - 137 and miR - 148 on endogenous MITF mRNAs are inhibited when MeWo cells were co - transfected with anti - miRNAs ( Fig. 5B ).	"MITF	64	68	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MITF"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
These results further verifies that the effects on Mitf mRNA are specific to these microRNAs.	"Mitf	51	55	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mitf"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Expression in the melanoma cell lines 501mel and MeWo was around 1. 5 fold less than expression in HEK293 cells ( Fig. 6 ).	"melanoma	18	26	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""melanoma"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
However in 501mel cells, miR - 101 downregulated reporter gene expression at the two highest concentrations used suggesting that it may play a role in melanocytes or melanoma cells.	"melanoma	166	174	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""melanoma"", ""start_span"": 166, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The results of this analysis suggest direct effects on the Mitf mRNA.	"Mitf	59	63	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mitf"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
None of the miR - 137 - mutations restore luciferase expression to the level observed with the negative control.	"luciferase	42	52	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""luciferase"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
This might indicate that all the miR - 137 binding sites contribute to the regulation of Mitf.	"Mitf	89	93	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mitf"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
miR - 137 and miR - 148 both led to reduced levels of MITF mRNA and protein.	"MITF	54	58	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MITF"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Transfection with anti - miR - 137 similarly blocked the effects of miR - 137 on the endogenous MITF mRNA ( Fig. 5B ).	"MITF	96	100	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MITF"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Combining both miR - 137 and miR - 148 did not result in added effects on endogenous MITF mRNA levels.	"MITF	85	89	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MITF"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The 137C, 137D and 148 / 152B binding sites are all located in close proximity to each other in the Mitf - 3 ′ UTR sequence ( Fig. 1A ).	"Mitf	100	104	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mitf"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The fact that miR - 137 has an effect in MeWo cells ( q - RT - PCR) and not in 501mel cells might be due to the fact that MITF mRNA levels are higher in 501mel cells than in MeWo cells.	"MITF	122	126	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MITF"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
miR - 124 resulted in increased luciferase expression as seen using the reporter gene construct in HEK293 cells.	"luciferase	32	42	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""luciferase"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Interestingly, searching for miR - 137 binding sites within the Mitf 3 ′ UTR sequence of 11 vertebrate species revealed that all species have at least two miR - 137 binding sites and some species have three or four binding sites.	"Mitf	64	68	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mitf"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

Upregulation of miR - 137 in lymph node metastasis in colon cancer has also been observed [ 48 ].	"colon cancer	54	66	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""colon cancer"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The 3 ′ UTR sequences of Mitf in 11 vertebrate species all contain the two conserved miR - 148 / 152 binding sites.	"Mitf	25	29	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mitf"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Microarray analysis revealed that miR - 148b is downregulated in early melanoma progression, although it was not confirmed using qRT - PCR [ 30 ].	"melanoma	71	79	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""melanoma"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Similarly, miR - 152 was shown to be downregulated in a highly invasive melanoma cell line ( Mel Im) [ 30 ].	"invasive melanoma	63	80	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""invasive melanoma"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Other studies have suggested that miR - 148 and miR - 152 can play a role as tumor suppressors.	"tumor	77	82	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumor"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
miR - 148 expression has been shown to be downregulated in tissue samples from undifferentiated gastric cancer compared to normal tissue [ 49 ].	"gastric cancer	96	110	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""gastric cancer"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The binding sites for microRNAs miR - 124 / 506 are very well conserved in the Mitf 3 ′ UTR sequence.	"Mitf	79	83	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mitf"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Ten vertebrate species contain both miR - 124 / 506 binding site; the Loxodonta africana sequence only contains 124 / 506B.	"Loxodonta africana	70	88	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Loxodonta africana"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
It has not been shown previously that miR - 124 and / or miR - 506 can affect Mitf mRNA.	"Mitf	78	82	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mitf"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
However, our results show upregulation by miR - 124 in melanoma cells, rather than downregulation.	"melanoma	55	63	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""melanoma"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The possible role of miR - 124 in regulating the expression of Mitf during eye development needs to be tested further.	"Mitf	63	67	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mitf"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
However, this is unlikely to play a role in regulating Mitf mRNA through effects on the 3 ′ UTR since our reporter construct only contained 3 ′ UTR sequences.	"Mitf	55	59	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mitf"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In humans, miR - 137 has 857 conserved targets, with a total of 949 conserved sites and 120 poorly conserved sites.	"humans	3	9	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""humans"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
It is therefore unlikely that these miRNAs exclusively affect Mitf expression.	"Mitf	62	66	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mitf"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Comparing these potential PAS sites in the 3 ′ UTR sequences of Mitf from 11 vertebrate species revealed a well conserved PAS located at 2837 - 2842, adjacent to the miR - 137 C binding site ( Fig. 1A ).	"Mitf	64	68	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mitf"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The conservation of several of the alternative polyadenylation signals found in the 3 ′ UTR sequences of Mitf suggests their significance.	"Mitf	105	109	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mitf"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Thus, Mitf might be able to evade miRNA - mediated regulation using the alternative polyadenylation sites, thus leading to a shorter transcript lacking the miRNA binding sequences.	"Mitf	6	10	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mitf"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Thus, in the case of MITF, microRNAs do not act alone in mediating regulation through the 3 ′ UTR sequences.	"MITF	21	25	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MITF"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
It is clear that miRNA function is diverse and its role in cancer and other disease is complex.	"cancer	59	65	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""cancer"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Some miRNAs seem to have a tissue - specific function like miR - 124 in neurons wheras other miRNAs are found more universally. Mitf functions in diverse cell types and may therefore be regulated by different miRNAs in the different tissues.

Dysregulation of these microRNAs, or loss of the binding sites in the 3 ′ UTR, might lead to increased expression of Mitf, thus leading to differentiation and cell - cycle arrest.

For Or24a neurons, two of the four odours ( octanol and propyl acetate) were reliably identified by the classifier with high levels of performance ( perfect performance = 1. 0, observed performance = 0. 95 for both octanol and propyl acetate; see figure 2, blue lines ).	"Or24a	4	9	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Or24a"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
For Or74a neurons, the classifier was highly effective for all four odours; significant performance was reached within 150 – 400 ms of stimulus onset and maximum performance of 0. 80 – 0. 87 was reached.	"Or74a	4	9	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Or74a"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In the absence of information from the temporal pattern, spike count alone yielded significantly lower discrimination performance ( p < 0. 01) in at least one phase for all OSN / odour combinations, with the exception of Or74a / propyl acetate ( figure 2 and electronic supplementary material, S1 ).

Or24a was strongly inhibited during the first minute of exposure to octanol ( 0 spikes s − 1 ); it then recovered to 2 spikes s − 1 but still showed a significant reduction in activity over the 5 min of stimulation ( p < 0. 0001, Kruskal – Wallis test ).	"Or24a	0	5	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Or24a"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Or24a neurons showed a significant increase in their response to 1 s propyl acetate following 5 min exposure to propyl acetate ( mean firing rate = 38. 3 ± 2. 4 spikes s − 1 before exposure; 52. 8 ± 1. 1 spikes s − 1 after exposure, Mann – Whitney U - test, p ≤ 0. 001 ).	"Or24a	0	5	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Or24a"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The spontaneous activity of Or24a OSNs was affected by 5 min exposure to 2 - heptanone and propyl acetate, as shown by significant reductions in pre - stimulus (‘− 1 ’) firing rates following exposure.	"Or24a	28	33	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Or24a"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
For Or74a, the only significant change in activity after 5 min exposure to an odour was seen for octanol, where exposure significantly reduced firing rates during 1 s stimulation ( Mann – Whitney U - test, p = 0. 004 ).	"Or74a	4	9	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Or74a"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The significant reduction in the Or74a response to octanol that was observed following 5 min exposure was also seen after 20 min exposure; indeed, the effect continued into the second after the stimulus offset.	"Or74a	33	38	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Or74a"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
We used the PSTH classifier to explore the performance of Or74a neurons in a forced three - choice ‘ discrimination ’ task ( octanol, 2 - heptanone, propyl acetate) following 5 and 20 min pre - exposure to octanol.	"Or74a	58	63	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Or74a"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Two - tailed t - tests showed that the discrimination performance of Or74a neurons was not significantly different before and after exposure to octanol for either 5 or 20 min ( electronic supplementary material, S2 ).	"Or74a	69	74	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Or74a"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Finally, we extended odour exposure time to the upper limit possible in this short - lived stage of the fly ' s life cycle.	"fly	104	107	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""fly"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
There was a significant reduction in the strong response to octanol in Or74a OSNs compared with control, non - exposed, age - matched OSNs, which was seen both in the 1 s stimulation and in the second following stimulus offset ( Mann – Whitney U - test, p = 0. 009 and < 0. 001, respectively ).	"Or74a	71	76	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Or74a"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
However, even after 3 days of exposure, these Or74a OSNs were still showing a firing rate of about 60 Hz during stimulation.	"Or74a	46	51	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Or74a"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Some cross - adaptation was seen, in the shape of a significant decline in the activity of Or74a OSNs in response to 1 s stimulation with propyl acetate ( Mann – Whitney U - test, p = 0. 007) and a significant decline in the response to 2 - heptanone in the second after stimulus offset ( Mann – Whitney U - test, p = 0. 043 ).	"Or74a	91	96	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Or74a"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Although there were significant reductions in the pre - stimulus spontaneous activity of the Or24a OSN, this was only seen with octanol; in all cases, these neurons showed very low spontaneous activity (‘− 1 ’ column ).	"Or24a	93	98	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Or24a"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Our results show that the peripheral olfactory code in Drosophila larvae contains both spike count and temporal information that can be used to identify odours, and that the temporal component increases the speed and accuracy of odour discrimination.	"Drosophila	55	65	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
It appears that in Drosophila larvae the peripheral olfactory code is based on a combinatorial code consisting of the activity of single OSNs.	"Drosophila	19	29	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In the adult fly antenna, OSNs are found in groups of two or three cells, housed in hair - like sensilla; if one OSN shows a sustained response, non - synaptic inhibition can occur in the other neuron [ 15 ].	"fly	13	16	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""fly"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Electrophysiological studies of Drosophila olfaction have used 0. 5 or 1 s odour presentations ( e. g. [ 2, 12 ]).	"Drosophila	32	42	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Temporal coding requires that ( i) neurons convey stimulus information via spike patterns beyond that available from spike count and ( ii) differences in spike pattern can modulate an animal ' s decisions even in the absence of a difference in spike count [ 16 ].	"animal	184	190	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""animal"", ""start_span"": 184, ""end_span"": 190, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We suggest that temporal information in the peripheral olfactory code may be exploited by Drosophila larvae to make decisions about behavioural outputs.	"Drosophila	90	100	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This has yet to be demonstrated in any animal.	"animal	39	45	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""animal"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Although there were some significant changes in the firing rates of OSNs following prolonged exposure to an odour, in no case did we observe complete adaptation — indeed, in the case of Or24a, 5 min exposure to propyl acetate significantly increased the response to that odour ( figure 4b ).	"Or24a	186	191	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Or24a"", ""start_span"": 186, ""end_span"": 191, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
This finding may have its roots in the ecology of this species; Drosophila eggs are deposited on a food source ( vegetable matter that is beginning to decay) by females, and under laboratory conditions larvae remain on that food source, continually bathed in food odours.	"Drosophila	64	74	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In adult flies, continuous early exposure to odours causes significant plasticity in both peripheral and central structures, perhaps indicating a role for experience in the peripheral code in this species [ 17 ].	"flies	9	14	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""flies"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Further interpretation is difficult because the way that odours bind to the receptor molecule is not known, nor do we fully understand the biochemistry of olfactory receptor function.

We conclude that, at both experimental and ecologically relevant timescales, the peripheral olfactory code in Drosophila larvae contains temporal information.

In this study, S is always equal to 1 because orthologous protein pairs need to be identified prior to being incorporated in the MePPI - In. M refers to the reliability of the method by which the interactions were identified: 0. 5 for computational prediction, and 1 for experimental measurement. N ∈ { 1, 2, …, 7} is the number of species from which the protein - protein interactions in cassava were inferred. D = [ 0, 1] refers to domain enrichment, which is the ratio of the reported DDI pairs to all interactions possibly happening among domains in a protein pair.

The resulting interolog - based PPI network of cassava, or MePPI - In, is comprised of 90, 173 interactions interconnecting 7, 209 proteins, which accounted for c. a.	"cassava	47	54	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""cassava"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

Accordingly, it might be helpful if collective information could be incorporated to support the occurrence of such predictions in cassava.	"cassava	130	137	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""cassava"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Since expression of the proteins from eleven expression datasets indicated their presence in cassava, these proteins were then considered available for the interactions among them to occur.

The MePPI - In proposed in this study is the first genome - wide protein - protein interaction network of cassava consisting of 90, 173 interactions and 7, 209 proteins.

This property of MePPI - In is considered beneficial, since it can protect cassava from any perturbation caused by endogenous and exogenous stimuli.	"cassava	75	82	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""cassava"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
It is thus presumed that the MePPI - In contains sufficient information, hence, could be utilized as the model PPI network in cassava.	"cassava	126	133	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""cassava"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Besides the network topology, functional content of proteins in MePPI - In was determined to demonstrate some PPI - based regulation in cassava.	"cassava	136	143	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""cassava"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
These corresponded to the result in the ‘ molecular function ’ class, in which a large number of the proteins were observed to have catalytic activity or binding capacity, probably acting as enzymes in metabolic pathways and transcription factors in cellular regulatory processes.

The scale has been used in large studies including older people with and without dementia [ 70] and has been translated and used in several studies [ 71, 72 ].	"dementia	81	89	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""dementia"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The type of unit was also recorded from among the following options: regular units ( RU ), special care unit for people with dementia ( SCU ), rehabilitation unit ( REU ), and other units ( OU ), mainly psychogeriatric wards.

Prevalence and persistence of PTD use among those with and without dementia were compared by Z - test for proportions.	"dementia	67	75	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""dementia"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
At baseline, the mean ( SD) age of the residents was 84. 4 ( 7. 8) years and 846 ( 72. 7 %) of them were women ( Table 1 ).	"women	105	110	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""women"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The mean ( SD) baseline CDR sum of boxes was 11. 2 ( 5. 3) and 932 ( 80. 1 %) residents had CDR ≥ 1 indicating dementia.	"dementia	111	119	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""dementia"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Antidepressants were most frequently used ( 38. 3% at baseline, 32. 7% at last follow - up ); while anti - dementia drugs were least frequently used ( 11. 3% at baseline, 0% at last follow - up ).	"dementia	107	115	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""dementia"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The prevalence of use of any PTD was high throughout the period; at baseline the prevalence was 72. 9 %, but had fallen to 63. 3% at the last follow - up.

The proportion of PTD use at two consecutive time points was high (> 50 %) throughout the period for all types of PTD, except for use of anti - dementia drugs ( Table 2 ).	"dementia	144	152	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""dementia"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Unadjusted and adjusted odds for use of PTD at one time point, given use of the same type of PTD at an earlier time point was estimated for all types of PTD except for anti - dementia drug use ( Table 3 and Fig. 2 ).

The adjusted risk for persistent use of antipsychotics at two consecutive time points was elevated when residents had higher psychosis sub - syndrome score or were younger, were male or had a longer NH stay at baseline ( Table 4 ).	"psychosis	125	134	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""psychosis"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Persistent use of anxiolytics was more common in residents without dementia.	"dementia	67	75	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""dementia"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Furthermore, less severe dementia was associated with persistent use of sedatives.	"severe dementia	18	33	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""severe dementia"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The study found that the prevalence of atypical antipsychotics was higher in residents with dementia than in residents without, but only for the first three time points.	"dementia	92	100	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""dementia"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Use of conventional antipsychotics did not differ between residents with or without dementia at any time point.	"dementia	84	92	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""dementia"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Given the strong evidence on the increased mortality risk associated with use of conventional antipsychotics in people with dementia it is rather surprising to see that they are still used to that extent.	"dementia	124	132	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""dementia"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In the present adjusted logistic regression analysis for persistent use of antipsychotic drugs at two consecutive time points, higher severity of psychosis increased the risk for persistent use of antipsychotics.	"psychosis	146	155	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""psychosis"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 155, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
However, cross - sectional studies have explored the association between NPS and use of antipsychotic drugs and found that higher total symptom load [ 80] and more severe psychosis sub - syndromes symptoms were associated with use of antipsychotics [ 11, 14, 81, 82 ].	"psychosis	171	180	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""psychosis"", ""start_span"": 171, ""end_span"": 180, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In contrast, a small Swedish 6 - month follow - up study in NH residents with dementia did not find age, gender or other personal characteristics of the residents such as P - ADL or cognitive functioning important for persistent use of antipsychotics [ 52 ].	"dementia	78	86	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""dementia"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Male and younger residents may be experienced as more threatening in their verbal or physical expressions and are physically stronger compared to women and older residents, and for this reason may be put on antipsychotic drugs.	"women	146	151	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""women"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We do not have a firm explanation for this, but it may be that newly arrived NH residents receive more attention from the staff or respond better to care that is intended to reduce stress, strain and symptoms related to dementia.	"dementia	220	228	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""dementia"", ""start_span"": 220, ""end_span"": 228, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
We found, in line with other studies, that antidepressants were the most frequently used PTD in NH residents [ 48, 49] and that the frequency did not differ between residents with or without dementia [ 85 ].

At the four first assessment time points between 1. 9 to 2. 2% of residents with CDR less than 1 were prescribed anti - dementia drugs.	"dementia	120	128	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""dementia"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
A large number of residents with a CDR score of 3 could not be tested with any dementia tests such as the Mini Mental Status Examination or the Clock Drawing Test.	"dementia	79	87	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""dementia"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Psychotropic drugs were frequently used as a long - term treatment among NH residents and were associated with severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms, but not with severity of dementia.

Quality assurance of registration of CT and MRI data sets for treatment planning of radiotherapy for head and neck cancers	"head and neck cancers	101	122	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""head and neck cancers"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In order to improve the accuracy of the treatment modeling, there are two aspects of the calculations to consider: One is choosing the correct algorithm for the specific application ( 2); the other is accurately describing the geometry of the tumor and surrounding tissues.	"tumor	243	248	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumor"", ""start_span"": 243, ""end_span"": 248, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Prior to the implementation of our current treatment planning system ( CMS FOCUS / XiO ), we implemented planning of brain tumors using MRI alone. ( 7) Our current planning system now has the ability to input imaging data from different modalities.	"brain tumors	117	129	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""brain tumors"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
We are, therefore, implementing multimodality planning for anatomical sites where enhanced tumor / organ delineation and more sophisticated dose calculations will provide benefit.	"tumor	91	96	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumor"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Therefore, a relevant question to be considered is the following: How accurate and reliable is the tumor volume depicted in the secondary ( in this case MRI) data set?	"tumor	99	104	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumor"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Having understood the practical limitations, scanning protocols can be formulated that really negate the impact of any such ( small) effects when using MR imaging to delineate the tumor and proximal tissues.	"tumor	180	185	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""tumor"", ""start_span"": 180, ""end_span"": 185, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Finally, we believe that our work shows that MR imaging can be safely used in treatment planning of radiotherapy for the head and neck; given its enhanced soft tissue delineation, it will provide an excellent tool for more discriminate contouring as we implement novel radiotherapy methods, such as intensity ‐ modulated radiotherapy. ( 18) The work also shows that “ discrepancies ” seen in perceived structure or tumor delineation in soft tissues can be assumed to be due to the imaging capabilities of the media in question rather than phantom effects from the registration process itself.
