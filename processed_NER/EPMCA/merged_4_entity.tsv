Key differences in the attribution of outpatient costs for HZ and PHN have been reported for Italy; for patients that did not develop PHN, the majority of the cost of management has been reported to be due to the cost of medication ( 83 %) whereas for patients that develop PHN a greater proportion of cost was attributed to diagnostic and investigative procedures [ 29 ].

Finally, the lack of literature relating to the wider societal burden potentially caused by HZ and PHN ( particularly with respect to the impact on caregivers and the broader implications of HZ and PHN on provision of formal and informal social care) may be considered a critical gap.

According to the distribution of CP in the nucleus, we could distinguish five different stages ( Figure 1B ): stage I resembles the localization of the CP when expressed alone, which accumulates mostly in the nucleolus; in stage II, the CP can still be detected in the nucleolus, but forms multiple intense speckles in the nucleoplasm; in stage III, speckles can still be detected, but the CP is absent from the nucleolus; in stage IV, speckles become blurred, and the nucleoplasmic signal becomes stronger but unevenly distributed; in stage V, discrete speckles can no longer be detected, and the nucleoplasm shown a strong and more evenly distributed signal.

Time - course experiments allowed us to establish the temporal sequence of the stages of CP localization: as shown in Figure 2, CP - GFP progresses through stages I – II – III – IV – V in individual cells ( Figure 2A ), and different stages coexist in the cell population ( Figure 2B ); the overall progression of stages correlates with viral DNA accumulation ( Figure 2C ), suggesting that it occurs as part of or in parallel to the development of the infection.

Based on the results from GSEA, we directly investigated the striatal mTORC1 activity in Shank3 TG mice by measuring the phosphorylation level of mTOR S2448 residue.	mTORC1,70,76,Gene/Protein	Shank3,89,95,Gene/Protein	mice,99,103,Organism/Species	mTOR,146,150,Gene/Protein	"[{""token"": ""mTORC1"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""Shank3"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""mTOR"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"	train
The phosphorylation of mTOR S2448 is predominantly associated with mTORC1 ( Copp et al ., 2009 ), and reflects its activation as S6 kinase, a downstream target of mTORC1, phosphorylates the residue in a feedback loop ( Chiang and Abraham, 2005 ).	mTOR,23,27,Gene/Protein	mTORC1,67,73,Gene/Protein	S6 kinase,129,138,Gene/Protein	mTORC1,163,169,Gene/Protein	"[{""token"": ""mTOR"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""mTORC1"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""S6 kinase"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""mTORC1"", ""start_span"": 163, ""end_span"": 169, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"	train

In addition, Shahani et al.

Together, these results suggest a high connectivity between Shank3 and the upstream regulators of mTORC1, mediated by 94 common interacting proteins involved in defined biological pathways ( for simplicity, we will refer to these 94 proteins as “ Shank3 - mTORC1 interactome ”).

The mechanism underlying the decrease in mTORC1 activity in response to interactions between Shank3 and the upstream regulators of mTORC1 in the Shank3 TG striatum remains unclear.	mTORC1,41,47,Gene/Protein	Shank3,93,99,Gene/Protein	mTORC1,131,137,Gene/Protein	Shank3,145,151,Gene/Protein	"[{""token"": ""mTORC1"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""Shank3"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""mTORC1"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""Shank3"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"	train

However, this mechanism could not explain the decrease in mTORC1 activity in the striatum of Shank3 TG mice, where Akt activity was found to be normal ( Han et al ., 2013b ).	mTORC1,58,64,Gene/Protein	Shank3,93,99,Gene/Protein	mice,103,107,Organism/Species	Akt,115,118,Gene/Protein	"[{""token"": ""mTORC1"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""Shank3"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Akt"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"	train

As per the reason why uc. 158 − is aberrantly deregulated in malignant hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, we may speculate that uc. 158 − overexpressing hepatic cancer stem cells may give rise to specific subtypes of HCC and CCA in the presence of Wnt pathway.	hepatic cancer,150,164,Disease/Disorder	HCC,214,217,Disease/Disorder	CCA,222,225,Disease/Disorder	Wnt,245,248,Gene/Protein	"[{""token"": ""hepatic cancer"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 164, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""HCC"", ""start_span"": 214, ""end_span"": 217, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""CCA"", ""start_span"": 222, ""end_span"": 225, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""Wnt"", ""start_span"": 245, ""end_span"": 248, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"	train
However, we cannot exclude that the plasticity of mature hepatocytes to differentiate in cholangiocytes may justify some common traits acquired during liver carcinogenesis. 44 45 Another potential explanation relies on the evidence that stroma is an important Wnt activator even in tumours, such as CCA, that lack CTNNB1 mutations. 27 35 Thus, further studies are warranted to explore the involvement of the stroma - induced activation of uc. 158 − driven carcinogenesis.

We have previously shown that miR - 193b mediates apoptosis through targeting of mcl - 1, 12 and the overexpression of uc. 158 − in HCC nicely fits with these data as well as with the previous work that found downregulation of miR - 193b in a subgroup of HCCs. 39 40 It is increasingly recognised that cancer cells rely on a complex network of transcripts generated from coding and non - coding genes, and that interplay of different RNA classes drives cancer progression more than a single aberration. 46 However, identification of a single molecule representing the activation of a network may prove more useful for the identification of therapeutic targets and for the implementation of screening technologies to be adopted for targeted therapy.	mcl - 1,81,88,Gene/Protein	HCC,132,135,Disease/Disorder	HCCs,255,259,Disease/Disorder	cancer,302,308,Disease/Disorder	"[{""token"": ""mcl - 1"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""HCC"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""HCCs"", ""start_span"": 255, ""end_span"": 259, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""cancer"", ""start_span"": 302, ""end_span"": 308, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"	train
