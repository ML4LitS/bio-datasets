By making use of the striking natural variation of A. thaliana accessions in interspecific PT reception, we identified ARTUMES ( ARU) as an indispensable factor for the recognition of interspecific A. lyrata PTs by A. thaliana embryo sacs.

The T - DNA allele was denoted aru - 1. A second mutant allele, aru - 2, carrying an EMS - induced premature stop - codon after aa residue 129 ( ref. 34 ), also showed an increase in interspecific OG / S ( 96. 1 %, n = 20, Fig. 4a, b, f ).

Although these experiments could not establish a mechanistic link between variation in ARU and variation in OG / S, they are not inconsistent with the hypothesis that ARU is differentially regulated in A. thaliana accessions.

At present, it is conceivable that population structure or co - segregating SNPs, which do not directly influence ARU expression or protein function, caused the GWAS peak on chromosome 1 and that ARU itself — although undoubtedly involved in interspecific PT reception — is not responsible for the observed natural variation among the 86 accessions tested.

Some of the known members in the PT reception pathway, FER and NTA, have been implicated in the perception of cell wall perturbations, pathogen resistance, and innate immunity174445.

After pollination with A. lyrata, fer heterozygous mutants show higher OG / S ( 74. 9 %) than wild - type segregants ( 61. 2 %, P < 0. 01, Supplementary Fig. 9 ), suggesting that inter - and intraspecific PT reception both involve the FER pathway.

However, we cannot rule out that the extracellular domain of FER is un - or misglycosylated at specific glycosylation sites in aru, which may allow the protein to recognize intra - but not interspecific PTs.

It is possible that even subtle differences in ARU protein levels could lead to the misglycosylation of target proteins, including FER, such that a few specific glycosylation sites remain unglycosylated.

A possible interpretation of our results is that FER, and / or yet unknown synergid ( co -) receptors, bind putative ligands from intraspecific PTs both via specific interactions with carbohydrates on the receptor protein and via direct protein – protein interactions, a mechanism similar to the proposed ‘ domain - specific model ' in mammalian sperm - egg binding47 ( Fig. 6a ).

As shown in figure 5A and supplemental figures 1 and 2, apoptotic neutrophils were not activated and their S100 A8 and S100 A9 release was associated with PCD and not inflammation or activation.

S100A8 / 9 clearly upregulates and binds to CD11b, previously shown to be a major regulator of neutrophil PCD [ 44 ], with possible anti - or pro - apoptotic effect.

In contrast, JMJD2B mutant mice showed significantly reduced alteration rates compared with WT littermates ( P = 0. 0074; Figure 5c ).

Trauma - focused psychological treatments are recommended as first - line treatments for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ), but clinicians may be concerned that the good outcomes observed in randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) may not generalize to the wide range of traumas and presentations seen in clinical practice.

This study investigated whether Cognitive Therapy for PTSD ( CT - PTSD) can be effectively implemented into a UK National Health Service Outpatient Clinic serving a defined ethnically mixed urban catchment area.

A consecutive sample of 330 patients with PTSD ( age 17 – 83) following a wide range of traumas were treated by 34 therapists, who received training and supervision in CT - PTSD.

A substantial number of randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) have established the efficacy of trauma - focused cognitive behavioral treatments ( TF - CBT) in posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) ( for reviews see Australian Centre for Posttraumatic Mental Health, 2007; Bisson et al ., 2007; Bradley, Greene, Russ, Dutra, & Westen, 2005; Kitchner, Roberts, Wilcox, & Bisson, 2012; Powers, Halpern, Ferenschak, Gillihan, & Foa, 2010; Stein et al ., 2009 ).

Some RCTs have observed high dropout rates of between 25 and 43% with trauma - focused PTSD treatments in RCTs ( e. g ., Foa et al ., 2005; Power et al ., 2002; Resick et al ., 2002; Schnurr et al, 2007 ), although the average dropout rate may not be higher than for other PTSD treatments ( Hembree et al ., 2003 ).

Gillespie, Duffy, Hackmann, and Clark ( 2002) trained therapists from a range of professional backgrounds in Cognitive Therapy for PTSD, a version of TF - CBT that builds on Ehlers and Clark ' s ( 2000) model of PTSD.

Whilst these initial studies evaluating the effectiveness of TF - CBT for PTSD are promising, they are limited in number, and further studies of larger samples of unselected patients with PTSD following the wide range of traumatic events seen in clinical settings are needed to determine the effectiveness of TF - CBT programs.

Some TF - CBT studies have correlated candidate predictors with symptom severity at the end of therapy and have generally found that patients with more severe symptoms of PTSD and depression at the beginning of treatment have more remaining symptoms at the end of treatment ( e. g ., Blanchard et al ., 2003; van Emmerik, Kamphuis, Noordhof, & Emmelkamp, 2011; van Minnen, Arntz, & Keijsers, 2002; Schulz, Resick, Huber, & Griffin, 2006 ).

The main reasons for not being suitable at the time of assessment were that the patient did not have PTSD ( n = 42 ), or first needed treatment for another primary problem such as alcohol dependence or immediate suicide risk ( n = 73 ).

Two aspects of therapist experience were coded: first, whether the therapist was a trainee or a staff therapist, and second, the therapists ' experience with CT - PTSD ( experienced was defined as having treated more than 12 patients with CT - PTSD ).

This criterion was chosen because UK treatment guidelines ( National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, 2005) recommend 8 sessions as an adequate trial of trauma - focused treatments for PTSD on the basis of prior research. 2. Attendance: Therapists indicated in the session notes whether or not the patient was often late or missed appointments without notifying the therapist. 3.

Multiple sclerosis ( MS) is a disease of the central nervous system ( CNS) that leads to chronic inflammation, demyelination, and axonal and neuronal loss, resulting in disability ( Noseworthy et al ., 2000; Weissert, 2013 ).

Geographically, rates of smoking vary considerably, with a higher prevalence of current smoking generally found in the Eastern and Atlantic provinces compared to Ontario and British Columbia. [ 12] In addition, smoking has consistently been found to be concentrated among individuals of lower socioeconomic status ( SES) in Canada [ 13] and other high income countries [ 14 ]–[ 16 ]; while higher SES has been related to increased smoking cessation .[ 17 ]–[ 20] For example, evidence from the National Population Health Survey in Canada indicated that high levels of education and household income were associated with quitting over a two year period in men and women.

While the number of EEFs at later time points ( 24 – 48 hours) was similar in WT - and puf1 (-)- infected cultures ( Figure 5A ), it was reduced in the case of puf2 (-) parasites ( Figure 5B ).

In addition, we cannot exclude a moderate impairment during liver stage development in puf2 (-) parasites, as suggested by the reduction of EEF numbers observed between 24 and 48 hours post - infection in vitro.

In vivo data suggested that, over time, Puf2 - knockout sporozoites rapidly loose infectivity in the mosquito ( Table 1 ).	"Puf2	40	44	Gene/Protein"	"mosquito	101	109	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Puf2"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""mosquito"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
To better characterize this phenomenon, we carefully analyzed puf2 (-) sporozoite development in the mosquito ( Figure 6 ).	"puf2	62	66	Gene/Protein"	"mosquito	101	109	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""puf2"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""mosquito"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Quantification of partial and complete transformation in all three parasite populations revealed that at day 29 almost all puf2 (-) sporozoites had transformed, whereas only a minor fraction of WT and puf1 (-) sporozoites exhibited signs of premature transformation ( Figure 6B ).	"puf2	123	127	Gene/Protein"	"puf1	201	205	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""puf2"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""puf1"", ""start_span"": 201, ""end_span"": 205, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Interestingly, we did not observe expression of the liver stage marker UIS4 or nuclear divisions, as seen in EEFs ( Figure 5C ), in the transformed puf2 (-) sporozoites ( Figure 6A ).

Premature transformation of puf2 (-) sporozoites in the mosquito.

Additionally, we found a ∼ 17 fold reduction of Puf1 transcript levels in puf2 (-) parasites.	"Puf1	48	52	Gene/Protein"	"puf2	74	78	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Puf1"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""puf2"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Conversely, Puf2 transcript levels were not affected in the absence of Puf1 ( Figure 7 ).	"Puf2	12	16	Gene/Protein"	"Puf1	71	75	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Puf2"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""Puf1"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
As controls, UIS4 and HSP70 mRNA levels were similar in the mutant and WT sporozoites.

The latter probably explains, at least in part, why the phenotype of puf2 (-) sporozoites recapitulates that of IK2 - knockout parasites.

Expression data from three independent experiments are shown and were normalized to the level of GFP transcripts, which are expressed under the control of the EF1alpha promoter [ 26 ]. no amplif ., no amplification.

Plasmodium sporozoites must persist and remain infectious within the salivary glands of the mosquito for many days until they are eventually transmitted to a mammalian host.

In this study, we identified a factor controlling sporozoite latency in P. berghei, the RNA - binding protein Puf2.

In the absence of Puf2, sporozoites transform prematurely in the mosquito, resulting in a severe loss of infectivity.

We show that puf2 (-) sporozoites transform prematurely in the mosquito salivary glands, as evidenced by the characteristic bulb - like structures and rounding - up of the parasites.	"puf2	13	17	Gene/Protein"	"mosquito	63	71	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""puf2"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""mosquito"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In the absence of Puf2, the proportion of transformed salivary gland sporozoites increases over time, which correlates with a progressive loss of infectivity to mice.	"Puf2	18	22	Gene/Protein"	"mice	161	165	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Puf2"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 161, ""end_span"": 165, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Interestingly, although most puf2 (-) sporozoites eventually transform into completely round forms, these forms do not progress to EEF differentiation, as shown by minimal expression of the liver stage marker UIS4 and absence of nuclear division or growth.	"puf2	29	33	Gene/Protein"	"UIS4	209	213	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""puf2"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""UIS4"", ""start_span"": 209, ""end_span"": 213, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In contrast, normal differentiation of puf2 (-) parasites is observed once sporozoites invade cultured hepatoma cells.	"puf2	39	43	Gene/Protein"	"hepatoma	103	111	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""puf2"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""hepatoma"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Collectively, these data strongly suggest that Puf2 plays a major role in preventing premature remodelling of the sporozoites prior to liver infection, but is not required for EEF differentiation.	"Puf2	47	51	Gene/Protein"	"liver infection	135	150	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""Puf2"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""liver infection"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The defects observed in puf2 (-) parasites are reminiscent of those described in IK2 - knockout parasites [ 12 ].	"puf2	24	28	Gene/Protein"	"IK2	81	84	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""puf2"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""IK2"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Signature RNA sequences that are recognized by the Puf domain vary between species and members of the Puf family, but typically contain a UGUR motif [ 35 ], [ 36 ], [ 37 ], [ 38 ].	"Puf	51	54	Gene/Protein"	"Puf	102	105	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Puf"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""Puf"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
A large number of Plasmodium genes contain UGUR motifs in their 3 ′ UTR, but their functional significance remains uncertain, especially in the context of the exceptional AT - richness of the Plasmodium genome.	"Plasmodium	18	28	Organism/Species"	"Plasmodium	192	202	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Plasmodium"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Plasmodium"", ""start_span"": 192, ""end_span"": 202, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Therefore, endogenous targets of Plasmodium Puf proteins still remain elusive.

The P. falciparum [ 22] and P. berghei ( this study) mutants now constitute potential tools to identify Puf2 target genes in Plasmodium.

Puf2 may instead participate in stabilization of IK2 transcripts.	"Puf2	0	4	Gene/Protein"	"IK2	49	52	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Puf2"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""IK2"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Therefore, presence of two Puf genes in the Plasmodium genome might be explained by overlapping or distinct roles.

In conclusion, we show here that Puf2 plays a major role in controlling sporozoite latency during host switch, possibly through the regulation of IK2.

After parasite transmission to Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes, the numbers of midgut oocysts and salivary gland sporozoites were determined at day 10 – 14 and day 18 – 25, respectively, and compared using the Kruskal - Wallis followed by Dunn ' s multiple comparison tests.

The government of Ethiopia has adopted the switch of 4HR continuation phase TB treatment for all new cases and accommodated in the latest TB treatment guideline [ 11 ].

Thus patients ’ baseline attributes ( age, gender, residence, sputum smear, type of TB, HIV status) and follow - up measures ( sputum smear, weight, drug regimen and treatment outcomes) were extracted.

On the other hand, use of rifampcin for longer period of time during the treatment of TB is associated with better outcomes [ 13] that might be related with efficacy of the drug.

Inulin is a linear polymer formed by 20 to over 60 β - 2, 1 - linked fructose monomers with a terminal glucose residue, whereas FOS are short - chain oligosaccharides with the same structure but a maximal chain length of 2 to 20 monomeric units which are generated by hydrolysis of inulin [ 28 ].

This response was markedly attenuated for the three cytokines in the presence of FOS, while inulin caused exclusively a reduction in IL - 6 levels ( Fig. 4 ).

Since FOS / inulin did not reduce the cytokine release in the absence of bacteria, our results suggest that the inhibitory effect of FOS is probably due to a direct interaction with P. aeruginosa.

The mechanism of their action is not clear, but it is thought to involve preferential utilization of oligosaccharides by host - friendly bacterial species such as bifidobacteria or lactobacilli, indicating that prebiotic substances might have the capacity to protect against infections and reduce the presence of clinically relevant pathogens in the faecal flora [ 57 ], [ 58 ].

At the posttranscriptional level ( i. e ., control of the stability and translation of mRNA ), the main controller of CCM reported so far is the carbon storage regulator ( Csr) system ( 12 – 16 ).

It is hypothesized to be involved in the switch between the two metabolisms since the BarA / UvrY two - component system is needed for the efficient transition from glycolytic to gluconeogenic metabolism ( 2 ).

The recently discovered circuitry linking catabolite repression and Csr regulatory systems ( 29) also suggests the involvement of CsrA in the transition, since the switch to gluconeogenic substrate consumption requires the alleviation of catabolite repression.

Since the csrA51 mutant strain is reported to overaccumulate glycogen ( 14, 16, 22 ), we assessed the concentration of this storage polysaccharide in the cell during the glucose - acetate transition ( Fig. 1D ).

As expected ( 22 ), the csrA51 mutant strain accumulated up to 0. 28 g of glucose ( ggluc) ⋅ gDW of glycogen − 1, representing about 30% of the biomass dry weight.

The glycogen content in the four strains remained mostly stable during the exponential phase of growth on glucose ( concentrations and rates remained constant ), and all four strains used glycogen after glucose exhaustion.

In addition to its effect on growth rates and glycogen accumulation, the Csr system is involved in the dynamics of the glycolysis - gluconeogenesis transition, notably through its impact on acetate consumption after glucose exhaustion.	"Csr	73	76	Gene/Protein"	"glucose	216	223	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Csr"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 216, ""end_span"": 223, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
CCM gene expression is differently influenced by the Csr system before and after glucose exhaustion.

During the glucose consumption phase, massive differences in gene expression were observed between the mutant strains and the WT, especially the csrA51 mutant strain ( as previously described by Morin et al.

We thus conclude that the Csr system controls different sets of genes before and after glucose exhaustion, the later set being devoted to the use of the remaining carbon sources ( acetate and glycogen ).

Before glucose exhaustion, the ΔcsrBC mutant strain had higher concentrations of fructose 1, 6 - bisphosphate ( FBP) and malate, whereas the ΔcsrD pools were mostly comparable to those of the WT ( Fig. 3A ).

We therefore investigated the energy status of the cells by calculating the adenylate energy charge ( AEC) as an index of the bacterium metabolic state ( 35 ).

The AEC on glucose was between 0. 87 and 0. 91 in all of the strains during the glucose consumption phase ( Fig. 3B ).

In conclusion, the csrA51 mutant strain maintained high energy levels after glucose exhaustion, whereas there was a dramatic drop in the energy status of the ΔcsrBC mutant strain.

At 2. 5 h after glucose exhaustion, the WT and ΔcsrBC mutant strains produced ATP from acetate in the absence of glycogen ( the ATP fluxes produced ranged between 5 and 12 mmol ⋅ gDW − 1 ⋅ h − 1 ), while in the csrA51 mutant strain, ATP was produced from glycogen in the absence of acetate.

The four strains, the WT ( gray circles ), the csrBC mutant ( green squares ), the csrD mutant ( orange triangles ), and the csrA51 mutant ( red diamonds ), were assessed at two different times 90 min (*) and 150 min (**).	"csrD	83	87	Gene/Protein"	"csrA51	125	131	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""csrD"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""csrA51"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Suppression of glycogen synthesis hinders the capacity of the csrA51 mutant strain to maintain high energy levels after glucose exhaustion.	"csrA51	62	68	Gene/Protein"	"glucose	120	127	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""csrA51"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We therefore hypothesized that the impact of Csr on the energy status can only be mediated by the impact of CsrA on glycogen accumulation.	"Csr	45	48	Gene/Protein"	"CsrA	108	112	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Csr"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""CsrA"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
To confirm this hypothesis, we prevented glycogen synthesis in the WT and csrA51 mutant strains by deleting the glgC gene.	"csrA51	74	80	Gene/Protein"	"glgC	112	116	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""csrA51"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""glgC"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
After glucose exhaustion, the AEC of the two strains unable to store glycogen dropped drastically in comparison to that of the WT and csrA51 mutant strains.	"glucose	6	13	Chemical/Drug"	"csrA51	134	140	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""csrA51"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
We therefore conclude that the maintenance of the energy status after glucose exhaustion in the csrA51 mutant strain results from its high glycogen content.	"glucose	70	77	Chemical/Drug"	"csrA51	96	102	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""csrA51"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Concentrations of key central carbon metabolites throughout the glucose - acetate transition of Csr system and / or glycogen - deficient mutants.

( B) The AECs of the same four strains during glucose consumption ( plain bars) and 90 min after glucose exhaustion ( striped bars) are shown.	"glucose	46	53	Chemical/Drug"	"glucose	97	104	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The capacity of Csr and / or glycogen mutant cells to resume growth on fresh acetate minimum medium was assessed before and after glucose exhaustion.	"Csr	16	19	Gene/Protein"	"glucose	130	137	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Csr"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
This delay was reduced to 21 min when the cells were sampled 1 h after glucose exhaustion, likely because of the induced expression of gluconeogenic enzymes.	"glucose	71	78	Chemical/Drug"	"gluconeogenic enzymes	135	156	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""gluconeogenic enzymes"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In the csrA51 mutant strain, the delays increased by 40 to 50% but the same relative decrease was observed after glucose exhaustion.	"csrA51	7	13	Gene/Protein"	"glucose	113	120	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""csrA51"", ""start_span"": 7, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The increase in the delays in the csrA51 mutant strain switched to acetate was also suppressed in the csrA51 ΔglgC mutant strain.	"csrA51	34	40	Gene/Protein"	"csrA51	102	108	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""csrA51"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""csrA51"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Since the glycogen level in the csrBC mutant strain was zero after glucose exhaustion ( Fig. 1D ), we conclude that glycogen is necessary to start acetate uptake 1 h after glucose exhaustion.	"glucose	67	74	Chemical/Drug"	"glucose	172	179	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 172, ""end_span"": 179, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Therefore, the Csr system affects the establishment of metabolic adaptation after glucose exhaustion through its control of glycogen synthesis.	"Csr	15	18	Gene/Protein"	"glucose	82	89	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Csr"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The control by CsrA could also be counterbalanced by its higher sequestration by CsrB, since the latter level has been reported to increase during the transition ( 23, 37 ).	"CsrA	15	19	Gene/Protein"	"CsrB	81	85	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CsrA"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""CsrB"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Most importantly, CsrA was demonstrated to control the expression of genes encoding functions in acetate and glycogen metabolism after glucose exhaustion.	"CsrA	18	22	Gene/Protein"	"glucose	135	142	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""CsrA"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
This gene expression profiling, combined with acetate measurements and switch experiments, demonstrated that CsrA influences the timing of acetate and glycogen utilization after glucose exhaustion.	"CsrA	109	113	Gene/Protein"	"glucose	178	185	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""CsrA"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 178, ""end_span"": 185, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Indeed, a csrA51 mutant strain induced cAMP production after glucose exhaustion, but the levels were about five times lower than in the WT ( Fig. 5A ).	"csrA51	10	16	Gene/Protein"	"glucose	61	68	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""csrA51"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
However, the csrA51 ΔglgC mutant strain presents the same phenotype, proving that this lower cAMP level does not result from the greater glycogen content and is therefore directly linked to CsrA activity.	"csrA51	13	19	Gene/Protein"	"CsrA	190	194	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""csrA51"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""CsrA"", ""start_span"": 190, ""end_span"": 194, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
This phenotype is very likely explained by the fact that glycolysis is still supplied in G6P by glycogen after glucose exhaustion in the csrA51 mutant and this could impair / prevent the establishment of gluconeogenic metabolism.	"glucose	111	118	Chemical/Drug"	"csrA51	137	143	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""csrA51"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
To conclude, this work is of particular importance in understanding ( i) the function of CsrA - mediated posttranscriptional control, ( ii) the role of glycogen in bacteria, and ( iii) the mechanisms behind metabolic adaptation and fitness.

The first antimicrobial marine biosurfactant was reported from Bacillus circulans isolated from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India, which exhibited antimicrobial potential against several multidrug resistant human pathogens with non - hemolytic property ( Das et al. 2008 ).

Hence, the present study was undertaken with regard to the isolation of potential biosurfactant strains using multiple screening methods, followed by the production and purification of the biosurfactant from a promising strain of Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and its biochemical characterization, pH and temperature stability studies and evaluation of the antimicrobial potential of the biosurfactant against different human pathogenic clinical isolates.

To the best of our knowledge, Staphylococcus saprophyticus was unexplored for the production and characterization of biosurfactant, hence further studies were undertaken to this regard.

In support to the current prediction, prior studies have reported that microbial strains from the same species isolated from different ecological niches produce different types of biosurfactant, for example, Serratia marcescens isolated from terrestrial habitats produced Serrawettin, an exolipid biosurfactant ( Li et al. 2005 ); however, Dusane et al.

Further, in the present investigation, the isolated biosurfactant from the marine bacterium S. saprophyticus revealed an interesting observation in its biochemical diversity, producing a glycolipid biosurfactant which was unique as compared to an earlier report of Staphylococcus sp. strain 1E isolated from terrestrial hydrocarbon contaminated soil of Algeria which produced a lipopeptide biosurfactant ( Eddouaouda et al. 2012 ).

This may reflect different approaches to internalizing and externalizing of behaviours, whereby there is a tendency for men to externalize traumatic behaviours, while women internalize following traumatic experiences [ 28 ].	"men	120	123	Organism/Species"	"women	167	172	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""men"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""women"", ""start_span"": 167, ""end_span"": 172, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Furthermore, approximately two - thirds of women and men experienced two or more types of trauma, highlighting the close overlap between different trauma types and that there is likely to be a cumulative impact.

Despite the huge challenges for people living in informal settlements such as poverty, gender inequalities, and lack of access to services, which independently shape HIV - risk behaviours, this study highlights that childhood traumas remained a salient driver of HIV - risk behaviours amongst young people.

For both HZ and PHN, pain severity is a significant predictor of impact on individuals, healthcare systems and society.

A tendency to focus upon healthcare resource use and the direct costs of management at the expense of other impacts ( e. g. informal caregivers and formal social care) may result in an underestimation of the true burden of HZ and PHN.	"HZ	223	225	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	230	233	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 223, ""end_span"": 225, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 230, ""end_span"": 233, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The great majority ( 95 %) [ 2] of the population hosts VZV and approximately one in four persons will develop HZ in their lifetime through reactivation, leading to an estimated 1. 7 million episodes in Europe annually [ 3 ].	"VZV	56	59	Organism/Species"	"HZ	111	113	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""VZV"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
As expected given the relationship to HZ, the incidence of PHN increases markedly with age [ 16 - 18 ].	"HZ	38	40	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	59	62	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
As conditions primarily affecting older persons, many patients with HZ and PHN may already experience significant deficits in health status.

Findings from a number of articles indicate that the pain and resulting discomfort associated with HZ and PHN can have a substantial negative and widespread impact on patients ’ health - related quality of life ( HRQoL) and patients ’ ability to engage in activities of daily living [ 7, 20 - 25 ].	"HZ	99	101	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	106	109	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
For example, considerable costs to healthcare systems [ 26 - 31] arise from the care provision for HZ and PHN patients, including visits to primary care ( general practitioner) and outpatient secondary / tertiary care ( specialist pain clinics and ophthalmologists ), inpatient visits ( hospitalisations) and prescription costs.	"HZ	99	101	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	106	109	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Furthermore, HZ and PHN are also associated with significant indirect costs, primarily in terms of loss of productivity for younger patients [ 7, 21, 23, 24, 28, 32 ].	"HZ	13	15	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	20	23	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Finally, as conditions occurring in retired and older patients, HZ and PHN can also have significant consequences for the caregivers of patients including partners, relatives, and friends of people with the conditions [ 7 ].

In order to understand the value of preventative strategies, a complete understanding of the impact of HZ and PHN is required.	"HZ	103	105	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	110	113	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
While a significant body of literature has sought to determine the impact of HZ and PHN on patients, healthcare systems and wider society within EU countries, to date, no comprehensive review of these studies has been conducted.	"HZ	77	79	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	84	87	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The aim of this review, therefore, is to provide a comprehensive and holistic overview of the humanistic, economic and societal burden of HZ and PHN in Europe as reported within the published peer - reviewed literature.	"HZ	138	140	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	145	148	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
A range of disease - related, economic, societal and HRQoL - related keywords was utilized to capture the humanistic, economic and societal burden of HZ and PHN ( see Table 1 ).	"HZ	150	152	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	157	160	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 160, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Of importance was information related to the study aims, design and outcomes of interest, sample characteristics, country of study, resource use data, cost data ( direct and indirect) and any patient - reported impacts of HZ and PHN.	"HZ	222	224	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	229	232	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 222, ""end_span"": 224, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 229, ""end_span"": 232, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Of the included references, 39 reported data specifically attributed to HZ patients and 35 reported data specifically attributed to PHN patients.	"HZ	72	74	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	132	135	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Data attributed to a combined HZ and PHN population was included in 15 references.	"HZ	30	32	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	37	40	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Data presented in reviewed references was categorized as follows: 1) Healthcare utilisation in terms of rates of medical visits, hospitalisations and medication prescribed, 2) Direct costs corresponding to the management of HZ / PHN, 3) Indirect costs, 4) Total costs and 5) Health related quality of life and humanistic burden.	"HZ	224	226	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	229	232	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 224, ""end_span"": 226, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 229, ""end_span"": 232, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
More frequent specialist visits have also been reported among patients with HZO compared to those with HZ [ 21 ].	"HZO	76	79	Disease/Disorder"	"HZ	103	105	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZO"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The rates of hospitalisations due to HZ and / or PHN reported in the literature ( generally derived from national or insurance databases of hospital admissions) suggest that increased rates of hospitalisation are also associated with increasing age [ 55, 71 ].	"HZ	37	39	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	49	52	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
More frequent hospitalisations have also been observed among patients with PHN when compared to patients with HZ across studies in Italy [ 29 ], Belgium [ 40 ], France [ 55 ], Germany [ 73 ], Spain [ 37, 45, 49, 51, 52, 61 ]. and Portugal [ 59 ].	"PHN	75	78	Disease/Disorder"	"HZ	110	112	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
There are also reports of a greater rate of hospitalisations among female HZ patients compared to male HZ patients at across all age groups [ 71 ].	"HZ	74	76	Disease/Disorder"	"HZ	103	105	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The average length of inpatient stay for PHN ( 10. 2 ± 8. 6 days) has been reported to be higher than those associated with HZ ( 7. 8 ± 5. 4 days) [ 29 ].	"PHN	41	44	Disease/Disorder"	"HZ	124	126	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
For example, analysis of Hospital Episode Statistics ( 2002 – 2005) from England indicates the average length of stay among HZ / PHN patients aged 60 – 64 is 9. 3 days whereas those aged 85 – 90 is 22. 3 days [ 74 ].	"HZ	124	126	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	129	132	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
It is reported that up to 100% of PHN patients and 83. 2% of patients with HZ receive medication for their condition across all ages [ 31 ].	"PHN	34	37	Disease/Disorder"	"HZ	75	77	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The types of medication used has been reported to vary depending on the population being considered ( HZ or PHN) [ 14, 21, 29, 50 ].	"HZ	102	104	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	108	111	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Indeed, current treatment of HZ aims to relieve pain, to limit the spread and duration of the dermatomal lesions and ( when started within 72 hours of rash onset) to prevent or alleviate complications associated with HZ.	"HZ	29	31	Disease/Disorder"	"HZ	217	219	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 217, ""end_span"": 219, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The amount of available information regarding medication use in EU countries was somewhat limited; however available evidence from the literature suggests that, despite the availability of European Guidelines for the management of HZ [ 80, 81 ], medication prescribing practices ( for the treatment of PHN in particular) are not consistent across countries [ 14, 21, 25, 29, 44, 50 ].	"HZ	231	233	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	302	305	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 231, ""end_span"": 233, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 302, ""end_span"": 305, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
An observational study of PHN patients over the age of 50 conducted in France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain and the UK ( n = 84 ), for example, reported that neuropathic pain medications ( 89 %), analgesics ( 64 %) and anticonvulsants ( 52 %) were most commonly prescribed for the treatment of PHN [ 25 ].	"PHN	26	29	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	300	303	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 300, ""end_span"": 303, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Of note, despite the widespread use of pharmacological therapies for the management of HZ and PHN, reports from patients indicate dissatisfaction with treatments, particularly in regards to perceived efficacy [ 14, 50 ].	"HZ	87	89	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	94	97	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Details of additional investigations among patients with HZ and PHN were reported from studies in France, Italy, Spain and the UK [ 14, 21, 27, 29, 50 ].	"HZ	57	59	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	64	67	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
By comparison, rates of additional investigations reported in France, Spain and the UK were lower [ 14, 21, 27, 50 ], with evidence suggesting that rates of additional investigations were higher in those with PHN ( 10 – 12. 5% compared to HZ ( 4. 4 - 9 %) [ 14, 21, 50 ].	"PHN	209	212	Disease/Disorder"	"HZ	239	241	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 209, ""end_span"": 212, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 239, ""end_span"": 241, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Additional investigations are also more likely among those patients with HZO compared to HZ [ 21 ].	"HZO	73	76	Disease/Disorder"	"HZ	89	91	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZO"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Direct costs of the management of HZ and PHN patients were reported in 20 studies.	"HZ	34	36	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	41	44	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Outpatient costs ( including medical visits, diagnostic tests and medications ), hospitalization and inpatient costs were identified in the literature as key contributors to the overall cost burden of HZ and PHN.	"HZ	201	203	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	208	211	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 201, ""end_span"": 203, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 208, ""end_span"": 211, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
For example, mean direct costs of outpatient management have been reported as € 107. 98 per HZ episode and € 406. 04 and € 485. 51 per PHN episode ( 1 - and 3 - month definition respectively) [ 28] a.	"HZ	92	94	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	135	138	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In addition, costs for outpatient management of HZ and PHN have been reported to increase markedly with pain severity [ 26, 28 ].	"HZ	48	50	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	55	58	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
These differences were highlighted by one study which investigated the annual cost of HZ and PHN to healthcare providers located in England and Wales [ 47 ].	"HZ	86	88	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	93	96	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Similar findings are reported in Germany where statutory health insurance bills have been estimated at € 115. 5 m; € 93. 5 m attributed to HZ treatment and € 22 m attributed to treatment of PHN [ 31 ].	"HZ	139	141	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	190	193	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 190, ""end_span"": 193, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Hospitalisation costs contribute significantly to the overall direct cost of managing HZ and PHN.	"HZ	86	88	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	93	96	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Seventeen articles reported data on sick leave due to HZ and PHN and the costs that this incurs [ 7, 26, 27, 29 - 31, 40, 42, 58, 60, 63, 69, 70, 72, 73, 77, 82 ].	"HZ	54	56	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	61	64	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In France, these costs accounted for up to 30% of the costs of management of HZ from the societal perspective and up to 10% of the costs of management for PHN in patients aged 50 years and over [ 30 ].	"HZ	77	79	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	155	158	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Average costs for patients over the age of 50 in Italy were € 684 per case of HZ and € 978 per case of PHN [ 29 ].	"HZ	78	80	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	103	106	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
A total of 10 studies reported the total cost per case of HZ and / or PHN in EU countries, taking into account both direct costs ( including medical visits, medications and hospitalisations) and indirect costs ( including time missed from work ).	"HZ	58	60	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	70	73	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
The total annual cost ( direct and indirect costs) of HZ and PHN on a country level basis was only available for the UK [ 43 ], France [ 30 ], Germany [ 31 ], Italy [ 29] and Sweden [ 63 ].	"HZ	54	56	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	61	64	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Two studies presented data separately for the cost of HZ and PHN and patients over the age of 50 [ 29, 31 ].	"HZ	54	56	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	61	64	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Further details are provided in Figure 2. Figure 2 Estimated total cost burden associated with HZ and PHN considering outpatient, hospitalisation and indirect costs.

Patients also reported consequences for their family and social circle when suffering from HZ or PHN [ 58, 77, 84 ].	"HZ	91	93	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	97	100	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Reports within the reviewed literature indicate that patients with HZ and PHN experience moderate - severe pain.	"HZ	67	69	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	74	77	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Ratings of average and worst pain reported in the literature are higher among PHN patients compared to HZ patients [ 14, 41, 50, 58, 77 ].	"PHN	78	81	Disease/Disorder"	"HZ	103	105	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Table 6 presents the mean scores for patients with HZ and PHN from five studies.

In general, reports of pain interference on all seven health status domains were greater among patients experiencing PHN compared to patients with HZ [ 14, 50, 58, 77 ].	"PHN	117	120	Disease/Disorder"	"HZ	147	149	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
While differences in the level of interference observed varied from country to country, the domains of health status most affected was largely consistent.

A number of studies have included generic HRQoL measures such as the SF - 12 [ 15, 83 ], SF - 36 [ 14, 21, 50 ], EQ - 5D [ 7, 14, 25, 50] and Short Italian Questionnaire ( SIQ) [ 75, 76] to assess HRQoL in HZ and PHN patients.

As a condition mainly inflicting the elderly, therefore, HRQoL is already considerably compromised in HZ and PHN patients.

Firstly, the direct costs of managing HZ represent a significant proportion of the total costs associated with the disease, with higher costs associated with the presence of PHN and with greater pain severity.	"HZ	38	40	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	174	177	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 174, ""end_span"": 177, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
This demographic shift is likely to have a profound influence on the incidence of HZ and PHN and may contribute to increased concern among European healthcare authorities; particularly if economic crisis and healthcare budget constrains persist in the long term.	"HZ	82	84	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	89	92	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Findings from this review indicate that the direct costs of HZ and PHN management are greater for older patients.	"HZ	60	62	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	67	70	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In addition, older adults typically have lower HRQoL than younger adults ( deficits which are more pronounced with the presence of HZ and PHN) and may be less able to complete activities of daily living and self - care unassisted.	"HZ	131	133	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	138	141	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
There is currently no consensus regarding the definition of PHN and a lack of consistency in the definition of PHN employed in studies was evident throughout the review.	"PHN	60	63	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	111	114	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
This presents a number of challenges when attempting to accurately understand the burden of HZ and PHN.	"HZ	92	94	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	99	102	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Accurately attributing costs to HZ and PHN and determining the overall cost burden of the conditions, therefore, is difficult.	"HZ	32	34	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	39	42	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
As a result, there may be a significant proportion of PHN patients who have not been considered in these studies; consequently decreasing confidence in the accuracy of estimates regarding the burden of PHN.	"PHN	54	57	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	202	205	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 202, ""end_span"": 205, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Currently these differences are not reflected in the published literature and in some cases, the cost of treating a case of HZ or PHN were calculated inconsistently, with some studies presenting the cost per treated case while others presented the average across all patients.	"HZ	124	126	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	130	133	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Only one study provided costs ( per treated case) for the different types of medications used to treat HZ or PHN [ 46 ].	"HZ	103	105	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	109	112	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Furthermore this highlights an unmet need for data that clearly distinguishes between HZ and PHN and also for ‘ per treated case ’ data for a wide range of EU countries.	"HZ	86	88	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	93	96	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
A number of studies assessing aspects of humanistic burden associated with HZ and PHN were identified.	"HZ	75	77	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	82	85	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Firstly, the impact of HZ and PHN was generally assessed using disease specific questionnaires ( such as the ZBPI) or ‘ bespoke ’ questions which have not been tested or validated.	"HZ	23	25	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	30	33	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
However, data from such instruments are valuable for quantifying burden with reference to the normative population and patients with other diseases – data that is important for contextualizing the relative burden associated with HZ and PHN.	"HZ	229	231	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	236	239	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 229, ""end_span"": 231, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 236, ""end_span"": 239, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
For example, the functional deficits observed among HZ and PHN patients that may lead to a loss of autonomy and increased reliance on formal paid care have not been estimated.	"HZ	52	54	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	59	62	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Beyond some evidence of direct and indirect costs related to the disease, the potential impact of HZ and PHN on the social care system remains unknown.	"HZ	98	100	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	105	108	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
This literature review highlights the burden faced by patients, healthcare systems and society due to HZ and PHN in Europe.

No study fully addressed the humanistic and economic burden of HZ and PHN to patients, their families and society as a whole.	"HZ	63	65	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	70	73	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Based on the reviewed evidence and an assessment of the gaps in the evidence base, it is likely that the true burden of HZ and PHN is underestimated in the Europe.

Although several RBSDV proteins have been studied in detail, the functions of the nonstructural protein P7 - 1 are still largely unknown.

Flowers and pollen from P7 - 1 - transgenic plants were of normal size and shape, and anthers developed to the normal size but failed to dehisce.

These results indicate that ectopic expression of the RBSDV P7 - 1 protein in A. thaliana causes male sterility, possibly through the disruption of the lignin biosynthesis and H2O2 - dependent polymerization pathways.

P7 - 1 - OE anthers produced low levels of H2O2 ( Figure 6B, DAB staining) but equivalent amounts of O2 − ( Figure S5, NBT staining) compared with wild - type plants.

These results show that the accumulation of ROS in anthers prior to dehiscence is nearly absent when RBSDV P7 - 1 is ectopically expressed.

In this study, our results suggest that RBSDV P7 - 1 is a novel determinant of disease symptom development.

First, RBSDV infection caused alterations in anther development in rice plants, resulting in partial sterility due to non - dehiscent anthers ( Figure 1 ).

The non - dehiscent anther phenotype of P7 - 1 transgenic plants was correlated with reduced secondary wall lignification in the endothecium and decreased ROS levels in the anthers ( Figure 5 and 6 ).	"P7 - 1	40	46	Gene/Protein"	"plants	58	64	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""P7 - 1"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""plants"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In this study, we determined that the male sterility of P7 - 1 - OE transgenic plants was due to the failure of anther dehiscence and pollen release, which may have been caused by the lack of lignification in the anther endothecium ( Figure 4 and 5 ).

Thus, the reduced lignification of anthers is responsible for male sterility in P7 - 1 - OE transgenic plants.

Of the investigated genomic blocks, we find that 22% return the modern LC line and Caucasian wisent as monophyletic ( fig. 6 ), and may therefore represent introgressed segments of Caucasian wisent ancestry in this modern LC line individual.

For example, chromosome 27 almost entirely lacks Caucasian wisent ancestry whereas around 50% of chromosomes 4 and 15 are likely derived from admixture.

Colored blocks indicate 1 Mb genomic blocks returning alternative tree topologies, blue blocks are compatible with the species tree; yellow blocks return the monophly of the modern LC line and Caucasian wisent, and likely result from admixture and to a lesser extent incomplete lineage sorting; red blocks return the monophyly of PLATEN and Caucasian wisent and likely result from incomplete lineage sorting. “ X ” shows blocks with missing data.

Thus, modern L line individuals appear more admixed with Caucasian wisent than the two founding wisent investigated here.

Pedigree information provides an approximate date for geneflow from Caucasian wisent into the modern LC line around 90 years ago ( 15 – 22 generations ), the result of which are many intact multi - megabase genomic blocks derived from Caucasian wisent in the modern LC line individual ( fig. 6 ).

This rejects recent admixture and instead supports variable admixture proportions among the founding herd in explaining the observed signal of Caucasian wisent admixture in this modern L line individual.

Genomic blocks in the LC line wisent ( red) result from admixture occurring around 90 years ago; the lower abundance of larger admixed blocks in the modern L line wisent support that this admixture event preceded the former.

We also compared derived allele sharing with cattle among the individual wisent.

Specifically, PLANTA shares more derived alleles with domestic cattle than either Caucasian wisent or PLATEN do.	"domestic cattle	54	69	Organism/Species"	"Caucasian wisent	82	98	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""domestic cattle"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Caucasian wisent"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We find evidence of at least two highly differentiated populations within Caucasian wisent, with one of these showing greater pairwise similarities with Lowland wisent than with the second Caucasian population, at the level of the complete genome ( fig. 2 ).	"Caucasian wisent	74	90	Organism/Species"	"Lowland wisent	153	167	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Caucasian wisent"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Lowland wisent"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 167, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Thus, among any two Caucasian wisent and any two modern ( or founding Lowland) wisent, we may expect that any single locus has only around 50% probability of reflecting the true history of population divergence.	"Caucasian wisent	20	36	Organism/Species"	"wisent	79	85	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Caucasian wisent"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Our results also demonstrate that the notion of wisent subspecies purity is flawed in the sense that founding Lowland individuals were in fact admixed with Caucasian wisent to varying degrees.	"wisent	48	54	Organism/Species"	"Caucasian wisent	156	172	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Caucasian wisent"", ""start_span"": 156, ""end_span"": 172, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We demonstrate this, both directly for the founder PLANTA in comparison to another founder, her son PLATEN, and also indirectly, by the elevated signal of Caucasian wisent admixture in modern L line wisent, relative to these founders, most likely a result of inheritance from other founding individuals not included in this analysis ( fig. 7 ).	"Caucasian wisent	155	171	Organism/Species"	"wisent	199	205	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Caucasian wisent"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 171, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 199, ""end_span"": 205, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The notion of subspecies purity therefore disregards the fact that admixture between Caucasian and Lowland wisent almost certainly occurred prior to the extinction of wisent in the wild, and such admixture could therefore be regarded as part of the normal population processes and dynamics of this species.	"Lowland wisent	99	113	Organism/Species"	"wisent	167	173	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Lowland wisent"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 167, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Some individuals were found to possess a microsatellite allele that was common among Caucasian wisent but absent in all studied Lowland wisent, which these authors interpreted as evidence of recent admixture with the modern LC line.	"Caucasian wisent	85	101	Organism/Species"	"Lowland wisent	128	142	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Caucasian wisent"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Lowland wisent"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In apparent contrast to these results, whole - genome heterozygosity in modern wisent has been shown to be similar to that found within domestic cow breeds ( Gautier et al.	"wisent	79	85	Organism/Species"	"domestic cow	136	148	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""domestic cow"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
However, the bimodal distributions observed for pairwise comparisons based on transitions and transversions for modern wisent suggests that, among any pair of modern wisent, large chromosomal blocks will show high genetic similarity, which is indicative of inbreeding, and has been shown previously using SNP array data ( Pertoldi et al.	"wisent	119	125	Organism/Species"	"wisent	166	172	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 166, ""end_span"": 172, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Our study demonstrates that, at least in principle, by generating chromosomal admixture maps for multiple living representatives of the LC line, it would be possible to selectively breed an animal that is, at the genomic level, highly similar to a Caucasian wisent.	"animal	190	196	Organism/Species"	"Caucasian wisent	248	264	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""animal"", ""start_span"": 190, ""end_span"": 196, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Caucasian wisent"", ""start_span"": 248, ""end_span"": 264, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

We extend this result by demonstrating that such admixture is widespread across wisent, including both modern genetic lines, representatives of the original founding herd, and also extinct Caucasian wisent.	"wisent	80	86	Organism/Species"	"Caucasian wisent	189	205	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Caucasian wisent"", ""start_span"": 189, ""end_span"": 205, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This admixture post - dates the common ancestor of English aurochs and taurine cattle, and involved a representative of the latter lineage.

Testing these two alternatives would require data from additional aurochs populations from within the core distribution of wisent, and would be a valuable direction for future research.

Instead, admixture must have occurred prior to the establishment of the captive breeding program, and the admixture signal detected in modern wisent results from inheritance from the founders that were admixed with cattle to varying degrees.

Of note, these three markers showed the strongest inverse associations with CD4 + T cell counts among the 7 markers we examined, suggesting a link between T cell homeostasis and HIV persistence ( S4A, S4B and S4C Fig ).	"CD4	76	79	Gene/Protein"	"HIV	178	181	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 178, ""end_span"": 181, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The associations between individual IC expression and HIV persistence marker were substantially smaller and no longer statistically significant after adjusting for current CD4 + T - cell count.

These findings from the negative binomial regression models suggest that the current CD4 + T - cell count is an important predictor of the size of the HIV reservoir when measured as the frequency of cells harboring proviral genomes [ 6, 37 ].	"CD4	85	88	Gene/Protein"	"HIV	151	154	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 151, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Further investigations will be needed to characterize the mechanisms by which these ICs may specifically contribute to HIV persistence within these distinct subsets.

Overall, the majority of inducible HIV genomes were found in memory CD4 + T cells expressing at least one of these markers ( median of 76 %).	"HIV	35	38	Organism/Species"	"CD4	68	71	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Although triple negative cells also contain inducible HIV genomes, our data provide evidence that there is an enrichment for inducible viral genomes in CD4 + T cells expressing these markers.	"HIV	54	57	Organism/Species"	"CD4	152	155	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 152, ""end_span"": 155, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Importantly, we found a gradual enrichment in integrated HIV DNA in cells that express multiple ICs simultaneously.

All together, these studies indicate that ICs can synergize to repress T cell functions and suggest that these synergies may also play a role in HIV persistence during ART.	"ICs	42	45	Gene/Protein"	"HIV	145	148	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""ICs"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
It is possible that CD4 + T cells expressing these markers before ART represent a preferential niche for the establishment of a stable reservoir for HIV and that latently infected cells expressing these markers preferentially persist during ART, as suggested by our observations.	"CD4	20	23	Gene/Protein"	"HIV	149	152	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 149, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

We chose this readout as it was applicable to small subsets of CD4 + T cells on which measures of replication competent HIV cannot be performed.

The majority of viral genomes persisting during ART are known to be defective [ 40, 54 ], and although our experiments indicate that cells that express ICs can produce multiply spliced RNA upon activation ( TILDA ), they do not demonstrate that replication competent virus persists in these cells.

It is possible and indeed likely that the biology of ICs expression and HIV persistence will differ in tissues, particularly in secondary lymphoid tissues where many of the ligands for these receptors are likely to be expressed.

Most vertebrate species contain 10 different DGK isozymes, which are grouped into 5 different classes based on the presence or absence of specific functional domains.

Further, our analysis of the sequence alignments of catalytic domains has identified > 10 novel sequence signatures consisting of conserved signature indels ( inserts or deletions, CSIs) that are distinctive characteristics of either particular classes of DGK isozymes, or are commonly shared by members of two or more classes of DGK isozymes.

Diacylglycerol ( DAG) and phosphatidic acid ( PA) are two main signalling molecules within eukaryotic cells which, through their interactions with different effector proteins, play central roles in regulating diverse cellular processes [ 1 – 6 ].

The DAG produced serves as a substrate for the enzyme DAG kinase ( DGK ), which phosphorylates it into PA.

Due to the ability of DGK to convert one important signalling molecule ( DAG) into another ( PA ), the activity of DGK in different cells is tightly controlled for maintenance of normal physiological conditions [ 1 – 6 ].

Because DGK plays an important role in controlling diverse cellular processes including development, cell division and proliferation, neuronal and immune responses, vascular traffic, apoptosis, cytoskeletal reorganization, etc. multiples forms of DGK are generally found in most eukaryotic organisms [ 1 – 10 ].

In mammalian species, where the DGK family of proteins has been best studied, 10 different isozymes of DGK, designated as α, β, γ, δ, ε, ζ, η, θ, ι and κ, differing in their biochemical properties, tissue distributions, as well as their lengths ( ranging from 567 aa to > 1150 aa) have been identified [ 1 – 6, 11 ].

There is also limited understanding of the distributions of DGK isozymes in eukaryotic organisms other than mammals [ 3, 10, 14 – 16 ].

Additionally, and more importantly, our analysis of the sequence alignment of the catalytic domain has identified large numbers of novel sequence signatures in the forms of conserved inserts and deletions ( indels) that are distinctive of either particular classes of DGK isozymes, or are commonly shared by members of two or more classes of DGK isozymes.

These results point to the existence of important differences in the function of catalytic domain for different classes of DGK isozymes and are also useful in understanding the evolutionary relationships among the DGK family of proteins.

The resulting sequences for the DGK CDs were then realigned and, based on these alignments, a segment of 364 aa was identified that showed good conservation amongst different DGK classes.

Based on significant hits observed in these Blast searches, and to which DGK isozymes the observed hits exhibited maximal similarity, tentative inferences regarding the presence or absence of specific DGK isozymes in deeper branching eukaryotic taxa were made.

Within each DGK class, homologs belonging to different DGK isozymes also generally formed separate clusters, except for the homologs of kappa and zeta isozymes which exhibited polyphyletic branching and were separated into two clusters.

In the tree shown in Fig 2, while the distinction between different DGK classes was strongly supported, the nodes connecting these classes had low bootstrap scores indicating that the evolutionary relationships among different DGK classes were not reliably resolved.

We have examined the sequence alignment of catalytic domains from DGK homologs for the presence of CSIs and these analyses have identified a number of useful CSIs that are specifically shared by particular groups of DGK isozymes.

The observed CSI is present in a conserved region near the C - terminal end of the catalytic domain and its shared presence by all DGK - α, - β and - γ homologs provides further evidence of the close and specific relationship among these isozymes belonging to class I DGKs.

In addition to the CSI shown in Fig 3, DGK homologs contain one additional 2 aa conserved insert ( marked Sig ❷A in Fig 4 ), which is also commonly shared by the class I DGK homologs.

In the same position, where this 2 aa CSI is found in class I homologs, a 4 aa insert ( marked as Sig ❷B) is present in the DGK - ί and DGK - ζ homologs ( class IV isozymes ).

The Class I DGK homologs contain two different CSIs ( a 5 aa deletion and a 2 aa deletion, denoted as Sig ❻) in this region whereas the DGK - ε homologs ( class III) all have an 8 aa deletion in this position ( marked as Sig ❽ ).

In addition, the DGK - θ and DGK - ί isozymes can also be distinguished from others by the presence of 1 aa CSIs ( deletions) that appear specific for these isoforms.

However, it is unclear whether all of the different DGK isozymes are present in different vertebrate classes and other deeper branching eukaryotic phyla.	"DGK	52	55	Gene/Protein"	"vertebrate	90	100	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""DGK"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""vertebrate"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Most vertebrate species contain 10 different DGK isozymes which are grouped into 5 different classes or types ( Fig 1 ).	"vertebrate	5	15	Organism/Species"	"DGK	45	48	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""vertebrate"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""DGK"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The DGKs from different classes are distinguished from each other by the presence or absence of specific functional domains; however, all of them share a large catalytic domain ( CD ), as well as two cysteine - rich domains.	"DGKs	4	8	Gene/Protein"	"cysteine	200	208	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""DGKs"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""cysteine"", ""start_span"": 200, ""end_span"": 208, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In contrast, the cysteine - rich C1 domains are of short lengths (~ 50 aa ), show considerable sequence variation, and they are also present in numerous other proteins including the protein kinase C family of proteins [ 2 – 4, 12, 36 ].	"cysteine	17	25	Chemical/Drug"	"protein kinase C	182	198	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cysteine"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""protein kinase C"", ""start_span"": 182, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The observed results indicate strongly that apart from the other known differences in different types of DGK homologs ( see [ 1 – 6 ]) their catalytic domain sequences have also diverged considerably from each other and provide clear distinction among different types of DGK homologs.	"DGK	105	108	Gene/Protein"	"DGK	271	274	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DGK"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""DGK"", ""start_span"": 271, ""end_span"": 274, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In contrast, the DGK isozymes within each DGK class were tightly clustered in the phylogenetic tree indicating that their catalytic domain sequences are very similar.	"DGK	17	20	Gene/Protein"	"DGK	42	45	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DGK"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""DGK"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
A major focus of the present work was on identifying novel sequence features within the CD, which are specific for either a particular type of DGK homologs or which are commonly shared by members of different DGK classes.	"DGK	143	146	Gene/Protein"	"DGK	209	212	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DGK"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""DGK"", ""start_span"": 209, ""end_span"": 212, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Locations of the different CSIs in the CD are indicated using the sequence of the human DGK - ε isoform as reference ( accession number NP_003638 ).

The locations of the CSIs are marked using the catalytic domain sequence for the human DGK - ε isoform ( accession number NP_003638) as reference.	"human	81	86	Organism/Species"	"DGK - ε	87	94	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""DGK - \u03b5"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The described signatures are uniquely present in all members of the indicated classes from vertebrate species ( the main focus of the present work) indicating that the genetic changes responsible for these CSIs first occurred in the ancestors of specific DGK isoforms, and they were then retained in the descendent species.	"vertebrate	91	101	Organism/Species"	"DGK	255	258	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""vertebrate"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""DGK"", ""start_span"": 255, ""end_span"": 258, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Further, according to the definition of the CSI ( s) used in our work, the large insert (> 300 aa) within the class II DGK members [ 2 – 6, 12 ], also represents a CSI ( marked as Sig ❼) specific for the class II DGK homologs.	"class II DGK	110	122	Gene/Protein"	"class II DGK	204	216	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""class II DGK"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""class II DGK"", ""start_span"": 204, ""end_span"": 216, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Based on the differences in the lengths of the CSIs in different classes of DGK homologs, this region is predicted to specify important functional differences in the properties of different classes of DGK homologs.	"DGK	76	79	Gene/Protein"	"DGK	201	204	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DGK"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""DGK"", ""start_span"": 201, ""end_span"": 204, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The CDs from DGK - ε, - ζ, and - θ proteins exhibit very little DGK activity when expressed as isolated subunits [ 2 ].	"DGK - ε	13	20	Gene/Protein"	"DGK	64	67	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DGK - \u03b5"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""DGK"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The CSIs in protein sequences provide another useful means for understanding the evolutionary relationships among distantly related species; however, in the present instance, due to the absence of a suitable outgroup, it was difficult to establish the ancestral state of the DGK protein sequence and reliably infer whether the observed CSIs are insertions or deletions in the indicated classes of DGK homologs.	"DGK	275	278	Gene/Protein"	"DGK	397	400	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DGK"", ""start_span"": 275, ""end_span"": 278, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""DGK"", ""start_span"": 397, ""end_span"": 400, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In addition to their nearly ubiquitous presence in vertebrate species, the homologs for these isoforms are also indicated to be present in most invertebrate species.	"vertebrate	51	61	Organism/Species"	"invertebrate	144	156	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""vertebrate"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""invertebrate"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
In contrast, homologs for the other DGK isozymes were not detected in a number of invertebrate phyla ( Table 1 ).	"DGK	36	39	Gene/Protein"	"invertebrate	82	94	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""DGK"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""invertebrate"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Of these isoforms, DGK - ε represents the most rudimentary form of the protein containing all of the main sequence features that are commonly shared by all other DGK family members.	"DGK - ε	19	26	Gene/Protein"	"DGK	162	165	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DGK - \u03b5"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""DGK"", ""start_span"": 162, ""end_span"": 165, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Thus, it is possible that the DGK - ε originated first, and all other DGK isoforms originated from it by acquisition of different domains and other identified signatures.	"DGK - ε	30	37	Gene/Protein"	"DGK	70	73	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DGK - \u03b5"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""DGK"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
However, the present study is based only on the analyses of the catalytic domain sequences and further work on the analyses of other sequence regions of the DGK protein family could provide additional useful information to clarify the relationships among different DGK isoforms.	"DGK	157	160	Gene/Protein"	"DGK	265	268	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DGK"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 160, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""DGK"", ""start_span"": 265, ""end_span"": 268, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Extracellular matrix ( ECM) components and neurotrophic factors ( NTFs) exert their effect on different neuronal populations creating a suitable environment to promote axonal growth.

ECM components interact with integrin heterodimer receptors that are highly expressed in growth cones and non - neuronal cells, both during development and after injury [ 11, 12 ], promoting axonal guidance, cell adhesion and migration.	"integrin heterodimer receptors	29	59	Gene/Protein"	"injury	162	168	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""integrin heterodimer receptors"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""injury"", ""start_span"": 162, ""end_span"": 168, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Several reports have demonstrated that the pattern of NTFs expressed in denervated Schwann cells after nerve injury is different between motor and sensory nerve branches, and that motor and sensory axons also express different cell adhesion molecules that may promote differential binding to ECM molecules [ 16, 17, 18, 19 ].	"NTFs	54	58	Gene/Protein"	"nerve injury	103	115	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""NTFs"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""nerve injury"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In Vitro Effects of Combining Neurotrophic Factors ( NTFs) and Extracellular Matrix ( ECM) Substrates on Neurite Outgrowth	"Neurotrophic Factors	30	50	Gene/Protein"	"NTFs	53	57	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Neurotrophic Factors"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""NTFs"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Furthermore, the combination of FN + BDNF significantly enhanced maximum neurite length and density of neurites compared to the other single and combined groups.	"FN	32	34	Gene/Protein"	"BDNF	37	41	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FN"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""BDNF"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Thus, while groups with either FN or BDNF present an increase in the amount and length of neurites, the combination of the two factors shows a synergistic effect with significant differences with respect to all the other groups.	"FN	31	33	Gene/Protein"	"BDNF	37	41	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FN"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""BDNF"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

At 60 dpi, the FN + MP. BDNF group showed higher amplitude than all the other groups ( p < 0. 01 ).

FN group also showed significant differences with respect to COL group ( p < 0. 05 ).

In this case, the CMAP amplitude at 75 dpi was significantly higher in FN + MP. BDNF group compared to all the other groups ( p < 0. 001, Figure 4B ).

NTFs and ECM components both have important roles in nerve regeneration after injury, including effects on Schwann cell migration and differentiation, neuronal survival, cell adhesion and axonal growth [ 10, 23 ].	"NTFs	0	4	Gene/Protein"	"injury	78	84	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""NTFs"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""injury"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
On the other hand, BDNF combined with FN promoted a synergic effect on motor neurite outgrowth with small effects on DRG explants, which can be attributed to the effect on regenerating proprioceptive neurites [ 14 ].	"BDNF	19	23	Gene/Protein"	"FN	38	40	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BDNF"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""FN"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The synergistic effect can be exemplified for BDNF, that promotes sensory neurite outgrowth in the presence of LM but not when is added alone.	"BDNF	46	50	Gene/Protein"	"LM	111	113	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BDNF"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""LM"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Actually, NGF contributes to enhance ECM signaling by promoting axonal transport and accumulation of β1 integrin in growth cones, thus enhancing neurite outgrowth [ 39 ].

The NTFs were encapsulated in PLGA microspheres as they have been approved by the FDA as a drug delivery system [ 41] and we have recently demonstrated that they do not interfere with axon regeneration and their slow release over more than 30 days provides more sustained support for nerve regeneration with respect to addition of free NTFs [ 21 ].

This is a positive indication that the design and the concentrations of encapsulated NTFs and ECM components did not cause detrimental effects such as the candy store effect [ 42] or neuronal death induced by high concentration of NTFs [ 43 ].	"NTFs	85	89	Gene/Protein"	"NTFs	231	235	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NTFs"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""NTFs"", ""start_span"": 231, ""end_span"": 235, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
After nerve injury, ECM components are synthesized and secreted by non - neuronal cells such as Schwann cells and fibroblasts [ 44 ], whereas NTFs are expressed by both neuronal and non - neuronal cells [ 16, 45, 46 ].

Moreover, to determine whether M2 - like macrophages treated by cMSCs stimulate the growth of mammary cancer cells in vivo, we injected 4T1 - FLUC cells into the mammary fat pads of mice either alone or coupled with M2 - like macrophages.

In our experiments, when exposed to sufficient levels of pro - inflammatory cytokines in the M1 medium, the MSCs responded to adopting an immune regulatory phenotype to dampen inflammation and promote tumor growth.

While fat - rich AML contained enough fat to be detected on UECT ( ROI ≤ – 10 HU ), fat - poor AML did not.

Finally, AMLs with epithelial cysts could be distinguished by the presence of epithelial cysts, with the non - cystic parts appearing similar to hyperattenuating AML.

The authors reported isoattenuating AML being an AML with attenuation values between – 10 and 45 HU on UECT.

So, because of the wide range of AML attenuation values, “ isoattenuating AML ” does not seem to be an appropriate term.	"AML	33	36	Disease/Disorder"	"AML	74	77	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"

In TSC, hamartomas are formed in multiple organs throughout the body, leading to a variety of symptoms.

LAM, in association with TSC or in the sporadic form, is characterised by cystic changes within the lung parenchyma.

So wherever a ROI is placed in fat - invisible AMLs, their attenuation numbers tend to be higher and fairly constant compared with those of fat - poor AMLs [ 91011 ].

This hyperdense collection may obscure the fat, leading to misdiagnosing a simple AML as a renal cancer [ 2 ].

As the presence of adipose tissue is highly suggestive of AML, the presence of calcification raises the possibility of renal cancer.

However, this T1 - hyperintensity is not a specific characteristic of AML and can also be present in RCC and haemorrhagic cysts.

Currently, percutaneous renal biopsy is recommended only for differentiating fat - invisible AML from RCC, if both CT and MR images are inconclusive.	"AML	93	96	Disease/Disorder"	"RCC	102	105	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""RCC"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
While a fat - invisible AML is homogenously hypointense on T2 - weighted MR images, clear cell RCC appears hyperintense [ 9 ].	"AML	24	27	Disease/Disorder"	"RCC	95	98	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""RCC"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Therefore, percutaneous biopsy is required to differentiate fat - invisible AML and papillary RCC when a small ( less than 3 cm ), T2 - hypointense renal mass without evidence of intratumoural fat is encountered [ 18 ].	"AML	76	79	Disease/Disorder"	"RCC	94	97	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""RCC"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Proceeding directly to a suitable treatment may be a more appropriate option, both to avoid further bleeding and because epithelioid AML and RCC are more presumable [ 3 ].

This shows that the differentiation between AML and RCC remains difficult in routine practice [ 202122 ].

As already repeatedly stated above, classic AML can be distinguished from RCC by the presence of macroscopic fat in sufficient quantity to be detected on UECT.

However, in 4 – 5% of AML cases, no fat can be visualized on CT, increasing the difficulty in differentiating it from RCC.	"AML	22	25	Disease/Disorder"	"RCC	118	121	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""AML"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""RCC"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
However, because these characteristic features are not present in every AML and exceptions do exist, no single finding or modality is perfectly accurate [ 2021222324 ].

All this evidence would suggest that, although tumour diameter is important, the size of related aneurysms and the vascularity of the AML may ultimately be more significant [ 1127 ].
