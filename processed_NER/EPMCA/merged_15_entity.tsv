Four groups of potential moderators were extracted on the basis of the literature reviewed above. 1. Selection criteria used in some previous RCTs: male sex; age; patient does not meet full DSM - IV criteria ( American Psychiatric Association, 1994) and only meets ICD - 10 ( World Health Organization, 2010) PTSD criteria; PTSD is not the main problem ( i. e ., another disorder is so severe that it needs principal concurrent treatment in its own right, e. g ., very severe depression or agoraphobia ); borderline personality disorder; current substance abuse; current PTSD is linked to multiple traumas; history of childhood abuse; no memory for the trauma; patient had a previous course of trauma - focused CBT for PTSD. 2. Demographic variables: ethnic group; education; social problems ( defined as one or more of unemployment, financial hardship, housing problems ); relationship status ( never married / lived with partner vs. married, cohabiting, widowed or divorced ); ongoing legal proceedings, any previous treatment for PTSD. 3. Comorbidity: current comorbid anxiety disorder, mood disorders, other axis 1 disorders, personality disorder, suicidal ideation, taking psychotropic medication; physical disability resulting from trauma, chronic pain; history of major depression, substance dependence, or suicide attempts. 4. Aspects of trauma history: Trauma type ( interpersonal trauma vs other ); trauma involved death of other person; injured in trauma; months since main trauma; history of other traumas; total number of traumas experienced.

The canonical Wnt pathway ( or Wnt / β - catenin pathway) leads to an accumulation of β - catenin in the cytoplasm that can be translocated into the nucleus and activate transcription factors. 3 A recent analysis of human HCC has shown that the Wnt pathway is activated in 49% of HCC and that almost half of these had features consistent with the activation of the Wnt / β - catenin pathway. 6 These data are in line with an integrated analysis of somatic mutations which revealed activating mutations of β - catenin ( CTNNB1) in 33% of human HCC.
