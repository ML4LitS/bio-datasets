Although further adjustment of insulin based on model 2 decrease the magnitude of the amylin - MetS association ( with an OR of 1. 85, 95% CI: 1. 21 – 2. 85 ), the association of amylin with MetS is still statistically significant ( P = 0. 001 for trend ).

Our analysis of Aplysia only iGluR genes indicated that NMDAR and AMPAR subunits form well - defined clades and thus may be capable of forming functional iGluR channels.

Viral capsids are formed of at least one virus - encoded capsid protein ( CP ), which is often multifunctional, playing additional non - structural roles during the infection cycle.

In animal viruses, there are examples of differential localization of CPs associated to the progression of the infection and / or enabled by other viral proteins; these changes in the distribution of CPs may ultimately regulate the involvement of these proteins in different viral functions.

Expression of the viral replication - associated protein, Rep, is sufficient to exclude the CP from the nucleolus, but the localization of the CP in the characteristic patterns induced by the virus cannot be recapitulated by co - expression with any individual viral protein.	"viral replication - associated protein	18	56	Gene/Protein"	"Rep	58	61	Gene/Protein"	"CP	92	94	Gene/Protein"	"CP	143	145	Gene/Protein"	"virus	192	197	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""viral replication - associated protein"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""Rep"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""CP"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""CP"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""virus"", ""start_span"": 192, ""end_span"": 197, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Expression of the viral replication - associated protein, Rep, is sufficient to exclude the CP from the nucleolus, but the localization of the CP in the characteristic patterns induced by TYLCV requires more than a single viral protein.	"viral replication - associated protein	18	56	Gene/Protein"	"Rep	58	61	Gene/Protein"	"CP	92	94	Gene/Protein"	"CP	143	145	Gene/Protein"	"TYLCV	188	193	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""viral replication - associated protein"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""Rep"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""CP"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""CP"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""TYLCV"", ""start_span"": 188, ""end_span"": 193, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This effect of the presence of the virus on the localization of the CP can also be detected in N. benthamiana and tomato upon transient expression of a RFP - CP fusion protein ( Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure S1 ).	"virus	35	40	Organism/Species"	"CP	68	70	Gene/Protein"	"tomato	114	120	Organism/Species"	"RFP	152	155	Gene/Protein"	"CP	158	160	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""virus"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""CP"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""tomato"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""RFP"", ""start_span"": 152, ""end_span"": 155, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""CP"", ""start_span"": 158, ""end_span"": 160, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
As shown in Figure 3, in the absence of the virus the CP – CP interaction can be detected as YFP signal strongly in the nucleolus and weakly in the nucleoplasm, mirroring the distribution of the CP.	"virus	44	49	Organism/Species"	"CP	54	56	Gene/Protein"	"CP	59	61	Gene/Protein"	"YFP	93	96	Gene/Protein"	"CP	195	197	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""virus"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""CP"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""CP"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""YFP"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""CP"", ""start_span"": 195, ""end_span"": 197, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In the presence of the virus, however, the sites of CP – CP interaction shift, weakening in or disappearing from the nucleolus, and appearing as distinct speckles in the nucleoplasm ( Figure 3B ), which correlates with the observed localization of CP in TYLCV - infected cells ( Figure 1B ).	"virus	23	28	Organism/Species"	"CP	52	54	Gene/Protein"	"CP	57	59	Gene/Protein"	"CP	248	250	Gene/Protein"	"TYLCV	254	259	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""virus"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""CP"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""CP"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""CP"", ""start_span"": 248, ""end_span"": 250, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""TYLCV"", ""start_span"": 254, ""end_span"": 259, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Gray columns show the virus gene expression level when each viral gene is independently co - expressed with CP - GFP ( left) or GFP - CP ( right) from a binary vector.

In the case of the geminivirus TYLCV, subcellular localization of the CP has been previously studied ( Rojas et al ., 2001 ); however, in these experiments the CP was expressed in isolation, and therefore in the absence of other viral proteins, the viral genome, and the cellular changes triggered by the viral infection.

Interestingly, our results are reminiscent of those obtained by Wistuba et al. ( 1997) when studying the subnuclear localization of the capsid proteins from AAV - 2, which show a redistribution from the nucleolus to nuclear bodies following the progression of the infection and an influence of Rep proteins in the distribution of viral capsids.

It is interesting to note that changes in the localization of ALY proteins, including ALY4, have been reported upon co - expression with Tomato bushy stunt virus p19 protein ( Uhrig et al ., 2004 ); in this case, ALY4 relocalizes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.

In the second scenario, host miRNAs interact with viral RNAs, thereby inhibiting virus replication, e. g ., miR - 32 can limit the replication of the retrovirus primate foamy virus ( PFV) in cell culture through an interaction with PFV mRNAs [ 19 ].

To understand the potential underlying mechanisms, we re - analyzed the previously reported protein interactome data, which revealed that 94 interactors were shared between Shank3 and upstream regulators of mTORC1 ( TSC1, TSC2 and Rhes ).

Altogether, our results suggest a protein interaction - mediated connectivity between Shank3 and certain upstream regulators of mTORC1 that might contribute to the abnormal striatal mTORC1 activity and, at least in part, to the manic - like behaviors of Shank3 TG mice.

We found that the phosphorylation level of mTOR S2448 normalized to total mTOR expression was significantly decreased by approximately 15% in the striatum of Shank3 TG mice compared to that of WT mice ( Figure 1E ).

As a control, the intensity of NeuN staining in the three subareas of the dorsal striatum in Shank3 TG mice was comparable to that in WT mice, suggesting a normal neuronal density in the Shank3 TG striatum ( Supplementary Figure S3 ).

Therefore, we also tested for the existence of the in vivo protein complex consisting of Shank3, Rhes and WAVE1 in the synaptosomal lysate from Shank3 TG mice.

This result is consistent with the previous study of “ Rhesactome ”, in which the authors performed IP using Rhes antibodies to pull down endogenous Rhes proteins from the striatal lysate of WT mice, and identified Shank3 and WAVE1 proteins in the complex using mass spectrometry analysis ( Shahani et al ., 2016 ).

In this regard, we reasoned that neuropsychiatric disorders affected by pathological Shank3 - mTORC1 interactions might be identified as those significantly associated with the 94 proteins connecting Shank3 and the upstream regulators of mTORC1.

The increase in Proteobacteria confirmed the results of earlier studies [ 12, 13] using bronchial brushings from asthma patients who were on inhaled corticosteroid treatment, where Haemophilus was particularly seen to be increased, with the former study also reporting a decrease in Prevotella.

The other important observation is that the gut microbiota has been reported to completely metabolise corticosteroids such as prednisolone, beclomethasone dipropionate and budesonide, but the effect of the airway microbiota in this context remains unknown [ 42 ].

Since our patients with severe asthma may be classified as being corticosteroid - insensitive as demonstrated by studies on peripheral blood mononuclear cells or alveolar macrophages [ 43, 44 ], the recent study by Goleva and colleagues on bronchoalveolar lavage microbiota of patients defined as corticosteroid - resistant and corticosteroid insensitive is of interest [ 23 ].

In summary, we have shown that in severe asthma, there is a distinct alteration of the sputum microbiota with a greater prominence of Firmicutes ( including 2 Streptococcal OTUs, and a lower prominence of Bacteroidetes, particularly Prevotella spp.	"asthma	41	47	Disease/Disorder"	"microbiota	94	104	Organism/Species"	"Firmicutes	134	144	Organism/Species"	"Bacteroidetes	205	218	Organism/Species"	"Prevotella spp	233	247	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""asthma"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""microbiota"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Firmicutes"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Bacteroidetes"", ""start_span"": 205, ""end_span"": 218, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Prevotella spp"", ""start_span"": 233, ""end_span"": 247, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"

REV - ERBα repressed the Bmal1 :: luc reporter as expected, and also repressed the Fgf21 :: luc reporter ( Fig. 2B) in a dose - dependent manner.	"REV - ERBα	0	10	Gene/Protein"	"Bmal1	25	30	Gene/Protein"	"luc	34	37	Gene/Protein"	"Fgf21	83	88	Gene/Protein"	"luc	92	95	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""REV - ERB\u03b1"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""Bmal1"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""luc"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""Fgf21"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""luc"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Mutation of the R1 element in the Fgf21 :: luc reporter reduced the repressive potential of REV - ERBα ( Fig. 2C ), which is consistent with previous findings that REV - ERBα may repress Fgf21 expression via this RORE site ( Estall et al ., 2009 ).	"Fgf21	34	39	Gene/Protein"	"luc	43	46	Gene/Protein"	"REV - ERBα	92	102	Gene/Protein"	"REV - ERBα	164	174	Gene/Protein"	"Fgf21	187	192	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Fgf21"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""luc"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""REV - ERB\u03b1"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""REV - ERB\u03b1"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""Fgf21"", ""start_span"": 187, ""end_span"": 192, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Since the classical mechanism of REV - ERBα - mediated repression involves competition with the transcriptional activator RORα, we tested whether RORα activates the Fgf21 :: luc construct.	"REV - ERBα	33	43	Gene/Protein"	"RORα	122	126	Gene/Protein"	"RORα	146	150	Gene/Protein"	"Fgf21	165	170	Gene/Protein"	"luc	174	177	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""REV - ERB\u03b1"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""ROR\u03b1"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""ROR\u03b1"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""Fgf21"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 170, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""luc"", ""start_span"": 174, ""end_span"": 177, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Accordingly, the repression by REV - ERBα on this promoter only partially repressed activation and in absence of HNF6, REV - ERBα alone did not repress the Fgf21 :: luc reporter below baseline levels ( Fig. 2E ).	"REV - ERBα	31	41	Gene/Protein"	"HNF6	113	117	Gene/Protein"	"REV - ERBα	119	129	Gene/Protein"	"Fgf21	156	161	Gene/Protein"	"luc	165	168	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""REV - ERB\u03b1"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""HNF6"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""REV - ERB\u03b1"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""Fgf21"", ""start_span"": 156, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""luc"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 168, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Because we identified a PPAR binding site ( P in Fig. 2C) between the RORE R1 and R2, we tested whether PPARα, together with its heterodimerizing partner RXRα, may modulate the Fgf21 :: luc reporter.	"PPAR	24	28	Gene/Protein"	"PPARα	104	109	Gene/Protein"	"RXRα	154	158	Gene/Protein"	"Fgf21	177	182	Gene/Protein"	"luc	186	189	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PPAR"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""PPAR\u03b1"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""RXR\u03b1"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""Fgf21"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 182, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""luc"", ""start_span"": 186, ""end_span"": 189, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Addition of Per2 increased this activation further ( Fig. 2G ), indicating that PPARα, RXRα and Per2 have an activating function on the Fgf21 promoter.

Similar to HNF6, PPARα binding to the Fgf21 promoter was not time - of - day dependent, with strong binding at both ZT8 and ZT20 in both wild - type and Rev - erbα −/− mice ( Fig. 3C ).

( D) Binding of PER2 on the Bmal1 and Fgf21 promoters in the liver of wild - type ( black bars) and Rev - erbα −/− ( red bars) animals at ZT8 and ZT20.

Because PER2 can bind to both REV - ERBα and PPARα ( Schmutz et al ., 2010 ), we tested PER2 binding to the Fgf21 promoter.	"PER2	8	12	Gene/Protein"	"REV - ERBα	30	40	Gene/Protein"	"PPARα	45	50	Gene/Protein"	"PER2	88	92	Gene/Protein"	"Fgf21	108	113	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PER2"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""REV - ERB\u03b1"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""PPAR\u03b1"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""PER2"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""Fgf21"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Hence, Rev - erbα −/− animals can be considered as Fgf21 overexpressors, although they overexpress Fgf21 to a much lesser extent compared to the transgenic mice described by Owen et al. ( 2013 ).	"Rev - erbα	7	17	Gene/Protein"	"animals	22	29	Organism/Species"	"Fgf21	51	56	Gene/Protein"	"Fgf21	99	104	Gene/Protein"	"mice	156	160	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Rev - erb\u03b1"", ""start_span"": 7, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""animals"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Fgf21"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""Fgf21"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 156, ""end_span"": 160, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This indicates that the Fgf21 promoter is most likely not activated by BMAL1 / CLOCK or BMAL1 / NPAS2 heterodimers in vivo.	"Fgf21	24	29	Gene/Protein"	"BMAL1	71	76	Gene/Protein"	"CLOCK	79	84	Gene/Protein"	"BMAL1	88	93	Gene/Protein"	"NPAS2	96	101	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Fgf21"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""BMAL1"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""CLOCK"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""BMAL1"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""NPAS2"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Therefore, we tested whether RORα induces the Fgf21 :: luc reporter in a dose - dependent manner as it does for the Bmal1 :: luc reporter.

Whereas the direct competition mechanism between REV - ERBα and ROR transcription factors provides a universal mechanism for self - sustained control of the molecular clock across all tissues, REV - ERBα uses lineage - determining factors to convey a tissue - specific rhythm that regulates metabolism tailored to the specific need of that tissue ( Zhang et al ., 2015 ).

In this paper we analyze gene gain and loss at a genomic scale by studying the expansion and contraction of gene families in the whole genomes of human, chimpanzee, mouse, rat, and dog.

This agrees with recent results showing that differences between humans and mice are a result of both accelerated loss in humans and addition of functional OR genes in mice [ 48 ].

Therefore, given the role GABAARs may play in a number of disorders including autism, schizophrenia, Fragile X and Down syndrome ( Deidda et al ., 2014, Rudolph and Mohler, 2014 ), these findings may not only be important in better understanding how phasic GABAergic neurotransmission changes to accommodate the demands of neuronal network activity during development, but may additionally allow new insights into the pathology of certain neurodevelopmental disorders.

The production of NO is both necessary and sufficient to trigger Ca2 + sparks, as stretch – induced Ca2 + sparks were not activated under conditions of NOS inhibition or in eNOS knockout smooth muscle, and exogenous NO restored stretch – induced Ca2 + release in eNOS knockout cells, indicating that, NO mediates stretch - induced Ca2 + release through activation of PI ( 3) K - Akt − endothelial NOS axis in smooth muscle.

For this reason, we examined the levels of this kinase in MDA - MB - 231 ( claudin low ), SKBR3 ( HER2 +) and MCF7 ( luminal) breast cancer cell lines and found that as expected, NIK is highly expressed in MDA - MB - 231 cells and barely detectable in MCF7 cells ( Supplementary Fig.	"kinase	48	54	Gene/Protein"	"claudin	75	82	Gene/Protein"	"HER2	98	102	Gene/Protein"	"breast cancer	126	139	Disease/Disorder"	"NIK	179	182	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""kinase"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""claudin"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""HER2"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""breast cancer"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""NIK"", ""start_span"": 179, ""end_span"": 182, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In addition, MDA - MB - 231 BCSCs also exhibited higher levels of NIK when compared to CD44 −/ ESA − cells ( Fig. 2B ); furthermore NIK is highly expressed in MDA - MB - 231 cells with ALDH activity ( Supplementary Fig.	"NIK	66	69	Gene/Protein"	"CD44	87	91	Gene/Protein"	"ESA	95	98	Gene/Protein"	"NIK	132	135	Gene/Protein"	"ALDH	185	189	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NIK"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD44"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""ESA"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""NIK"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""ALDH"", ""start_span"": 185, ""end_span"": 189, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

These results suggest that elevated levels of MARCH7 aids in the progress of ovarian cancer, and promotes an aggressive behavior, indicating that MARCH7 may function as a novel tumor marker and a potential therapeutic target for ovarian cancer.

Finally, we assessed the effects of IL - 17 in the context of patient outcome, following intravesical BCG immunotherapy which is the standard of care; higher numbers of IL - 17 + cells were associated with improved event - free survival ( p = 0. 0449, HR 0. 2918, 95% CI 0. 08762 – 0. 9721) in patients with primary and concomitant CIS ( n = 41 ), we propose a model of IL - 17 + Mast cells mechanism of action.

Examining transcripts related to and downstream of IL - 17, we similarly measured increased mRNA levels of the related cytokine IL - 17F as well as IL - 6, the expression of which is upregulated by IL - 17 [ 26] ( Fig 2D and 2E ).

As shown in Fig 4E, cells positive for both MCT and IL - 17 were observed in all cases confirming that MCs are the main source of IL - 17 in the tumour microenvironment of bladder CIS.

However, IL - 17 has been implicated in the efficacy of BCG immunotherapy in a murine bladder cancer model [ 25 ]; although patients with high grade NMIBC should be offered intravesical BCG, not all patients actually receive this treatment.

In this model, IL - 17 was required for BCG efficacy through IL - 8 production and increased neutrophil recruitment, in keeping with clinical data showing increased IL - 8, within the first few hours of BCG treatment is predictive of response [ 12, 55, 56 ].

It has been shown in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe [ 5 - 8] and the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae [ 1, 9 - 12] that a number of transcription factors dramatically modulate the transcriptome to facilitate meiosis, thereby playing critical roles in meiotic progression and sporulation ( gametogenesis ).

Thus, these results indicate that αMSH exerted a mitogenic effect in primary human melanocytes while it reduced melanoma cell proliferation.

The first series of experiments evidenced that while in primary cultures of human melanocytes the αMSH acted as a mitogenic agent [ 1, 3 ], in Mel 13 human melanoma cell line and in the B16 - F10 murine melanoma cell line, this hormone did not exert the same effect.

Subsequent experiments, carried out by stimulating the cells with 3 M3 ( or αMSH ), after inhibition of PPARγ with GW9662, led to similar results in the two conditions, thereby highlighting the role of PPARγ as an effector element ( triggered by the active PI ( 4, 5) P2 / PLC pathway) capable of mediating the phenomenon.

In regard to the mechanism by which SEA negatively regulates TLR4 signaling, we hypothesized that S. mansoni SEA has to be recognized and internalized by lectin - receptors present on DCs to suppress the cytokine production from LPS - activated DCs, and / or to enhance expression levels of SOCS1 and SHP1.

In a subset common cohort of 40 primary myxofibrosarcomas yielding informative scoring results ( Table S6, Figure S4 ), we further corroborated the in vitro findings in clinical samples that MTAP protein deficiency was highly associated with increased Ki - 67 labeling index ( p < 0. 001 ), microvessel density ( p = 0. 002) assessed by CD31 staining [ 18 ], and MMP - 9 expression levels ( p < 0. 001) evaluated by H - score method [ 19 ].

Because L - alanosine can completely abrogate AMP supply in MTAP - deficient cells, we investigated whether L - alanosine can effectively inhibit this aggressive subset of myxofibrosarcomas by targeting the methionine de novo pathway [ 13 ].

Analogously, MMP - 9 overexpression in the ASS1 - deficient and MTAP - deficient myxofibrosarcomas is likely mediated by overexpressed ODC, which converges growth - promoting signals to orchestrate transcriptional regulation.

In addition, we demonstrated that myxofibrosarcomas fundamentally depended on MTAP deficiency regarding their susceptibility to L - alanosine, which effectively inhibited the MTAP - deficient cell lines and derived xenografts and was well - tolerated by the mice.

Since several antimetabolites targeting purine synthesis are available and additional drugs are in development [ 32 – 34 ], the findings of this study suggest that MTAP - deficient myxofibrosarcomas may benefit from the chemoselective targeting of the defects in methionine - adenine recycling and AMP synthesis.

In summary, MTAP deficiency in myxofibrosarcomas, and particularly that caused by homozygous deletion, negatively affects prognosis. In vitro and in vivo, MTAP may act as a tumor suppressor, serving antiangiogenic, antiproliferative, and antimigratory or antiinvasive functions, and its deficiency represents a potential therapeutic target of myxofibrosarcomas.

These findings help elucidate the genetic interplay between Rad54 and Parp - 1 by suggesting that p53 / p21 - mediated apoptosis and / or senescence may be involved in synthetic lethal interactions occurring during development and inhibition of tumor growth.

The Rad54 gene encodes a dsDNA - dependent ATPase of the Swi2 / Snf2 family [ 9 ], which interacts directly with Rad51 [ 10, 11 ], and stimulates its DNA exchange activity [ 12 ].

Interestingly, several point mutations in conserved regions of the Rad54 gene family have been found in primary tumors ( e. g ., breast and colon carcinomas and lymphomas) [ 14, 15 ], and approximately half of epithelial ovarian cancers have alterations in genes regulating HR repair [ 16 ].

We also showed that combined loss of Ptc1 and Rad54 or of Ptc1 and Parp - 1 increased radiation induced MB [ 21, 22 ].

Although no significant differences were detected between Rad54 and Parp - 1 single and compound mutants in phosphorylation of p53 at Ser18 [ 27 ], we observed a significant increase in total p53 expression ( 3 - fold) only in compound mutants, indicating marked p53 activation ( Figure 6A ), which is consistent with persistent genetic damage.

We observed not only that the combination is active in vivo, but could also clarify that Parp - 1 is not strictly necessary for HR during early embryogenesis, as combined deletions of Parp - 1 and Rad54 caused significantly reduced birth rate and growth retardation - resulting in early death of Rad54 -/-/ Parp - 1 -/- pups - not full embryonic lethality.

Our results of p53 expression in P1 - cerebellum and MEFs are in line with the fact that deficiency in several DNA repair genes such as DNA Lig4, XRCC4 and Rad51 cause increased level of genotoxic stress, triggering a p53 - dependent DNA damage response leading to embryonic lethality [ 40 – 42 ].

Let us consider the experiment that consists in comparing the phosphorylation of ERK induced by the FSH between untreated cells and cells treated with an inhibitor of protein kinase A ( PKA) ( for example, with the H89 inhibitor23 ).

The result of the experiment is that the phosphorylation of ERK induced by FSH is hampered by the inhibitor, from which an expert can make the hypothesis that PKA might be an intermediary of the activation of ERK by FSH.

From this first conclusion, two alternatives appear: either Ya can influence Za independently from Xa ( activated PKA stimulates the phosphorylation of ERK independently of FSH) and no other additional conclusion has to be made, or Ya is an intermediary of the induction of Za by Xa, meaning that additionally, Xa stimulates the transformation of Y into Ya ( FSH stimulates the activation of PKA ).

Semi - quantitative RT - PCR analysis of total mRNA excluded the possibility of a severe drop in transcription of CDC19, PFK1 or ACT1 genes in the elp3uba4 double mutant, strongly suggesting the significantly reduced abundance of Cdc19 and Pfk1 in this strain results from a translational rather than a transcriptional defect or a combination of a translational defect with the induction cell death ( Fig. 3F ).

This suggests that Bd0881 controls, or optimises, the transcription of some genes involved in the predatory lifestyle while Bd0743 does not and thus Bd0881 is the first experimentally identified Bdellovibrio transcriptional regulator of predation genes.

Thus the similarity in expression patterns of fliC3 gene and bd0881 during predation may imply that Bd0881 protein is involved in regulatory events to do with the timepoints where flagella are being synthesised, i. e. around septation, but the fact that ΔBd0881 mutants are not immotile shows that Bd0881 is not required for the “ all or nothing ” induction of the fliC3 gene expression itself.

In previous studies on the six different flagellins that are incorporated into the flagellar propeller of Bdellovibrio [ 11, 17 ], we found that different flagellin compositions of a single Bdellovibrio flagellum are possible, and that in the case of a fliC4 mutant, for example, an apparently wild type - length flagellum gave a lower swimming speed than wild type [ 11] suggesting an altered filament rigidity.

We have investigated the invasiveness of primary chicken embryo intestinal cells ( CEICs) by C. jejuni strains of human and chicken origins and the production of pro - inflammatory cytokines as well as the expression of the bacterial virulence - associated genes during co - cultivation.

Furthermore, incubation of bacteria with conditioned cell - and bacteria - free media from another co - cultivation experiment also increased the expression of the virulence - associated genes in the C. jejuni chicken isolate, indicating that the expression of bacterial genes is regulated by component ( s) secreted upon co - cultivation of bacteria and CEICs.

Previous studies have shown that C. jejuni can invade human - derived epithelial cell cultures [ 8, 9] and induce the production of a number of cytokines and chemokines during the course of experimental infections [ 10 - 15 ], as well as in clinical Campylobacter infections [ 16 ].

Therefore, we used primary chicken embryo intestinal cells ( CEICs) as a model to compare the cytokine responses of CEICs elicited by C. jejuni strains of human and chicken origin, as well as the concomitant expression of the virulence - associated genes of C. jejuni.

Interleukin - 8 is a pro - inflammatory cytokine, a potent chemotactic factor for many immune effector cells, and a mediator of localized inflammatory responses [ 28 ]. Campylobacter strains have exhibited variability in the induction of CXCL8, and those strains with a high ability to invade intestinal epithelial cells frequently induce the high levels of CXCL8 [ 12 ].

The medium of non - inoculated CEICs suppressed the expression of the virulence - associated genes in chicken strain SC11, especially for genes ciaB and dnaJ ( p ≤ 0. 081 ), while slightly increased in human strain HM5040 ( Figure 5 ).

The assessment of the prognostic value of IL - 8 genetic marker in breast carcinoma confirmed the results of our previous study and indicated that IL - 8 (- 251) A allele is highly associated with aggressive forms of breast carcinoma as defined by large tumor size, high grade and lymph node metastases.

Given the importance of IL - 8 and CXCR2 in angiogenesis, we investigated the relationship between polymorphisms - 251 T / A in IL - 8 gene and (+ 1208) C / T in CXCR2 gene and breast carcinoma.

There is now convincing evidence that these correlations between IL - 8 A allele and cancer risk result from an increased level of IL - 8 protein, which may have an impact on cancer development and progression via the regulation of immune response and pathways of tumor angiogenesis.

Since CXCR2 binds to all ELR + CXC chemokines that induce angiogenesis, including IL - 8, it may be safe to say that CXCR2 is a mediator of the proangiogenic effects of IL - 8.

In some types of primary neurons and in endothelial cells, proneurotrophin binding to the p75NTR - sortilin receptor complex is a potent apoptotic stimulus [ 7, 9, 10] and several studies have demonstrated the importance of proNGF and proBDNF for inducing apoptosis in vivo [ 7, 10 – 15 ].

In order to address this issue, plasma dilutions from 14 HIV - positive individuals were used as source of HIV - specific antibodies and then incubated with CXCR4 - tropic strains of HIV IIIB.

Since gp160 is the precursor of gp120 and gp41, a possible explanation is that such antibodies are present but they are not detected due to higher affinity to gp160.

This therefore, suggests that the association of IgGs anti - HIV to erythrocytes has a relevant role in HIV availability in plasma but it is not enough to significantly modify the quantification of IgGs anti - HIV.

It is becoming increasingly supported by experimental evidence that some human bacterial pathogens can colonize plants and cause disease ( Kirzinger et al ., 2011 ).

Multiple candidate gene association studies and genome wide association studies have led to discovery of more than 30 susceptibility loci throughout the whole genome, most of which are involved in three main pathways in lupus pathogenesis: abnormal clearance of nuclear debris and immune complexes, over - activation of innate immune system through Toll - like receptor ( TLR) and type I interferon ( IFN) signaling, and aberrant adaptive immune response through B and T cell signaling ( 6, 7 ).

There was lower prevalence in anti - dsDNA antibodies in RBP − AA patients ( 77% of RBP + vs. 31% of RBP − had anti - dsDNA antibodies, P = 0. 005 ).

In the RBP − patients, there is essentially no increase in IFN - induced gene expression in AA patients, while the expression of these genes, in particular PKR, is increased in the RBP − EA SLE patients.

Because anti - dsDNA antibodies have been associated with high IFN - α ( 25, 26 ), it is important to determine whether anti - dsDNA antibodies are contributing to the induction of IFN - induced gene expression we observe in our RBP − EA patients.	"antibodies	21	31	Gene/Protein"	"IFN - α	63	70	Gene/Protein"	"antibodies	133	143	Gene/Protein"	"IFN	181	184	Gene/Protein"	"RBP	229	232	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""antibodies"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""IFN - \u03b1"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""antibodies"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""IFN"", ""start_span"": 181, ""end_span"": 184, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""RBP"", ""start_span"": 229, ""end_span"": 232, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
When we looked at the RBP negative patients in the qPCR replication cohorts with regard to presence or absence of anti - dsDNA antibodies, there was no significant difference in IFIT1, MX1, or PKR over - expression in the AA subjects.

The Wnt pathway is frequently activated in HCC. 3 4 Various attempts have been made to develop therapeutics targeting the Wnt pathway components, and some of these are now under clinical evaluation. 5 However, the challenges faced in the development of Wnt inhibitors, such as specificity and toxicity, demand a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in Wnt deregulation, in order to inform the design of more specific and more effective compounds.

To verify if these T - UCRs were specifically altered by Wnt / β - catenin or just affected by the malignant transformation, we profiled T - UCR expression in the livers of mice treated with DEN, which developed a median of 17 ( range: 13 – 36) tumours per liver with no nuclear activation of β - catenin ( see online supplementary figure S1 ).
