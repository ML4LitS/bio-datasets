We have observed that co - expression with Rep is sufficient to trigger nucleolar exclusion of the CP and its dotted distribution in the nucleoplasm ( Figure 4 ); however, and since Rep is not sufficient to recapitulate all different stages of CP localization that are distinguishable upon TYLCV infection, it is possible that active viral replication / encapsidation is required for this.

However, none of these potential “ Shank3 target genes ” was listed among mTORC1 signaling - related genes from our RNA - seq analysis ( Supplementary Table S5 ), suggesting that mTORC1 signaling - related genes in the striatum of Shank3 TG mice were not directly up - regulated by nuclear Shank3 proteins.

To understand the detailed mechanism underlying decreased mTORC1 activity in the Shank3 TG striatum, we re - analyzed the Shank3, TSC1 / TSC2 and Rhes protein interactomes side by side.

This was based on the previous reports showing the PPI - mediated connectivity between Shank3 and TSC1 / TSC2 ( Sakai et al ., 2011 ), and the striatal in vivo Rhes protein complex (“ Rhesactome ”) containing Shank3 and several Shank3 - interacting proteins ( Shahani et al ., 2016 ).

However, one of the limitations of this interactome is not being strict enough to fully represent the in vivo connections among Shank3, TSC1 / TSC2 and Rhes, because some of the interactions, especially those for TSC1 / TSC2, were identified based only on in vitro Y2H screening.

Similarly, it was recently shown that, in the mouse striatum, RasGRP1 suppresses the inhibitory role of Rhes in amphetamine - induced dopamine receptor signaling, by promoting Rhes to form a specific protein complex ( Shahani et al ., 2016 ).

Therefore, investigating the role of these Shank3 - related BD genes, together with mTORC1 signaling, in Shank3 TG mice might enable us to fully understand the molecular mechanisms of manic - like behaviors in these mice.

We also noted that although there was a robust increase in HR in response to 5 μg · kg − 1 · minute − 1 dobutamine in both young and aged animals prior to commencement of tachypacing, at the onset of HF, we found no change in HR response to doses of dobutamine less than 20 μg · kg − 1 · minute − 1 ( Figure 2D ); thus, the chronotropic response to β - adrenergic stimulation is reduced in HF in both age groups although appears to occur earlier in the aged animals.

In young HF animals, the effective dose of dobutamine ( 10 – 40 µg · kg − 1 · minute − 1) increased contractility by 31% ± 13% ( p <. 05) and in aged HF sheep, the effective dose of dobutamine ( 20 µg · kg − 1 · minute − 1) increased fractional area change by 29% ± 15% ( p <. 05 ).

However, although the aged HF animals develop impaired inotropic and chronotropic responses to β - adrenergic stimulation earlier than the young HF animals, there are no age - dependent difference in β - adrenergic responsiveness once HF has developed, that is, HF results in a marked attenuation of the chronotropic response in both the young and aged.

Each of these functions would fit with the role of NLRs as intracellular PRRs; the ability to bind viruses could be an extension of the pattern detection system attributed to the neighboring LRR domain, while the potential to inhibit caspase - 1 activity may make NLR - C molecules important negative regulators of the inflammasome in teleost fish.

In contrast, the Fgf21 :: luc reporter was not induced, indicating that BMAL1 and CLOCK are not regulating the Fgf21 promoter and hence are probably not directly responsible for the diurnal expression of Fgf21 mRNA observed in Fig. 1D.

As expected, RORα could activate the Bmal1 :: luc reporter in a dose - dependent manner ( Fig. 2D ), however, the Fgf21 :: luc reporter did not or only poorly respond to RORα ( Fig. 2D ).

Therefore, we suspected that Fgf21 is indirectly regulated by REV - ERBα via hepatic nuclear factor 6 ( HNF6 ), a second mechanism through which REV - ERBα can act ( Zhang et al ., 2015) ( see also the presence of an HNF6 binding site H in Fig. 2C ).

We found that Hnf6 shRNA, but not scrambled shRNA, increased the luciferase activity in the Fgf21 :: luc reporter, suggesting that HNF6 is a direct modulator of this promoter, and the lack of it increases baseline expression of Fgf21.

Mutating this HNF6 binding site abolished REV - ERBα mediated repression of the Fgf21 :: luc reporter ( Fig. 2F ), indicating that repression of this reporter by REV - ERBα requires the binding of HNF6.

Because Fgf21 expression in liver is increased in Rev - erbα −/− animals ( Fig. 1D ), reminiscent of the increased expression of Bmal1 ( Preitner et al ., 2002 ), we tested whether the Fgf21 promoter could be repressed by REV - ERBα.

Addition of an equimolar concentration of Hp to Hb severely inhibited binding of TLF to cells, resulting in binding levels similar to the TLF binding observed in the absence of Hb, either by sequestering all available Hb or by competition for the trypanosome TLF – Hb receptor.

Nevertheless, catfishes and all other otophysines never completely lose their swim bladders, in contrast to other fish taxa ( e. g. gobiids, bleniids, cottids ), most likely because of their auditory function [ 14 ], [ 46 ].

Next, using cell studies and monensin to inhibit endosomal / lysosomal acidification [ 39 ], we showed a monensin - dose - dependent reduction ( i. e.

Two such enzyme activities, essential for the detoxification of benzoxazinoids ( antimicrobials produced by maize, wheat and rye ), have been mapped at genetic loci FDB1 and FDB2 of the endophytic filamentous ascomycete Fusarium verticillioides5.

Here, we show that this isoenzyme selectively employs malonyl - CoA to catalyze N - malonyl transfer to an arylamine, and that this enzymatic reaction is specific to the NAT1 homologues of F. verticillioides [( GIBM7) NAT1] and F. graminearum [( GIBZE) NAT1 ], the two fungi in our panel that are naturally exposed to BOA through their endophytic association with cereals.

Homologous NAT isoenzymes are also predicted for the tomato pathogen F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici [( FUSO4) NAT1] and potentially for the non - endophytic maize pathogen A. flavus [( ASPFN) NAT3 ], although the N - malonyltransferase activity detected with those recombinant proteins was very low.

Conversely, for group II N - malonyltransferases [( GIBM7) NAT1, ( GIBZE) NAT1, ( FUSO4) NAT1 and ( ASPFN) NAT3 ], the increase in Tm was substantial only with malonyl - CoA ( Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig.	"N - malonyltransferases	25	48	Gene/Protein"	"NAT1	59	63	Gene/Protein"	"NAT1	74	78	Gene/Protein"	"NAT1	89	93	Gene/Protein"	"NAT3	107	111	Gene/Protein"	"malonyl - CoA	160	173	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""N - malonyltransferases"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""NAT1"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""NAT1"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""NAT1"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""NAT3"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""malonyl - CoA"", ""start_span"": 160, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The results of the DSF analysis indicated that the NAT homologues of group III, appearing as functionally redundant in our activity assays with various acyl - CoAs ( Fig. 1 ), are in fact capable of binding acetyl -, n - propionyl -, malonyl - and succinyl - CoA [( GIBM7) NAT2, ( GIBZE) NAT2 and ( FUSO4) NAT2 ].

To our knowledge, these are the first NAT isoenzymes conclusively shown to have specificity for malonyl - CoA instead of the typical acetyl - CoA. F. oxysporum and A. flavus also appear to possess a NAT homologue preferentially binding malonyl - CoA, but N - malonyltransferase activity was low with arylamine in preparations of both recombinant proteins and cell lysates.

In keeping with growth delay, cerebella from Rad54 -/-/ Parp - 1 -/-/ Ptc1 +/- mice showed shallow principal fissures at P1 relative to Ptc1 +/- mice ( asterisks in Figure 3C ).

Similarly high growth rates were not observed in Rad54 -/-/ Parp - 1 -/-/ Ptc1 +/- mice, suggesting that persistent SSBs formation due to Parp - 1 inhibition, promoting collapse of replication forks and DSBs which would normally be repaired by HR, cannot be repaired effectively in the absence of functional Rad54.

To evaluate the effects of combined inactivation of Rad54 and Parp - 1 on differentiation processes, we measured the areas of the EGL and IGL in the cerebellum of Ptc1 +/- mice with single or combined inactivation of Rad54 or Parp - 1 at P7, and calculated their ratio.

Moreover, MEFs from Rad54 -/-/ Parp - 1 -/-/ Ptc1 +/- mice showed decreased cell growth potential compared to those from Ptc1 +/- mice.

We also detected a significantly greater fraction of positive cells after staining with Senescence - Associated β - Galactosidase ( SA - β - GAL) ( 1. 6 - fold; P = 0. 048 ), a biomarker of senescent cells, accompanied by senescence - associated morphological cellular changes ( i. e ., enlargement and flattening) ( Figure 6E and 6F ), suggesting accelerated acquisition of senescence in Rad54 -/-/ Parp - 1 -/-/ Ptc1 +/- compared to Ptc1 +/- MEFs.

Compared to Ptc1 +/- mice, we observed a general decrease in proliferation and increase in DNA damage in all tissues from Rad54 -/-/ Parp - 1 -/-/ Ptc1 +/- mice, particularly in thymus, intestine and kidneys ( Figure 6G - 6R ).	"Ptc1	12	16	Gene/Protein"	"mice	21	25	Organism/Species"	"Rad54	122	127	Gene/Protein"	"Parp - 1	133	141	Gene/Protein"	"Ptc1	147	151	Gene/Protein"	"mice	156	160	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Ptc1"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Rad54"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""Parp - 1"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""Ptc1"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 156, ""end_span"": 160, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Despite the critical role of the HR system for embryonic development, attenuated HR by deletion of Rad54 also did not result in lethality in Ptc1 +/- mice, implying redundancy in function of proteins involved in HR; however, in previous work, by exposing double Rad54 / Ptc1 mutants to 2 Gy, we detected significantly increased MB tumorigenesis, possibly through the generation of viable but genetically rearranged neural cell precursors due to repair of DNA lesions by error - prone mutagenic pathways [ 21 ].

The p53 - depedent apoptotic / senescent phenotypes is also potentially tumor protective; in fact, inactivation of one copy of Parp - 1 in Rad54 -/-/ Ptc1 +/- mutants suppressed radiation - induced MB tumorigenesis, identifying haplosufficient interactions also during neoplastic growth.

Genotyping for Ptc1 was performed as described [ 18 ]. Ptc1 +/- mice were crossed with Rad54 -/- or Parp - 1 -/- mice on C57Bl / 6 background [ 47, 48, 49 ], to produce an F1.

We therefore studied the presence of hemoparasites of the genera Haemoproteus, Plasmodium, Leucocytozoon and Trypanosoma, as well as microfilariae across populations of wild Psittaciformes.

For these parrot species, we summarized in Additional file 1: Table S1 the following information: ( i) number of individuals investigated ( adults and nestlings ); ( ii) number of individuals infected, including the total number, and the subtotals discriminated in Haemoproteus, Plasmodium, Leucocytozoon, Trypanosoma and microfilaria; ( iii) diets; ( iv) habitats used; ( v) climates; ( vi) screening methods used for parasite detection and ( vii) pertinent references.

All other 17 species of Psittaciformes sampled in this study, covering a wide range of habitats and climates in the Indo - Malayan, Australasian and Neotropical zoogeographical regions, were not infected by any of the tested hemoparasites ( Haemoproteus, Plasmodium, Leucocytozoon, Trypanosoma and microfilariae; Table 1 ).

When the data corresponding to the Psittaciformes sampled in this study were combined with the data from 24 studies previously investigating blood parasites in wild parrots ( Additional file 4 ), we found that 7 of 58 herbivorous wild parrots ( 12 %) were reported to be infected with Haemoproteus, Plasmodium or microfiliaria.

Possible sampling bias should be considered when interpreting our findings and should steer future work to assess how these patterns hold following additional surveys, particularly among poorly sampled parrot species such as the New Caledonian parakeet, horned parakeet, Ouvéa parakeet and orange - fronted parakeet ( Aratinga canicularis ).

Also, previous research on the hemoparasites of southern Chile showed that Haemoproteus, Plasmodium and Leucocytozoon were present in up to 13% of the sampled birds from the Nothofagus forest in Navarino [ 46 ], where our second austral parakeet population was sampled, thus suggesting that the necessary vectors were present.

These data and the finding that the groES2 gene is normally expressed in wild type Bdellovibrio only during the late stages of predation ( 2 – 4 hours) when the Bdellovibrio are septating and preparing to lyse the exhausted prey bdelloplast, may suggest that a modified chaperonin complex involving GroES2 is used in Bdellovibrio protein expression and folding that occurs at this point.
