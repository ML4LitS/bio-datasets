Here we show that ARTUMES ( ARU) specifically regulates the recognition of interspecific PTs in A. thaliana. ARU, identified in a genome - wide association study ( GWAS ), exclusively influences interspecific — but not intraspecific — gametophyte interactions. ARU encodes the OST3 / 6 subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex conferring protein N - glycosylation.

In contrast, aru mutants do not affect gametophytic communication in intraspecific A. thaliana crosses. ARU encodes the OST3 / 6 subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex, which is known to regulate site - and substrate - specific N - glycosylation of proteins in yeast2223 and a similar substrate specificity has been reported for A. thaliana OST3 / 6 ( ref. 24 ).	aru,13,16,Gene/Protein	ARU,104,107,Gene/Protein	OST3,120,124,Gene/Protein	oligosaccharyltransferase,144,169,Gene/Protein	yeast2223,271,280,Organism/Species	OST3,351,355,Gene/Protein	"[{""token"": ""aru"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""ARU"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""OST3"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""oligosaccharyltransferase"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 169, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""yeast2223"", ""start_span"": 271, ""end_span"": 280, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""OST3"", ""start_span"": 351, ""end_span"": 355, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"	test

Under basal conditions, most kynurenine is metabolized by astrocytes to KA, an N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA) and α7 - nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. 23, 24 However, inflammation and subsequent microglial activation is reported to shift kynurenine metabolism toward KMO - dependent production of QA. 20, 25 QA, an NMDAR agonist, can be particularly disruptive to the neuronal environment at higher concentrations, not only by elevating the potential for glutamate excitotoxicty but also by precipitating oxidative damage26 and potentiating pro - inflammation.	kynurenine,29,39,Chemical/Drug	α7 - nicotinic acetylcholine receptor,118,155,Gene/Protein	kynurenine,255,265,Chemical/Drug	KMO,284,287,Gene/Protein	NMDAR,332,337,Gene/Protein	glutamate,472,481,Chemical/Drug	"[{""token"": ""kynurenine"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""\u03b17 - nicotinic acetylcholine receptor"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 155, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""kynurenine"", ""start_span"": 255, ""end_span"": 265, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""KMO"", ""start_span"": 284, ""end_span"": 287, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""NMDAR"", ""start_span"": 332, ""end_span"": 337, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""glutamate"", ""start_span"": 472, ""end_span"": 481, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"	test

It is also possible that the chronic alterations in kynurenine metabolites that exist in the conventional KMO and HAAO null mice results in a compensatory recalibration of the reward system, as the effects of acute and subchronic elevations in KA on the dopaminergic system are well established. 58, 59 Although no baseline differences in SP were observed, it is of interest to note that the LPS - stimulated increase in nucleus accumbens KA could locally decrease extracellular dopamine, similar to a previously demonstrated effect of exogenous KA application to the striatum. 60 This local reduction in extracellular DA could contribute to the development of anhedonia behavior following LPS treatment.	kynurenine,52,62,Chemical/Drug	KMO,106,109,Gene/Protein	HAAO,114,118,Gene/Protein	mice,124,128,Organism/Species	dopamine,254,262,Chemical/Drug	anhedonia,661,670,Disease/Disorder	"[{""token"": ""kynurenine"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""KMO"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""HAAO"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""dopamine"", ""start_span"": 254, ""end_span"": 262, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""anhedonia"", ""start_span"": 661, ""end_span"": 670, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"	test

Thus, based on the current evidence, cattle introgression appears of low concern for wisent conservation for the following reasons: ( 1) admixture does not appear to have occurred since the establishment of the captive breeding program, although screening of additional individuals may be desirable to further support this generalization; ( 2) the number of intervening generations separating living wisent from the F1 hybrids is likely sufficient that all living wisent are admixed to some extent ( Chang 1999 ); and ( 3) our results may in fact reflect admixture with aurochs, rather than domestic cattle, although this hypothesis requires further investigation.	cattle,37,43,Organism/Species	wisent,85,91,Organism/Species	wisent,400,406,Organism/Species	wisent,464,470,Organism/Species	aurochs,570,577,Organism/Species	domestic cattle,591,606,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""cattle"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 400, ""end_span"": 406, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 464, ""end_span"": 470, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""aurochs"", ""start_span"": 570, ""end_span"": 577, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""domestic cattle"", ""start_span"": 591, ""end_span"": 606, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	test

However, none of these potential “ Shank3 target genes ” was listed among mTORC1 signaling - related genes from our RNA - seq analysis ( Supplementary Table S5 ), suggesting that mTORC1 signaling - related genes in the striatum of Shank3 TG mice were not directly up - regulated by nuclear Shank3 proteins.

However, one of the limitations of this interactome is not being strict enough to fully represent the in vivo connections among Shank3, TSC1 / TSC2 and Rhes, because some of the interactions, especially those for TSC1 / TSC2, were identified based only on in vitro Y2H screening.

They exhibit distinct profiles in various human cancers and modulate cellular proliferation and apoptosis. 19 – 25 We have previously shown that T - UCRs are aberrantly expressed in HCC and have a role in the malignant growth of human and murine hepatocytes. 25 In this study, we aim to investigate the effect of Wnt / β - catenin signalling on T - UCRs in order to find downstream effectors of this pathway that can be targeted for the development of novel and more specific therapeutics.	human,42,47,Organism/Species	cancers,48,55,Disease/Disorder	HCC,182,185,Disease/Disorder	human,229,234,Organism/Species	Wnt,313,316,Gene/Protein	β - catenin,319,330,Gene/Protein	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""cancers"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""HCC"", ""start_span"": 182, ""end_span"": 185, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 229, ""end_span"": 234, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Wnt"", ""start_span"": 313, ""end_span"": 316, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""\u03b2 - catenin"", ""start_span"": 319, ""end_span"": 330, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"	train
