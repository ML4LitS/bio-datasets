The major findings were ( i) cardiac dimensions are greater and indices of contractility are less in aged HF animals; ( ii) chronotropic and inotropic responses to β - adrenergic stimulation are reduced in both aged and young animals with HF but develop earlier in the progression of tachypacing - induced HF in the aged; ( iii) time - domain measures of HRV are reduced as a consequence of HF in both young and aged animals, but these are more pronounced in the aged, with some indices showing reduced HRV as a consequence of aging alone; and ( iv) following sequential autonomic blockade to assess the sympatho - vagal influence on the control of HR we found subtle age - dependent differences in HF, although before tachypacing commenced the intrinsic HR ( ie, during full autonomic blockade) was greater than the resting HR in young animals.

This increase may be partially mediated by binding of PER2 to PPARα, but lack of REV - ERBα abolishes binding of PER2 to the Fgf21 promoter of liver chromatin ( Fig. 3D ), suggesting a complex regulation of the Fgf21 promoter by PPARα and REV - ERBα with PER2 modulating the transcriptional potential of both of these nuclear receptors.

In the present study, we found that SCN1B mRNA / β1 protein were up - regulated in BCa specimens, compared with normal breast tissue. β1 upregulation substantially increased tumour growth and metastasis in a xenograft model of BCa. β1 over - expression also increased vascularization and reduced apoptosis in the primary tumours, and β1 over - expressing tumour cells had an elongate morphology. In vitro, β1 potentiated outgrowth of processes from BCa cells co - cultured with fibroblasts, via trans - homophilic adhesion. β1 - mediated process outgrowth in BCa cells required the presence and activity of fyn kinase, and Na + current, thus replicating the mechanism by which β1 regulates neurite outgrowth in CNS neurons.

VGSCs are widely expressed in cancers, and contribute to cellular behaviours associated with metastasis. 18, 19 In BCa, the predominant α subunit, Nav1. 5 ( gene: SCN5A ), is expressed in MDA - MB - 231 cells, where Na + current potentiates invasion by enhancing cysteine cathepsin activity. 20 – 22 SCN5A is up - regulated in tumours, associating with recurrence, metastasis and reduced survival. 20, 23 β1 is the predominant β subunit in MCF - 7 cells, where it enhances cell - substrate adhesion, but slows transwell migration. 24 Over - expression of β1 in MDA - MB - 231 cells increases cell - cell adhesion and Na + current. 24 Both α and β1 subunits are expressed in lamellipodia of MCF - 7 and MDA - MB - 231 cells, suggesting that their expression and function are not mutually exclusive. 23 Thus, VGSC α and β subunits appear to play complex, dynamic roles in metastatic BCa cells.

Various paracrine and autocrine factors are involved in pathogenesis and regulation of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, including angiotensin II ( AngII ), a key player of the renin – angiotensin system that induces cell hypertrophy, differentiation and apoptosis through activation of various intracellular signalling molecules including Gq protein, calcineurin, mitogen - activated protein kinases ( MAPK) and several transcription factors 8.

Avian haemosporidians are single - celled, intracellular parasites in which the fertilisation, formation of zygotes, and asexual sporogony take place in a blood - sucking dipteran vector while sexual gametogony and asexual merogony occur in the avian host [ 24 ]. Plasmodium haemosporidians are usually transmitted by dipteran vectors belonging to the Culicidae, while Haemoproteus are transmitted by dipterans of the Ceratopogonidae and Hippoboscidae, and Leucocytozoon through species belonging to the Simuliidae [ 24 ].

Recent evidence has shown that CCA, another form of primary liver cancer, is dependent on the Wnt pathway despite the lack of CTNNB1 mutations in malignant cholangiocytes. 27 35 – 37 In order to understand if our findings were disease - specific or could be extended also to CCA, we looked at uc. 158 − expression in an initial cohort of British human intrahepatic CCAs ( ICC) and found that uc. 158 − was significantly overexpressed in tumour tissues compared with healthy livers ( figure 5A ).
