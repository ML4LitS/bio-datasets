Here, Müller et al. show that ARTUMES regulates pollen tube recognition between different Arabidopsis species, representing the first gene known to exclusively influence inter - but not intraspecific gamete interaction in plants.

These results are consistent with the previously reported ER - localization of ARU - GFP in infiltrated tobacco leaves24.

Functional complementation of the aru - 1 mutant was also observed when ARU was driven by the endogenous promoter in a construct also containing 865 bp downstream sequence ( pARU :: ARU ), although there was more line - to - line variability than when the pMYB98 promoter was used ( Supplementary Fig. 7 ).

In addition, post - transcriptional regulation of gene expression could play a role in mediating ARU protein levels. ARU has a 410 bp long 3 ′- UTR ( 3 ′- untranslated region) 37 containing 17 SNPs that are correlated with the OG / S phenotype and might contribute to accession - specific differences in ARU protein levels.

To further investigate the role of ARU in different accessions, we transformed high OG / S accessions ( Fei - 0, Kz - 1, Kz - 9) with pMYB98 :: ARU - GFP to ensure strong expression in synergid cells and assessed interspecific PT reception in these lines.

Similarly, the ARU allele ( including 1, 492 bp up - and 865 bp downstream sequence) from Ga - 0 could not better complement the aru mutant — which is in the Col - 0 background — than the Col - 0 allele, as it would be expected if differences in ARU alone caused the phenotypic difference between Ga - 0 and Col - 0 ( Supplementary Fig. 7 ).

This is consistent with the lack of variation in ARU amino acid sequence and expression level but is difficult, although not impossible, to reconcile with the fact that we identified ARU in a GWAS for variation in the OG / S phenotype.

A previous report revealed that HDAC2, a histone modifier gene, affected spine number in hippocampus and regulated the formation of neural circuits. 31 These findings prompted us to hypothesize that JMJD2B was associated with synaptic development.

More recently, Zhang and colleagues reported that the protein kinase IK2, initially termed UIS1 [ 4 ], controls global gene expression in sporozoites at a post - transcriptional level [ 12 ].

Whether DOZI plays a role in sporozoites is not known, but other RNA - binding proteins may participate in translational regulation in sporozoites, including members of the Puf - family.

Targeted gene disruption in P. falciparum recently revealed a role of PfPuf2 in repressing gametocytogenesis and male gametocyte differentiation in the human malaria parasite [ 22 ].

Furthermore, Puf1 was also upregulated in gametocytes and ookinetes, similarly to IK2 and DOZI.	"Puf1	13	17	Gene/Protein"	"IK2	82	85	Gene/Protein"	"DOZI	90	94	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Puf1"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""IK2"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""DOZI"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In contrast to Puf1 and Puf2, DOZI steady state mRNA levels were down - regulated in infectious salivary gland - associated sporozoites resulting in ∼ 100 fold lower levels in the latent transmission stage.

In order to investigate the functional importance of Puf1 / UIS9 and Puf2 in P. berghei, we generated loss - of - function mutants ( Figure 2 ).	"Puf1	53	57	Gene/Protein"	"UIS9	60	64	Gene/Protein"	"Puf2	69	73	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Puf1"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""UIS9"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""Puf2"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
This indicates that Puf1 and Puf2 do not play any vital role during P. berghei erythrocytic stages, in good agreement with successful generation of Pfpuf2 (-) parasites [ 22 ].

puf1 (-) and puf2 (-) parasites produce gametocytes that develop to sporozoites in mosquitoes	"puf1	0	4	Gene/Protein"	"puf2	13	17	Gene/Protein"	"mosquitoes	83	93	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""puf1"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""puf2"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""mosquitoes"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We then analysed the infectivity of puf1 (-) and puf2 (-) sporozoites to susceptible mice.	"puf1	36	40	Gene/Protein"	"puf2	49	53	Gene/Protein"	"mice	85	89	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""puf1"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""puf2"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
With both inoculation routes, all mice injected with puf1 (-) sporozoites developed a parasitemia, with no delay as compared to WT parasites ( Table 1 ).	"mice	34	38	Organism/Species"	"puf1	53	57	Gene/Protein"	"parasitemia	86	97	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""puf1"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""parasitemia"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
In contrast, only a fraction of the mice injected with puf2 (-) sporozoites developed a parasitemia, with a two - day delay as compared to WT, indicative of at least 100 - fold reduction of infectivity ( Table 1 ).	"mice	36	40	Organism/Species"	"puf2	55	59	Gene/Protein"	"parasitemia	88	99	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""puf2"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""parasitemia"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
As shown in Figure 4, the puf2 (-) liver loads were extremely reduced (∼ 500 fold) as compared to WT, confirming that infectivity of puf2 (-) sporozoites to C57BL / 6 mice is severely impaired.	"puf2	26	30	Gene/Protein"	"puf2	133	137	Gene/Protein"	"C57BL / 6 mice	157	171	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""puf2"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""puf2"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""C57BL / 6 mice"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 171, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Parasite loads were determined by RT - qPCR analysis of mouse livers ( n = 4 or 5 per group) harvested 42 hours after intravenous injection of 10, 000 WT, puf1 (-) or puf2 (-) sporozoites.	"mouse	56	61	Organism/Species"	"puf1	155	159	Gene/Protein"	"puf2	167	171	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""puf1"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 159, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""puf2"", ""start_span"": 167, ""end_span"": 171, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Both puf1 (-) and puf2 (-) sporozoites entered hepatoma cells as efficiently as WT, as evidenced by similar numbers of infected cells at early time points ( 4 – 6 hours) ( Figure 5A ).	"puf1	5	9	Gene/Protein"	"puf2	18	22	Gene/Protein"	"hepatoma	47	55	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""puf1"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""puf2"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""hepatoma"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Nevertheless, most puf2 (-) sporozoites that formed a PV and expressed UIS4 were capable of developing into EEFs like WT and puf1 (-) parasites ( Figure 5C ).	"puf2	19	23	Gene/Protein"	"UIS4	71	75	Gene/Protein"	"puf1	125	129	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""puf2"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""UIS4"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""puf1"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Similarly to puf2 (-) parasites, ik2 (-) sporozoites transform prematurely in the mosquito salivary glands and have a decreased infectivity in vivo but not in vitro [ 12 ].	"puf2	13	17	Gene/Protein"	"ik2	33	36	Gene/Protein"	"mosquito	82	90	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""puf2"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""ik2"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""mosquito"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Therefore, we sought to test expression of IK2 in puf2 (-) sporozoites, in comparison to WT and puf1 (-) sporozoites, using RT - qPCR.	"IK2	43	46	Gene/Protein"	"puf2	50	54	Gene/Protein"	"puf1	96	100	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IK2"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""puf2"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""puf1"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The Puf domain of DmPUM binds to a nanos response element ( NRE) sequence located in the 3 ′ UTR of hb mRNA.	"Puf	4	7	Gene/Protein"	"DmPUM	18	23	Gene/Protein"	"hb	100	102	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Puf"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""DmPUM"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""hb"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In sporozoites, Puf2 regulates at least two other genes in addition to IK2 and Puf1.	"Puf2	16	20	Gene/Protein"	"IK2	71	74	Gene/Protein"	"Puf1	79	83	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Puf2"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""IK2"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""Puf1"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Reduced expression of Spect and Spect2 genes, which are both essential for sporozoite cell traversal and migration to the liver [ 29 ], [ 39 ], [ 40 ], may also contribute to the loss of infectivity of puf2 (-) parasites in vivo.	"Spect	22	27	Gene/Protein"	"Spect2	32	38	Gene/Protein"	"puf2	202	206	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Spect"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""Spect2"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""puf2"", ""start_span"": 202, ""end_span"": 206, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Alternatively, depletion of IK2 mRNA in puf2 (-) could be an indirect effect due to activation of an upstream factor that regulates IK2.	"IK2	28	31	Gene/Protein"	"puf2	40	44	Gene/Protein"	"IK2	132	135	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IK2"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""puf2"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""IK2"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Whereas Drosophila encodes only DmPUM, many organisms, including C. elegans, contain two or more genes encoding Puf proteins, which can fulfil partly redundant functions [ 41 ].	"Drosophila	8	18	Organism/Species"	"DmPUM	32	37	Gene/Protein"	"Puf	112	115	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""DmPUM"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""Puf"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
However, our molecular genetics data clearly exclude a vital role for Puf1 under normal conditions throughout the P. berghei life cycle. Puf1 may be critical under specific conditions, similarly to the role of IK1 in P. falciparum during starvation - induced stress [ 13 ].	"Puf1	70	74	Gene/Protein"	"Puf1	137	141	Gene/Protein"	"IK1	210	213	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Puf1"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""Puf1"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""IK1"", ""start_span"": 210, ""end_span"": 213, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Puf2 might compensate for the absence of Puf1 in puf1 (-) parasites, but not vice versa.

Because of the published data from P. falciparum puf2 (-) parasites we did not investigate sexual development and differentiation of Pbpuf2 (-) parasites in great detail other than to confirm the previous findings, i. e. an increase in gametocytogenesis in puf2 (-) parasites, partly due to increased male gametocyte differentiation.

In addition, FOS reduces the cytokine response of rat primary monocytes to P. aeruginosa infection, an effect considered indirect since this oligosaccharide was found to activate the NF - κB pathway.

To this end bacteria were grown in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0. 2% ( w / v) glucose, 0. 4% ( wt / v) casamino acids and with inulin or FOS.

The activation of macrophages is based largely on the recognition of pathogens by molecular pattern receptors, including Toll - like receptors ( TLRs ), such as TLR4 [ 16 ], [ 42 ].

Therefore, these experimental conditions were used to quantify the effect of FOS / inulin on the secretion of IL - 6, IL - 10 and TNF - α.

In the absence of bacteria ( Fig. 4, column – PAO1 ), inulin and FOS had no significant effect on cytokine secretion, although a slight increase was noted.

Macrophages were incubated with WT P. aeruginosa cells ( ratio 1 / 5) for 4 hours in either the absence or the presence of 5 mg / ml FOS and inulin prior to the determination of IL - 6 ( A ), IL - 10 ( B) and TNF - α secretion ( C ).

B) NF - κB activation was determined by measuring the nuclear translocation of the p65 component, expressed as the OD450 nm. * P < 0. 05 vs macrophage without bacteria and & P < 0. 05 vs WT in the absence of inulin or FOS ( ANOVA followed by least significance tests ).

Mutation of ptxS increases toxA expression by a factor of ∼ 4, whereas deletion of ptxR causes a ∼ 2 - fold reduction [ 51 ].

The increase in toxicity of the ptxS mutant ( Fig. 6A) is reflected in the colour of bacterial cultures due to the increased production of the bright blue - green siderophore pyocyanin, an important virulence factor of fluorescent Pseudomonads [ 52 ]–[ 54 ].

As expected, the cytokine secretory response followed the same pattern, being higher with the ptxS mutant, followed by the wild type and lower for the ptxR mutant ( Fig. 7) ( Data from Fig. 4 are included for comparison) [ 51 ].

Macrophages were incubated with WT and mutant P. aeruginosa cells ( ratio 1 / 5) for 4 hours in either the absence or the presence of 5 mg / ml FOS and inulin prior to the determination of IL - 6 ( A ), IL - 10 ( B) and TNF - α secretion ( C ).

Because we cannot rule out the presence of extracellular, cell adherent bacteria in the sample, it may be possible that FOS also downregulates exotoxin A in extracellular Pseudomonas.

Another proposed mechanism involves enhanced bacteriocin secretion by lactobacilli [ 59 ], which in turn facilitates the incorporation of bacteria into a niche and inhibits the invasion of competing strains or pathogens, leading ultimately to a modulation of the microbiota and of the host immune system.	"bacteriocin	45	56	Gene/Protein"	"lactobacilli	70	82	Organism/Species"	"bacteria	138	146	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""bacteriocin"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""lactobacilli"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""bacteria"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
We were able to show that FOS ( 1) inhibits P. aeruginosa growth, biofilm formation and motility; ( 2) limits the P. aeruginosa evoked NF - κB dependent cytokine secretion in macrophages; and ( 3) decreases exotoxin A levels in P. aeruginosa infected IEC18 cells.	"NF - κB	135	142	Gene/Protein"	"cytokine	153	161	Gene/Protein"	"exotoxin A	207	217	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NF - \u03baB"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""cytokine"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""exotoxin A"", ""start_span"": 207, ""end_span"": 217, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In order to test this hypothesis, we infected rat primary monocyte cultures with PAO1 and measured cytokine release in the presence and absence of oligosaccharides.

In the absence of bacteria neither FOS nor inulin caused an effect on cytokine secretion and their long - term effect on macrophages ( and intestinal epithelial cells) is an activation of the NF - κB pathway [ 65] and thus contrary to the oligosaccharide reduction of pathway activity.	"bacteria	18	26	Organism/Species"	"cytokine	70	78	Gene/Protein"	"NF - κB	192	199	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bacteria"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""cytokine"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""NF - \u03baB"", ""start_span"": 192, ""end_span"": 199, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
This may also explain why inulin failed to inhibit IκB - α phosphorylation, since it is also capable of activating this signalling pathway; however, it is unclear why inulin decreases IL - 6 and IL - 10 secretion.

We then investigated potential links between FOS and other determinants of P. aeruginosa virulence, such as the PtxS and PtxR regulators that modulate exotoxin A expression ( Fig. 6B ).

Oral FOS supplements are currently been used to prevent gastrointestinal infections [ 67 ], which implies that the oral route may be also valid to administer FOS to fight Pseudomonas infection.

In all cell lines examined, reduction of endogenous STAT3 expression levels by siRNA or treatment with the STAT3 inhibitor FLLL32 resulted in a decrease in cell growth as compared with untreated cells ( Fig. 6B, D – G) in a similar manner as crizotinib decreased cell growth ( Fig. 6A ).

One of the major tyrosine - phosphorylated proteins identified in this study was STAT3, which was phosphorylated on Tyr705 in response to ALK activation.

The crystal structures of ALK show that unphosphorylated Tyr1278 interacts with Cys1097 in the N - lobe of the kinase, implying that phosphorylation of Tyr1278 should make a binding site for STAT3 available, consistent with this hypothesis.

This hypothesis is supported by inhibition of the NB1 neuroblastoma cells lines with crizotinib, which resulted in a loss of pSTAT3Y705, although the significance of STAT3 for cell growth was not discussed 54.

Given these reports, our finding here that STAT3 is important for changes in MYCN levels in response to ALK signaling is significant.

The symptoms such as reduced activity, decreased exploratory behavior, and reduced sucrose preference appear in stressed animals, which are similar to the changes of behavior and the loss of interest or pleasure in the clinical diagnosis of depression [ 17 ].

Hyperactivity of HPA axis often occurs in both depressed patients and animal models, which is mainly presented as hypersecreted CRH and higher contents of ACTH and GC [ 24, 25 ].

Our experimental results showed that the 5 - HT and DA contents significantly decreased, while the NE content and the ratio of 5 - HIAA / 5 - HT significantly increased in hippocampus in rats, accompanied by the depressive - like behavioral alterations, which confirm that the dysfunction of monoamine neurotransmitters plays an important role in the pathogenesis of depression.

Amino acid neurotransmitters can be divided into two types of excitatory amino acid and inhibitory amino acid; the former includes Glu and Asp, while GABA and Tau belong to the latter.

In the present study, we found that the contents of Glu and Asp significantly increased, while the GABA and Tau contents decreased in hippocampus in depressed rats; it is suggested that CUMS could lead to the imbalance of excitatory / inhibitory amino acids in the brain, which may account for the mechanism underlying the behavioral changes in rats.

In the rat and other mammalian species, including human beings, HPA axis and neurotransmitters system are closely interacted in central nervous system ( CNS) ( particularly in hippocampus) and greatly involved in stress related disorder [ 38, 39 ].

Moreover, high concentration of GC can make 5 - HT transporter ( 5 - HTT) expression increase in hippocampus, amygdala, dorsal raphe nucleus, and other brain areas by GR dependent manner.

GABA could inhibit the releasing of ACTH, CORT, and CRH in hypothalamus and reregulate the hyperactivity of HPA axis; Tau, as an inhibitory amino acid, has the synergistic action with GABA to exert the effect on inhibiting the activation of HPA axis [ 49, 50 ].

Whereas attenuated serum ammonia levels were observed in HFD. Veh than RC.

In RC, serum urea levels were mildly reduced in the NOB group at both day - and night - time ( ZT6 and 18) ( Fig. 7a ), whereas the urine urea levels showed the opposite trend, suggesting increased urine urea excretion by NOB ( Fig. 7b ).

For men, transactional sex in the past year was associated with ever experiencing emotional abuse and severity of emotional abuse, severity of physical abuse, and any sexual abuse, and severity of sexual abuse.	"men	4	7	Organism/Species"	"emotional abuse	82	97	Disease/Disorder"	"emotional abuse	114	129	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""men"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""emotional abuse"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""emotional abuse"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
For women the range of childhood abuse experienced was significantly associated with transactional sex, four or more main sexual partners, four or more causal sexual partners, experiencing IPV, non - partner sexual violence, not using a condom use at last sex and harmful alcohol use.	"women	4	9	Organism/Species"	"sexual violence	208	223	Disease/Disorder"	"alcohol	272	279	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""women"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""sexual violence"", ""start_span"": 208, ""end_span"": 223, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""alcohol"", ""start_span"": 272, ""end_span"": 279, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The overall severity of childhood trauma for women was associated with transactional sex, four or more casual partners in the past year, past year experience of IPV, non - partner sexual violence, and harmful alcohol use.

The analysis suggests that broadly for women and men, all forms of childhood traumas are associated with current HIV - risk behaviours.	"women	39	44	Organism/Species"	"men	49	52	Organism/Species"	"HIV	113	116	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""women"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""men"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This reflects a growing body of global research that also outlines the close relationship between childhood trauma and HIV - vulnerability for women and men [ 4 – 6, 28 ].	"HIV	119	122	Organism/Species"	"women	143	148	Organism/Species"	"men	153	156	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""women"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""men"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
For women and men sexual abuse was independently associated with all HIV - risk behaviours ( apart from condom use ), reflecting the fact that sexual abuse seems to be a major driver of long - term health impact.	"women	4	9	Organism/Species"	"men	14	17	Organism/Species"	"HIV	69	72	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""women"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""men"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
For women, the number of past year sex partners tended not to be as strongly associated with physical or emotional abuse, or the range or overall severity of childhood trauma, but this was not the case with men.	"women	4	9	Organism/Species"	"emotional abuse	105	120	Disease/Disorder"	"men	207	210	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""women"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""emotional abuse"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""men"", ""start_span"": 207, ""end_span"": 210, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
There is research in South Africa showing that boys and young men experience sexual abuse by women as well as men [ 26, 35 ].

The analysis highlights the importance of reducing all forms of childhood traumas as a way to reduce subsequent HIV - risk amongst young women and men.	"HIV	112	115	Organism/Species"	"women	137	142	Organism/Species"	"men	147	150	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""HIV"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""women"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""men"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Additionally, there were incredibly consistent findings across women and men, whereby childhood traumas, assessed in a wide variety of ways were consistently associated with a range of HIV - risk behaviours.

VZV reactivation is primarily related to an age - related decline in VZV - specific immunity; it is well documented that the incidence of HZ increases with age, with the majority of cases occurring in patients over 50 years of age [ 4 ].

PHN is a neuropathic syndrome manifesting as on - going pain along the nerves in the area of the prior HZ rash and typically involves one or more of the following: spontaneous aching or burning; paroxysmal shooting pains; allodynia, and hyperalgesia [ 9, 10 ].

There is no consensus regarding the definition of PHN; however, PHN is often defined as pain persisting for 90 days from HZ rash onset [ 4, 6, 10, 11 ].

While HZ is an acute experience that typically resolves within one month, in the majority of sufferers, PHN persists for at least 6 months with some patients experiencing PHN for years [ 12 - 15 ].

Reflecting the chronic nature of PHN, higher rates of medical visits ( GP and specialist visits) have been reported in PHN patients compared to HZ patients [ 14, 21, 27, 29, 50 ].

Rates of hospitalisation and duration of stay were found to be higher for PHN than for HZ, and to increase with increasing age, translating into higher inpatient costs for patients that develop PHN ( Table 4) [ 18, 24, 33, 70 ].

3 - HK ( μM, Row 9) was detected in plasma of all mice, although near the lower limit of detection in KMO −/− mice.

XA has been reported to influence synaptic transmission as a metabotropic glutamate receptor group II ligand and a vesicular glutamate transporter inhibitor. 36, 37 In the ventral hippocampus, LPS treatment also increased kynurenine and XA.

Direct administration of 3 - HK, the metabolic product of KMO, induced the development of depressive - like behaviors that were attenuated in the KMO −/− mice ( Figure 4 ).

Therefore, LPS - induced depressive behavior was measured in HAAO −/− mice, and these mice were also protected from the development of the same specific depressive - like behaviors ( Figure 5 ).

Indeed, Frenois et al. 38 demonstrated that neuronal activation following peripheral LPS challenge of C57BL6 / J mice ( measured by FosB / Δ FosB immunohistochemistry) was not uniformly increased. 38 Rather, discrete regions with known relevance to depressive behavioral domains were more strongly increased, including hippocampus, nucleus accumbens and central amygdala. 38	"mice	113	117	Organism/Species"	"FosB	132	136	Gene/Protein"	"FosB	141	145	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""FosB"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""FosB"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Whereas a previous report by Giorgini et al. 39 characterized the metabolic changes that occur in response to a KMO deficiency in a separate strain of mice, 39 the data in Figure 3 are the first to demonstrate the significance of a KMO genetic deletion on the behavioral consequences of peripheral LPS administration.

This is seemingly in contrast to previous data from our laboratory, and others demonstrating that direct administration of kynurenine can induce deficits in novel object recognition and spatial working memory alter fear conditioning and induce anhedonia. 16, 33, 40, 41, 42 It is possible that the accumulation of kynurenine over time through development allows the system to adjust preventing any potential behavioral changes.

Although QA was not reliably detected in any brain tissue sample, both central 3 - HK and 3 - HAA in HAAO −/− mice were increased over WT levels, as would be predicted in mice lacking the enzyme to metabolize 3 - HAA to QA.

Previous data in mice with either genetic or systemic inhibition of IDO clearly indicate a pivotal role for kynurenine metabolism in mediating depressive - like behaviors in response to peripheral immune challenge.

Whereas the previous study by Walker et al. 20 found that both LPS - induced increases in immobility and reduction in SP could be mitigated by the NMDAR antagonist, ketamine, a direct pathogenic role for QA action on NMDARs can only be speculated. 20 Here, we provide the first direct evidence that a shift toward neurotoxic metabolism in the hippocampus mediates the behavioral deficits following peripheral LPS.

This discrepancy could be the result of strain - related differences in LPS - induced metabolism of CD - 1 versus C57BL6 / J mice, or more likely other neuroactive kynurenines are responsible for driving the LPS - induced anhedonia phenotype, such as XA or KA.

Our data indicate that hippocampal - dependent behaviors may be particularly vulnerable to neurotoxic dysregulation of kynurenine metabolism, which could also have larger implications in the context of neurodegenerative disease and chronic inflammatory conditions.

To assess the clinical significance of ccfDNA levels, we analyzed the clinicopathological correlations in the total lymphoma group but restricted the analysis to patients with DLBCL; in this patient subset, the adverse prognostic factors advanced stage disease ( stage IIB – IV) and elevated LDH levels were associated with increased ccfDNA levels and DII ( Table 2 ).

Hohaus et al.

Regarding the clinical correlation of ccfDNA levels in lymphoma patients, we observed an association between the ccfDNA levels and a number of clinical parameters that indicate a worse prognosis such as advanced stage disease, the presence of B - symptoms, elevated LDH levels, and high IPI score; these correlations suggest that both the ccfDNA concentration and the DII might reflect actively proliferating disease and lymphoma burden.

An association between a high concentration of ccfDNA and poor prognosis may be linked to tumor burden [ 27 ]; however, changes in the total ccfDNA concentration may reflect not only changes in circulating tumor DNA ( ctDNA) but also in other conditions that may lead to an increase in ccfDNA, including infection or chemotherapy drug - induced release of normal ccfDNA into the circulation.

By the end of the 19th century, there were only two populations of wisent left in the wild that were assigned to separate subspecies: in Białowieża Forest ( Lowland wisent, B. b. bonasus) and in the western Caucasus Mountains ( Caucasian wisent, B. b. caucasicus ).

Slightly increased divergence is observed between the modern LC line individual ( MdLC) and all modern and founding wisent ( fig. 2A ), which may reflect the increased component of Caucasian wisent ancestry in this individual resulting from the captive breeding program.

We found a significant excess of derived allele sharing between one founding wisent, PLANTA, and one Caucasian wisent, Cc2, relative to the other founding wisent, her son PLATEN ( fig. 5B ).

Through the use of low - coverage genomic data from modern and historical wisent, including from the now extinct Caucasian wisent subspecies, we have revealed the complexity of wisent evolution.	"wisent	74	80	Organism/Species"	"Caucasian wisent	113	129	Organism/Species"	"wisent	177	183	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Caucasian wisent"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 183, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The accepted view of wisent evolution is of two distinct subspecies, Lowland wisent and Caucasian wisent, that both underwent dramatic population declines, with the last few surviving individuals serving as founders of the modern L ( Lowland only) and LC ( Lowland and Caucasian) lines ( Pucek et al.	"wisent	21	27	Organism/Species"	"Lowland wisent	69	83	Organism/Species"	"Caucasian wisent	88	104	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Lowland wisent"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Caucasian wisent"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Although the individual from this population ( modern L line, MdL2) that we sequenced does not possess this putative Caucasian wisent allele, we nevertheless detected evidence of Caucasian wisent admixture above that occurring in founding wisent for this individual ( fig. 5 ).	"Caucasian wisent	117	133	Organism/Species"	"Caucasian wisent	179	195	Organism/Species"	"wisent	239	245	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Caucasian wisent"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Caucasian wisent"", ""start_span"": 179, ""end_span"": 195, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 239, ""end_span"": 245, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
However, the small size of admixed blocks, in addition to non - significant D comparisons of modern lines, supports variable Caucasian wisent admixture among founding wisent in explaining this result, which may also account for the occurrence of putative Caucasian wisent alleles in other individuals from this population.	"Caucasian wisent	125	141	Organism/Species"	"wisent	167	173	Organism/Species"	"Caucasian wisent	255	271	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Caucasian wisent"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 167, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Caucasian wisent"", ""start_span"": 255, ""end_span"": 271, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Our results further support this finding using measures of pairwise genomic divergences among modern and founding wisent, which are approximately equal to or greater than that found between pairs of cattle or yak, respectively.	"wisent	114	120	Organism/Species"	"cattle	199	205	Organism/Species"	"yak	209	212	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""cattle"", ""start_span"": 199, ""end_span"": 205, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""yak"", ""start_span"": 209, ""end_span"": 212, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Previous studies have found evidence of admixture with the Bos cattle lineage in modern L line wisent ( Gautier et al.	"Bos	59	62	Organism/Species"	"cattle	63	69	Organism/Species"	"wisent	95	101	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""Bos"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""cattle"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
However, the precise identity of the introgressor — aurochs or domestic cattle — is less certain, given the lack of knowledge of population structure in aurochs.	"aurochs	52	59	Organism/Species"	"domestic cattle	63	78	Organism/Species"	"aurochs	153	160	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""aurochs"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""domestic cattle"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""aurochs"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 160, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
The small size of cattle admixed blocks in modern wisent ( at least undetectable at a 1 Mb scale) clearly rejects very recent cattle admixture for the individuals investigated here.	"cattle	18	24	Organism/Species"	"wisent	50	56	Organism/Species"	"cattle	126	132	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""cattle"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""cattle"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
Using seven low - coverage wisent genomes from both modern and historical wisent we have revealed multiple instances of admixture, but moreover, because the approximate age of introgression of Caucasian wisent into the modern LC line is known, through comparisons of the sizes of likely admixed genomic segments we have inferred the relative ages of other admixture events.

The results of uptake and kinetic studies led us to conclude that both GmPT1 and GmPT2 probably have a low affinity for Pi at millimolar concentrations, similar to the endogenous yeast low - affinity Pi uptake system.

The low concentration of Pi commonly found in the soil solution [ 8] has led to the hypothesis that only high - affinity Pi transporters can function for the uptake of Pi across the plasma membrane of root epidermal cells, whereas the low - affinity Pi transporters could be responsible for transport of Pi within the plant [ 20 ].

Knock - down of OsPT2 transgenic line r2 - 1 have shown that the concentration of Pi in the shoot is much lower than that of the wild type [ 21 ]; therefore, OsPT2 is responsible for translocation of the stored Pi in the plant.

In this work, we have used the catalytic domain sequences to construct a phylogenetic tree for the DGK family members from representatives of the main vertebrate classes and have also examined the distributions of various DGK isozymes in eukaryotic phyla.

The unique domains present in DGK isozymes, through their interactions with various regulatory proteins and other molecules present in different cells and tissues, play key roles in the diverse physiological functions exhibited by different DGK isozymes [ 1 – 6 ].

Although the differences in the structural characteristics of DGK isozymes and their involvement in diverse cellular functions are widely known [ 1 – 6 ], there is limited ( or no) information available at present as to how different DGK isozymes, or the different classes of DGKs, are related to each other, and have possibly evolved from a common ancestor.

Based on sequence alignments of DGK homologs from representatives of different groups of vertebrates, conserved regions from the catalytic domain which could be properly aligned amongst different DGK classes were identified and these were subjected to phylogenetic analyses.	"DGK	32	35	Gene/Protein"	"vertebrates	89	100	Organism/Species"	"DGK	196	199	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DGK"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""vertebrates"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""DGK"", ""start_span"": 196, ""end_span"": 199, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Within the class I isozymes, the DGK - α homologs formed outgroups relative to a cluster consisting of the DGK - β and DGK - γ homologs, indicating that the sequences from the latter two groups are more closely related.	"DGK - α	33	40	Gene/Protein"	"DGK - β	107	114	Gene/Protein"	"DGK - γ	119	126	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DGK - \u03b1"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""DGK - \u03b2"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""DGK - \u03b3"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Similarly, within the class II isozymes, a grouping of DGK - δ and DGK - η homologs was supported by the observed bootstrap score, with the DGK - κ sequences forming an outgroup of this cluster.	"DGK - δ	55	62	Gene/Protein"	"DGK - η	67	74	Gene/Protein"	"DGK - κ	140	147	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DGK - \u03b4"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""DGK - \u03b7"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""DGK - \u03ba"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 147, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
However, due to the uniqueness of the DGK catalytic domain sequence for the eukaryotic homologs, no suitable outgroup is available for determining the ancestral state of the protein or reliably inferring whether a given CSI represents an insertion within a certain class of DGK homologs or a deletion in the rest of the DGK homologs.

For DGK - α and DGK - γ, interesting differences are also seen in the length of this CSI amongst the vertebrate species.

Although, the CSIs ❹ and ❺ are placed in different positions in Fig 5, due to limited sequence similarity observed for the DGK - θ homologs in the vicinity of this indel, it is possible that the indel in DGK - θ ( marked as Sig ❺) also occurred in the same position as in the Class I and Class IV DGK isozymes.

One of these CSIs, a 2 aa insert, is specific for the DGK - ε homologs ( marked as Sig ❾ ), whereas in a nearby region, both DGK - θ as well as DGK - ε are found to contain CSIs of different lengths in the same position ( marked as Sig ❿A, B ).

However, the sequence of the ATP binding motif ( G - X - G - X - X - G) is nearly perfectly conserved in all DGK - isozymes in vertebrates, with the exception of DGK - κ isoform, where a Ser is present in place of the last Gly residue in the mammalian homologs.

Based on these observations, it can be hypothesized ( predicted) that the CSIs in the CD that are specific for different classes of DGK homologs should also be playing important roles in the interactions of different DGK isozymes with specific proteins ( or other target molecules) that may be responsible for the differences in the cellular functions of the different DGK isozymes.

It should also be noted that apart from the CSIs that are specific for different classes of DGKs, sequence alignments shown in Figs 2 – 7 and S1 Fig also contain large numbers of specific amino acid substitutions ( or polymorphisms) that are specific for particular classes of DGK homologs.

The bacterial DGK homologs are short in comparison to the eukaryotic proteins and they do not contain any of the canonical sequence features ( viz. catalytic domain and cysteine - rich C1 domains ), which are shared characteristics of all eukaryotic DGK homologs [ 2, 4, 5, 12, 59 ].

These observations strongly suggest that the bacterial DGK homologs are evolutionarily unrelated to the eukaryotic counterparts, and that the proteins exhibiting DGK activity have evolved independently in bacteria.

Although the present work does not resolve how different classes of DGK proteins have originated from a common ancestor and which of these isoforms is most ancestral, the results presented here show that of the different classes of DGKs, the DGK - ε, - θ and - ζ isoforms are most widely distributed in eukaryotic organisms.

Further, DGK - ε is the only isoform which shows specificity for a particular substrate i. e. arachidonoyl - containing diacylglycerol [ 2, 3, 6, 12, 62 ].

Moreover, these effects were maintained in vivo in adult animals as sensory and motor axonal regeneration as well as functional recovery was enhanced after treating nerve injuries with a nerve conduit prefilled with the same combinations of NTFs and ECM components.

In cultures of SC slices ( Figure 1 ), addition of FN to the matrix doubled the maximum neurite length whereas addition of LM did not increase it compared to the control COL matrix ( Figure 1J ).

Addition of BDNF but not of NGF / NT3 to the different substrates enhanced neurite length.

On the other hand, LM or NGF / NT3 alone or combined did not show any improvement ( Figure 1J – L ).

However, more regenerated sensory neurons were counted in the LM + MP. NGF / NT3 group compared to the other four groups ( Figure 3J ).

The faster muscle reinnervation found in group FN + MP. BDNF is of relevance considering the longer distance that has to be regenerated in injured human nerves.

At later time points, all groups showed positive responses, being LM + MP. NGF / NT3 the only group with significantly higher scores compared to the control group ( p < 0. 05; Figure 4C ).	"LM	66	68	Gene/Protein"	"NGF	75	78	Gene/Protein"	"NT3	81	84	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LM"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""NGF"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""NT3"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Group LM + MP. NGF / NT3 had significantly higher number of IENF than all the other groups ( Figure 4K ).	"LM	6	8	Gene/Protein"	"NGF	15	18	Gene/Protein"	"NT3	21	24	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LM"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""NGF"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""NT3"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Taken together, these results indicate that the combination of LM and NGF / NT3 enhances sensory axons regeneration and skin reinnervation by populations of sensory neurons that contribute to thermal and mechanical sensibility, and less markedly of sympathetic fibers innervating the SGs.	"LM	63	65	Gene/Protein"	"NGF	70	73	Gene/Protein"	"NT3	76	79	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LM"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""NGF"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""NT3"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Taking into account that some NTFs show an attractive or repulsive effect depending on the presence of different ECM molecules [ 33 ], we performed a screening of possible combinations added to a collagen gel substrate to investigate if the preferential effects of ECM components and NTFs could be synergistically added in DRG and SC postnatal cultures.

We observed an increased effect of LM and NGF + NT3 on sensory neurite outgrowth in DRG explants, whereas this combination did not increase motor neurite length.

On the other hand, NTFs may also modulate the expression of different integrin receptor subunits, whose upregulation is low in adult compared to their expression in early postnatal animals [ 38 ].

Since the optimal developmental window of regeneration varies from E11 – E15 in the chick spinal cord to P7 in rats [ 40] and the effects of different ECM molecules in vitro are lost when switching from postnatal P7 to weaned P21 rats [ 14 ], it was necessary to confirm in a model of peripheral nerve injury and regeneration in vivo the effects observed in cultures.

We can discard that this could be related to an inefficient supply of NTFs as we have previously shown that NTF encapsulation in MPs improved regeneration of both motor and sensory axons, and that PLGA MPs are able to sustain release of these NTFs longer than a month [ 21 ].

On the other hand, treatment with LM + MP. NGF / NT3 showed earlier sensory responses to both mechanical and thermal stimuli, confirming the results seen in the retrotracer study.

We also demonstrated an increased number of sensory axons reinnervating the epidermis and of sympathetic axons reinnervating the SGs in the skin in the LM + MP. NGF / NT3 group.

The identification of these transporters also have uncovered the mechanisms of extracellular accumulation of diverse organic acids in genome level, and provides new clues to orchestrate competition of extracellular accumulation between target and non - target carboxylates in yeast and other eukaryotic microorganisms.

In a tumor microenvironment, the MSCs are often constantly exposed to immune cells and inflammatory cytokines / chemokines.

To assess the possible effects of M1 macrophages on the MSCs in tumor growth, we treated MSCs with condition medium derived from M1 macrophages ( cMSCs ), characterized by their tumor - promoting activity and phenotype, and studied the mechanism of the cMSCs in affecting tumor growth in comparison to normal MSCs.

We found that M1 macrophages could activate the MSCs to adopt a regulatory phenotype, and the cMSCs promoted tumor growth by iNOS and MCP1.

We also checked the expression at the mRNA level of several M2 markers ( IL - 10, Arg - 1 and FIZZ - 1) in M1 macrophages, but in our conditions, we observed no significant expression of these genes.

When co - injected with MDA - MB - 231 - FLUC breast cancer cells, the cMSCs but not the untreated MSC remarkably increased the tumor - initiating ability and tumor growth ( Figure 1A, 1D ).

Similar to the breast cancer model, the cMSCs caused a tumor - promoting effect in the hepatocellular carcinoma model as compared to the untreated control MSCs group ( Figure 1B, 1E ).

Furthermore, after the cMSCs were co - injected with murine 4T1 - FLUC cells into a fat pad of normal mice, the cMSCs were more effective than the control MSCs in promoting tumor growth ( data not shown ).

( D) Representative flow cytometry data show the frequency of CD206 macrophages from the tumor and peripheral blood of 4T1 bearing control mice.

We found that the tumor promoting activity of the cMSCs was largely MCP1 dependent since it was significantly blocked by adding MCP1 siRNA ( Figure 4C ).	"tumor	18	23	Disease/Disorder"	"MCP1	68	72	Gene/Protein"	"MCP1	128	132	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""tumor"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""MCP1"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""MCP1"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Altogether, these data demonstrate that the cMSCs probably exert their tumor - promoting effect by recruiting macrophages to tumor sites through the production of MCP1.

When macrophages were further examined for their M1 / M2 gene expression profile by real - time PCR, we found that macrophages co - cultured with cMSCs expressed high levels of FIZZ - 1, MCP1 and SIRPα ( Figure 5A ), comprising an M2 - preferential gene signature in comparison to control macrophages.

The tumor - promoting abilities required iNOS and TAMs; TAMs were recruited by MCP1 and further polarized into an M2 - like phenotype to affect tumorigenesis.

M1 macrophages could activate the MSCs to adopt a regulatory phenotype, and the cMSCs promoted tumor growth by iNOS, MCP1 and induced macrophages toward M2 - like macrophages.

In addition to polarization of macrophages, the MSCs could also polarize into two distinctly acting phenotypes following specific TLR - activation including MSC1 and MSC2 [ 17, 22 ].
