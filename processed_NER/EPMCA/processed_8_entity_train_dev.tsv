However the putative MLL promoter has binding motifs for a large number of transcription factors, including SREBF1 ( sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor) and MYC. MYC is a pivotal player in the control of cell cycle and apoptosis [ 34 ], is one of the known downstream targets of GC signaling in lymphocytes [ 35 ], and has been reported to be up - regulated in MLL - disease [ 36 ].

Potential virulence properties of Campylobacter include motility, chemotaxis, colonization ability, adhesion to intestinal cells, invasion and epithelial translocation, intracellular survival, and formation of toxins and a number of putative virulence genes have been reported among the Campylobacter isolates [ 30 ]. CiaB gene and racR gene are highly prevalent in Campylobacter isolates from various sources [ 31 ], and conserved across the species [ 32 ].
