Previous research in this area has suffered from an overall lack of functional precision, as studies that measured kynurenine metabolism downstream of IDO have evaluated only CSF in patients or whole - brain tissue in rodents. 19, 20 For example, Raison et al. 19 showed that the concentration of QA in the CSF was positively correlated with depression scores of controls and subjects receiving interferon immunotherapy. 19 In addition, the first preclinical study to investigate the role of QA in driving depressive symptoms showed that LPS - induced depressive behaviors could be mitigated in inbred C57BL / 6 mice by the NMDAR, ketamine, suggesting a pathogenic role for QA. 20 Metabolic analysis in the study by Walker et al. 20 indicated that LPS caused a shift toward neurotoxic metabolism in whole - brain tissue of a separate group of CD - 1 outbred mice. 20 Here, we report, for we believe the first time, direct evidence that directly implicates KMO - dependent kynurenine metabolism in LPS - induced depression.
