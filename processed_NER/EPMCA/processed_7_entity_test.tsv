The complications they cause such as learning disorders, memory - formation deficits and epilepsy, have profound effects on patients ' daily life. 1, 2 Numerous gene mutations are involved in these pathologies, including genes associated with postsynaptic components. 3, 4 Moreover, recent studies provide increasing evidence of the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in the underlying pathobiology, 5 and mutations of genes involved in epigenetic regulation are found in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders. 6, 7 In addition, recent report suggests that several histone - modification genes, including both histone methyltransferases and demethylases, are causative risk genes for such disorders. 8 Nevertheless, our knowledge of the involvement of histone modifications in neurodevelopmental disorders is limited.

In this study, we confirmed that nicotine interfered with BMSC transplantation repair of cartilage defects by inhibiting Sox9 expression in vivo and that nicotine - induced Sox9 gene suppression via nAChRs is mediated directly by decreasing the histone acetylation of the Sox9 promoter.

Thus, we measured the phosphatase activity of calcineurin in 0. 5 h after nicotine stimulus and found that the enzyme activity of calcineurin was also increased in a concentration - dependent manner ( Fig. 3b ).

The results showed that the expression of Sox9 had no change when 10 μM MLA and Si - NFATc2 were given 0. 5 h before the nicotine exposure ( Fig. 4n and o ), implying that interventions aimed at α7 - nAChR and NFATc2 could reverse nicotine ’ s suppressive effect on the expression of Sox9.

Therefore, nicotine could activate Ca2 +/ Calcineurin / NFAT signaling in BMSCs throughα7 - nAChR, resulting in recruitment of HDAC1, which decreased histone acetylation of the Sox9 promoter region and finally inhibited BMSC chondrogenic differentiation.

In this study, we showed that nicotine at a dose under the actual exposure of nicotine dependence in daily life had an adverse effect on the chondrogenic repair of BMSCs in cartilage defects and that nicotine suppressed BMSC chondrogenic differentiation via the activation Ca2 +/ Calcineurin / NFATc2 signaling, which decreased the histone acetylation of the Sox9 promoter region.

In fact, it has been reported that the pro - regenerative effects of NGF and NT3 are reduced after blocking the α7 subunit of integrins in sensory neurons [ 36 ], and that synergistic actions between integrins and NTF receptors may be attributed to the sustained activation of Src and the downstream signaling Akt intermediate [ 37 ].
