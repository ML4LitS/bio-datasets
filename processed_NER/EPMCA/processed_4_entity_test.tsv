S100A9 ( MRP14) and S100A8 ( MRP8) constitute roughly 40% of the cytosolic protein in neutrophils; their pure abundance implies an important role in neutrophil functions.

Indeed, blocking TLR4 partially abrogated the S100A8 / 9 survival effect, suggesting that S100A8 / 9 is an endogenous TLR4 ligand mediating survival.

These results are in keeping with the aberrant neuronal morphology observed in JMJD2B mutant mice, as accumulating evidences indicate an association of memory function with alterations in dendritic spine morphology. 35 Therefore, impaired hippocampal spine maturation may cause working memory deficits in JMJD2B mutant mice.

One of these factors, the AP2 - Sp transcription factor, is required during sporozoite differentiation and binds to a specific DNA sequence found in the promoter region of many genes expressed in sporozoites, including, but not restricted to, UIS genes [ 8 ].

In female gametocytes, many transcripts encoding ookinete proteins are translationally repressed by a DEAD - box RNA helicase called DOZI, which binds to the 3 ′ untranslated region ( UTR) of target mRNAs such as P28 and blocks their translation until occurrence of gamete fertilization and differentiation into a zygote and ookinete [ 14 ], [ 15 ].

C57BL / 6 mice were injected intravenously with 1, 000 WT, puf1 (-) or puf2 (-) P. berghei sporozoites, or exposed to the bites of 10 infected mosquitoes, the natural transmission route ( Table 1 ).

We next injected C57BL / 6 mice intravenously with WT, puf1 (-) or puf2 (-) sporozoites isolated on day 18 from mosquito salivary glands.

The reduction of parasite liver loads as measured by RT - qPCR is consistent with the delay or absence of parasitemia in mice injected with puf2 (-) sporozoites ( Table 1 ), therefore we assume that the absence of Puf2 did not interfere with 18S rRNA quantification.

We also determined the In vitro infectivity of puf1 (-) and puf2 (-) sporozoites isolated on day 22 from mosquito salivary glands, in cultured HepG2 hepatoma cells ( Figure 5 ).

In puf2 (-)- infected mosquitoes, however, the proportion of transformed sporozoites increased over time during the course of infection in the mosquitoes, which are kept at 20 ° C ( Figure 6B ).

( B) The proportion of non - transformed, partially transformed and fully transformed sporozoites was determined by microscopic examination of sporozoites isolated from mosquito salivary glands 18, 21, 25 or 29 days after infection with WT, puf1 (-) or puf2 (-) parasites.

puf2 (-) sporozoites have reduced levels of Puf1 and UIS1 / IK2 mRNA	"puf2	0	4	Gene/Protein"	"Puf1	44	48	Gene/Protein"	"UIS1	53	57	Gene/Protein"	"IK2	60	63	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""puf2"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""Puf1"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""UIS1"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""IK2"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The phenotype of puf2 (-) parasites is essentially identical to that of parasites that contain a targeted deletion of the kinase UIS1 / IK2 [ 12 ].

As expected from gene deletion, no Puf1 and Puf2 mRNA were detected in puf1 (-) and puf2 (-) sporozoites, respectively ( Figure 7 ).	"Puf1	35	39	Gene/Protein"	"Puf2	44	48	Gene/Protein"	"puf1	71	75	Gene/Protein"	"puf2	84	88	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Puf1"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""Puf2"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""puf1"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""puf2"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
puf2 (-) sporozoites have reduced levels of Puf1 and UIS1 / IK2 mRNA.

Both puf2 (-) and ik2 (-) sporozoites transform prematurely in the mosquito and display greatly reduced infectivity to mice.

These observations, combined with a major down - regulation of IK2 expression in puf2 (-) sporozoites, suggest that the phenotype of Puf2 - deficient parasites can be explained, to a large extent, by IK2 depletion.	"IK2	63	66	Gene/Protein"	"puf2	81	85	Gene/Protein"	"Puf2	133	137	Gene/Protein"	"IK2	200	203	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IK2"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""puf2"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""Puf2"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""IK2"", ""start_span"": 200, ""end_span"": 203, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eIF2 by distinct kinases, such as Plasmodium IK2, is a central mechanism in stress - induced translational regulation [ 32 ], including in protozoans.

For example, the eIF2alpha kinase IK1 regulates responses to starvation stress in P. falciparum blood stages [ 13 ], and in Toxoplasma gondii, phosphorylation of eIF2alpha promotes survival of extracellular tachyzoites [ 33 ].

Our results are not compatible with a role of Puf2 in repressing IK2, because puf2 (-) and ik2 (-) share a similar phenotype.

Based on our results in the rodent malaria model system, we predict that P. falciparum sporozoites lacking Puf2 will present a similar phenotype, that is premature sporozoite transformation in the mosquito and decreased infectivity.

One of these, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3 ), has previously been observed to be activated in response to oncogenic ALK signaling, but the significance of this in signaling from the full - length ALK receptor has not been explored further.

However, ALK is also known to be mutated in the context of the full - length receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ), this being most clearly understood in neuroblastoma.

Today, crizotinib ( PF - 02341066) is in use as a Food and Drug Administration - approved drug for the treatment of ALK - positive NSCLC 12.

This list, which reflects both direct and indirect tyrosine phosphorylation targets as a result of ALK activity within the cell, verifies several recently published results such as fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2 ( FRS2) 23.

To highlight potential direct downstream substrates of full - length ALK, a network analysis using known protein – protein interactions and experimentally verified kinase – substrate relationships of the human orthologs of the identified phosphoproteins was performed ( Fig. 1B ).	"ALK	69	72	Gene/Protein"	"kinase	164	170	Gene/Protein"	"human	204	209	Organism/Species"	"phosphoproteins	238	253	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ALK"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""kinase"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 170, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 204, ""end_span"": 209, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""phosphoproteins"", ""start_span"": 238, ""end_span"": 253, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In agreement with a role for these proteins downstream of ALK, we detected approximately 10 - fold higher phosphorylation at Tyr546 and Tyr584 in SHP - 2 as well as Tyr705 in STAT3 under ALK - activating conditions in our model.	"ALK	58	61	Gene/Protein"	"SHP - 2	146	153	Gene/Protein"	"STAT3	175	180	Gene/Protein"	"ALK	187	190	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ALK"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""SHP - 2"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""STAT3"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 180, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""ALK"", ""start_span"": 187, ""end_span"": 190, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In both cases, tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 was abrogated by the addition of the ALK inhibitor crizotinib ( Fig. 2A, compare lanes 4 and 7 with lanes 5 and 8 ).	"tyrosine	15	23	Chemical/Drug"	"STAT3	43	48	Gene/Protein"	"ALK	86	89	Gene/Protein"	"crizotinib	100	110	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""tyrosine"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""STAT3"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""ALK"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""crizotinib"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Similarly, we were able to observe STAT3 in both wild - type and gain - of - function ALK immunoprecipitates from PC12 cells transiently expressing ALK and STAT3 ( Fig. 2C ).	"STAT3	35	40	Gene/Protein"	"ALK	86	89	Gene/Protein"	"ALK	148	151	Gene/Protein"	"STAT3	156	161	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""STAT3"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""ALK"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""ALK"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""STAT3"", ""start_span"": 156, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
As controls, we employed primers amplifying part of the coding sequence of ribosomal protein 29 ( RPL29) or ribosomal protein 19 ( RPL19) ( Fig. 5B, data not shown ).	"ribosomal protein 29	75	95	Gene/Protein"	"RPL29	98	103	Gene/Protein"	"ribosomal protein 19	108	128	Gene/Protein"	"RPL19	131	136	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ribosomal protein 29"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""RPL29"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""ribosomal protein 19"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""RPL19"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Thus, pharmacological inhibition of STAT3 activity in neuroblastoma cell lines harboring ALK gain - of - function mutations results in reduced transcription of MYCN mRNA.

Furthermore, it was clear that treatment of neuroblastoma cell lines with either FLLL32 or crizotinib reduced the phosphorylation status of STAT3 to a similar degree, without increasing cleavage of poly ( ADP - ribose) polymerase ( PARP ), which was used as a measure of apoptosis ( Fig. 6C ).

Another site commonly used to denote activation of the ALK receptor is Tyr1604, which is situated at the C - terminal tail of the receptor, and has been reported to be important for transformation activity and docking of phospholipase Cγ in studies on NPM – ALK 47.	"ALK receptor	55	67	Gene/Protein"	"phospholipase Cγ	221	237	Gene/Protein"	"NPM	252	255	Gene/Protein"	"ALK	258	261	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ALK receptor"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""phospholipase C\u03b3"", ""start_span"": 221, ""end_span"": 237, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""NPM"", ""start_span"": 252, ""end_span"": 255, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""ALK"", ""start_span"": 258, ""end_span"": 261, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The remaining tyrosines that are phosphorylated in response to ALK activation identified in this study, namely Tyr1078, Tyr1092, Tyr1096, Tyr1131, Tyr1584, and Tyr1586, have been poorly characterized in the context of the full - length ALK RTK, and determination of their significance requires further analysis.

However, work on the oncogenic ALK fusion proteins implicates these residues in binding of IRS - 1 ( Tyr1096) 48, and SNT ( FRS2) ( Tyr1096 and Tyr1507) 49.

In light of the activation of STAT3 by ALK, we also investigated the interaction of ALK with STAT3.

In humans, defensins are classified into two categories, α - and β - defensins. β - defensins are mainly produced by the mucosa and epithelial cells.

Thus, the present study was designed to focus on the effects of hBD3 on TNF - α - stimulated endothelial cell dysfunction, including the enhanced production of inflammatory mediators, monocyte adhesion, and the expression of cell adhesion molecules, all of which are early events in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.

As shown in Figure 2 ( a ), when the cells were treated with TNF - α for 24 h, IL - 8 production in the supernatant was significantly elevated; however, with hBD3 intervention, IL - 8 level was markedly and dose - dependently inhibited.

The NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway is involved in various neuroinflammatory diseases, including multiple sclerosis and the EAE and cuprizone models.

A recent study has reported that microglia express the NLRP3 inflammasome and release IL - 1β [ 45 ], suggesting that the microglial NLRP3 inflammasome probably promotes CNS inflammation and demyelination.

Taken together, these findings suggest that 2ccPA improves the pathological state of EAE and cuprizone model mice by mediating the attenuation of neuroinflammatory conditions ( i. e ., infiltration of immune cells and microglial NLRP3 inflammasome, respectively ).

The incidence of PHN is also linked to the severity of pain experienced during the prior HZ episode ( among other predictors such as the severity of the dermatomal rash and prodromal symptoms) [ 19 ], with those patients experiencing the highest levels of pain during HZ presentation being most at risk of developing PHN [ 20 ].

Key differences in the attribution of outpatient costs for HZ and PHN have been reported for Italy; for patients that did not develop PHN, the majority of the cost of management has been reported to be due to the cost of medication ( 83 %) whereas for patients that develop PHN a greater proportion of cost was attributed to diagnostic and investigative procedures [ 29 ].

Other studies, however, indicate costs of diagnostic procedures to be the smallest contributor to outpatient costs among patients with HZ and PHN ( PHN - 1 and PHN - 3) [ 27 ].

Based on an estimated 260, 995 episodes of HZ occurring annually, with 14% of cases developing PHN, an estimated € 76. 39 milliona is spent on the management of HZ ( including PHN ).

HZ and PHN patients reported sleep to be the aspect of their daily lives most affected by pain ( 4. 5 - 4. 9 and 6. 3 - 6. 5 mean scores respectively ), while walking ability was the least affected in HZ patients ( 1. 7 - 4. 0 mean score) and enjoyment of life was least affected in PHN patients ( 3. 8 - 5. 2 mean score) [ 14, 15, 50, 58, 77 ].

Further, a larger percentage of PHN patients reported extreme anxiety or depression ( 11% vs. 5 %) [ 58, 77 ], evidencing that mood and mental well - being issues are greater for PHN patients.

The majority of patients reported experiencing stress some of the time ( up to 78% for HZ and 91% for PHN) or most of the time ( up to 19% HZ and 41% PHN) [ 58, 77 ].

Finally, the lack of literature relating to the wider societal burden potentially caused by HZ and PHN ( particularly with respect to the impact on caregivers and the broader implications of HZ and PHN on provision of formal and informal social care) may be considered a critical gap.	"HZ	92	94	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	99	102	Disease/Disorder"	"HZ	191	193	Disease/Disorder"	"PHN	198	201	Disease/Disorder"	"[{""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""HZ"", ""start_span"": 191, ""end_span"": 193, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""PHN"", ""start_span"": 198, ""end_span"": 201, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}]"
Furthermore, consideration of healthcare resource use and the economic burden of HZ and PHN has typically focussed on impacts within the healthcare system; the broader implications of HZ and PHN are rarely appreciated.

For example, Arabidopsis plants ectopically expressing gamma carbonic anhydrase 2 ( CA2) have significantly lower ROS contents than wild type, which results in a reduction in the H2O2 - dependent polymerization pathway for lignin formation during anther development and accordingly, causes male sterility [ 36 ].

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of the ccfDNA levels in lymphoma patients, an ROC curve analysis was conducted, and the area under the curve ( AUC) was calculated as 0. 75 ( 95% CI 0. 66 – 0. 84, P = 0. 001) for HL, 0. 86 ( 95% CI 0. 80 – 0. 90, P < 0. 0001) for DLBCL, and 0. 79 ( 95% CI 0. 70 – 0. 87, P < 0. 0001) for NK / TCL, suggesting a moderate discriminatory power.

Hohaus et al. [ 17] also observed significant associations between the ccfDNA concentration and some adverse parameters, whereas a study by Jones et al.

Analysis of genomic data from modern wisent has suggested, in addition, more recent admixture between wisent and the Bos cattle lineage ( Gautier et al.

Furthermore, by inclusion of historical individuals, we not only detect admixture between wisent subspecies and between wisent and the Bos cattle lineage, but also place these events along an absolute timescale of pre - or post - extinction age.

Although the reference genome assembly of Bos taurus would provide a more complete assembly and evolutionarily less - diverged reference for mapping, we did not use this reference at it may have led to biased estimates of admixture between wisent and the Bos cattle lineage, in particular at lower levels of genomic coverage.

Between modern and founding wisent, we found that modern L line wisent share a significantly greater number of derived alleles with founding wisent than the modern LC line individual does ( fig. 5A ), indicating a greater contribution of the two founding wisent investigated here to the L line, relative to the LC line, which is consistent with pedigrees ( Slatis 1960 ).

2011 ), we estimated a fraction of 2. 4 – 3. 2% of the genomes of the modern wisent that could be attributed to admixture with the Bos cattle lineage, above that occurring in the founding wisent ( supplementary table S6, Supplementary Material online ).	"wisent	77	83	Organism/Species"	"Bos	131	134	Organism/Species"	"cattle	135	141	Organism/Species"	"wisent	188	194	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Bos"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""cattle"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 188, ""end_span"": 194, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
This increased admixture signal observed in all modern wisent relative to founding wisent could result from either variable admixture proportions among the founding herd from which all modern wisent are derived, or alternatively, from recent admixture with modern cattle.	"wisent	55	61	Organism/Species"	"wisent	83	89	Organism/Species"	"wisent	192	198	Organism/Species"	"cattle	264	270	Organism/Species"	"[{""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 192, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""cattle"", ""start_span"": 264, ""end_span"": 270, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"
However, the fact that we do not find evidence of any complete genomic 1 Mb blocks resulting from cattle admixture in the modern LC line individual ( fig. 6A) argues strongly against recent cattle admixture, and instead supports variable admixture among the founding herd in explaining the excess of derived alleles shared among domestic cattle and modern wisent.

Low - affinity Pi transporters in the Pht1 family are now thought to play this role in translocation of Pi within the plant, and this has been inferred from the spatial expression of these genes in several different plant species [ 7 ], [ 30 ], [ 49 ], [ 50 ].

Diacylglycerol kinase ( DGK) family of proteins, which phosphorylates diacylglycerol into phosphatidic acid, play important role in controlling diverse cellular processes in eukaryotic organisms.

Sequence alignments of the DGK homologs were also examined for the presence of conserved indels ( insertions or deletions) which were flanked on both sides by at least 5 – 6 conserved residues in the neighboring 30 – 40 amino acids and which appeared to be specifically present in either a particular class of DGK isozymes, or which were shared by the DGK homologs from more one than classes [ 20 – 22 ].

In the simplest of the DGK isozymes, DGK - ε ( sole member of class III DGK ), the catalytic domain (> 300 aa) makes up nearly 60% of the entire protein and thus it comprises the single largest sequence element specific for the DGK family of proteins.

The phylogenetic approach employed in this work was able to clearly distinguish the five different classes of DGKs; however, as the canonical DGK homologs are only found in eukaryotic organisms, it was difficult to root the tree and determine how members of different DGK classes are related to each other and which of these DGK isozymes is ancestral.

Although more detailed studies are needed to establish with certainty the identity of the DGK isoforms that are present in deep branching eukaryotic phyla, the observed broader distribution of the DGK - ε, DGK - θ and DGK - ζ isoforms within eukaryotic organisms suggests that one of these isoforms likely represent the ancestral form of the protein.

For instance, laminin substrates enhance elongation of sensory neurites in vitro when compared to collagen or fibronectin containing scaffolds, whereas fibronectin substrates promote neurite elongation of motor neurons from SC slices in vitro [ 13, 14 ].
