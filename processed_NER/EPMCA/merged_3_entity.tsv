Functional complementation of the aru - 1 mutant was also observed when ARU was driven by the endogenous promoter in a construct also containing 865 bp downstream sequence ( pARU :: ARU ), although there was more line - to - line variability than when the pMYB98 promoter was used ( Supplementary Fig. 7 ).	aru - 1,34,41,Gene/Protein	ARU,72,75,Gene/Protein	ARU,175,178,Gene/Protein	"[{""token"": ""aru - 1"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""ARU"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""ARU"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"	test
In addition, post - transcriptional regulation of gene expression could play a role in mediating ARU protein levels. ARU has a 410 bp long 3 ′- UTR ( 3 ′- untranslated region) 37 containing 17 SNPs that are correlated with the OG / S phenotype and might contribute to accession - specific differences in ARU protein levels.

Slightly increased divergence is observed between the modern LC line individual ( MdLC) and all modern and founding wisent ( fig. 2A ), which may reflect the increased component of Caucasian wisent ancestry in this individual resulting from the captive breeding program.

Through the use of low - coverage genomic data from modern and historical wisent, including from the now extinct Caucasian wisent subspecies, we have revealed the complexity of wisent evolution.	wisent,74,80,Organism/Species	Caucasian wisent,113,129,Organism/Species	wisent,177,183,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Caucasian wisent"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 183, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	test
The accepted view of wisent evolution is of two distinct subspecies, Lowland wisent and Caucasian wisent, that both underwent dramatic population declines, with the last few surviving individuals serving as founders of the modern L ( Lowland only) and LC ( Lowland and Caucasian) lines ( Pucek et al.	wisent,21,27,Organism/Species	Lowland wisent,69,83,Organism/Species	Caucasian wisent,88,104,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Lowland wisent"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Caucasian wisent"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	test
Although the individual from this population ( modern L line, MdL2) that we sequenced does not possess this putative Caucasian wisent allele, we nevertheless detected evidence of Caucasian wisent admixture above that occurring in founding wisent for this individual ( fig. 5 ).	Caucasian wisent,117,133,Organism/Species	Caucasian wisent,179,195,Organism/Species	wisent,239,245,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""Caucasian wisent"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Caucasian wisent"", ""start_span"": 179, ""end_span"": 195, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 239, ""end_span"": 245, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	test
However, the small size of admixed blocks, in addition to non - significant D comparisons of modern lines, supports variable Caucasian wisent admixture among founding wisent in explaining this result, which may also account for the occurrence of putative Caucasian wisent alleles in other individuals from this population.

Our results further support this finding using measures of pairwise genomic divergences among modern and founding wisent, which are approximately equal to or greater than that found between pairs of cattle or yak, respectively.	wisent,114,120,Organism/Species	cattle,199,205,Organism/Species	yak,209,212,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""cattle"", ""start_span"": 199, ""end_span"": 205, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""yak"", ""start_span"": 209, ""end_span"": 212, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	test

Using seven low - coverage wisent genomes from both modern and historical wisent we have revealed multiple instances of admixture, but moreover, because the approximate age of introgression of Caucasian wisent into the modern LC line is known, through comparisons of the sizes of likely admixed genomic segments we have inferred the relative ages of other admixture events.	wisent,27,33,Organism/Species	wisent,74,80,Organism/Species	Caucasian wisent,193,209,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""wisent"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""Caucasian wisent"", ""start_span"": 193, ""end_span"": 209, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	test

Based on the RNA - seq analysis, we examined mTORC1 activity and found that it was decreased in the striatum of Shank3 TG mice.	mTORC1,45,51,Gene/Protein	Shank3,112,118,Gene/Protein	mice,122,126,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""mTORC1"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""Shank3"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	train
Although the RNA - seq analysis revealed altered mTORC1 activity, we consider that the gene expression changes related to mTORC1 signaling could be a secondary or compensatory effect of decreased mTORC1 activity for several reasons.	mTORC1,49,55,Gene/Protein	mTORC1,122,128,Gene/Protein	mTORC1,196,202,Gene/Protein	"[{""token"": ""mTORC1"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""mTORC1"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""mTORC1"", ""start_span"": 196, ""end_span"": 202, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"	train

More comprehensive analyses regarding the activities of mTORC1 in different neuronal populations of the striatum of both Shank3 KO and TG mice will be important, especially considering that D1 and D2 - type MSNs of the striatum have distinct, or even opposite, roles in controlling behavior ( Kravitz et al ., 2010 ).	mTORC1,56,62,Gene/Protein	Shank3,121,127,Gene/Protein	mice,138,142,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""mTORC1"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""Shank3"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	train

Considering this view, the highest Arg / Lys ratio in RP - E ( 3. 15 ), the higher in RP - A ( 2. 56) and the lowest in CAS ( 0. 44) might explain the different levels in plasma cholesterol and fecal output of sterols in the present study.

Because the Fgf21 promoter contains nuclear receptor response elements and E - boxes ( Estall et al ., 2009; Tong et al ., 2010 ), we investigated whether Fgf21 is regulated directly or indirectly by clock components.

Since REV - ERBα is a nuclear receptor with repressive potential, we tested whether REV - ERBα can directly regulate the Fgf21 promoter.

In contrast, the R4 element appeared to be involved in the repression of Fgf21 by REV - ERBα, as mutation of this element partially abolished the repressive potential of REV - ERBα ( Fig. 2C ).

In contrast, binding of HNF6 to the Fgf21 promoter was not time - of - day dependent and only occurred in the R1 element, which includes the HNF6 binding site.

We confirmed that mutant proteins were produced in a comparable amount to wild - type Spo5, by examining the shortest mutant Spo5 ( 1 – 296) and the RRM2 - deletion mutant, although the protein level might be slightly lower in the latter case ( Additional 1: Figure S1 ).

While we could not exclude the possibility that some of the effect of the mutations on sporulation might be due to lower levels of the mutant proteins, the effect on sporulation was apparently more dramatic than the effect on protein levels, supporting the importance of the RRMs / cytoplasmic localization in Spo5 function. There was one exception, namely Spo5 ( 1 – 456 )- GFP, which has two RRMs but lacks the C - terminal region.

The apparent difference in localization may also reflect changes in the strain construction: In the previous study, the spo5 mutant allele was integrated into the chromosomal leu1 locus, whereas the mutant allele was integrated in the authentic spo5 locus in our case.	spo5,120,124,Gene/Protein	leu1,175,179,Gene/Protein	spo5,245,249,Gene/Protein	"[{""token"": ""spo5"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""leu1"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 179, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""spo5"", ""start_span"": 245, ""end_span"": 249, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"	train

We induced meiosis in wild - type ( WT) and rae1 - 167 cells at 25 ° C, the latter of which produced Spo5 protein in a comparable or slightly lower amount ( Additional file 1: Figure S1 ), and transferred the cells to 36 ° C to inactivate Rae1 - 167.	rae1,44,48,Gene/Protein	Spo5,101,105,Gene/Protein	Rae1,239,243,Gene/Protein	"[{""token"": ""rae1"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""Spo5"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""Rae1"", ""start_span"": 239, ""end_span"": 243, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"	train

While the destabilization of Spo5 – NLS was likely to contribute largely to the sporulation defect, enforced nuclear migration of Spo5 also appeared to abolish its function to promote meiosis and sporulation, suggesting that the nuclear export of Spo5 is important for its optimal function.

It can be seen from Fig. 3a that transfection of p53 siRNA into senescent cells can stimulate transduction of HPV - 16 PsVs 16 days after exposure to the virus.	p53,49,52,Gene/Protein	HPV - 16,110,118,Organism/Species	virus,154,159,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""p53"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""HPV - 16"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""virus"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 159, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	train
This suggests that in a normal virus infection cells need not be immediately proliferating to still be susceptible to virus infection, and that quite extended periods of time might pass before proliferation and mitosis commences.

In order to determine where HPV - 16 PsVs might reside for such extended periods of time we first analysed whether the virus was susceptible to antibody - induced neutralisation.

These results demonstrate that the virus is most likely residing on, or very close to the cell surface, in a compartment that can be accessed by the anti - L1 antibody.	virus,35,40,Organism/Species	L1,156,158,Gene/Protein	antibody,159,167,Gene/Protein	"[{""token"": ""virus"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}, {""token"": ""L1"", ""start_span"": 156, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""antibody"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 167, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"	train
As can be seen from Fig. 5, there is no major change in endocytic uptake of transferrin in the p53 siRNA - transfected senescent cells, indicating that lack of virus uptake is not due to the simple shutting down of endocytic transport pathways.	transferrin,76,87,Gene/Protein	p53,95,98,Gene/Protein	virus,160,165,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""transferrin"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""p53"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""virus"", ""start_span"": 160, ""end_span"": 165, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	train
This is supported by the quantifications from multiple assays when looking at the average transferrin intensity per cell, but also when integrating transferrin intensity, where the average intensity of transferrin is multiplied by the cell area.

Having found that the HPV - 16 PsVs remained antibody - neutralisable for an extended period post - infection in the senescent cells, we then proceeded to investigate in more detail where such virions might reside prior to cell cycle re - entry.

We then wanted to investigate whether we could visualise the anti - L1 neutralising antibody ( H16. V5) co - localising with the surface - bound HPV - 16 PsVs in the senescent cells.

As can be seen from Fig. 7a, the anti - L1 neutralising antibody binds to the surface of uninfected BJ cells, and this pattern does not change significantly following transfection of the p53 siRNA.

These results thus confirm that HPV - 16 PsVs in the non - dividing cells are readily accessible to the neutralising antibody owing to the virus accumulating at a surface - exposed location.

However, the efficacy of the model was demonstrated following transfection of the senescent cells with a p53 siRNA; this induced cell cycle re - entry and rendered the cells susceptible to infection with the HPV - 16 PsVs.	p53,105,108,Gene/Protein	infection,189,198,Disease/Disorder	HPV - 16,208,216,Organism/Species	"[{""token"": ""p53"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""infection"", ""start_span"": 189, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""Disease/Disorder""}, {""token"": ""HPV - 16"", ""start_span"": 208, ""end_span"": 216, ""type"": ""Organism/Species""}]"	train
Firstly in all assays, we found that anti - L1 neutralising antibody could very effectively abolish virus infection, even in cultures where the cells had been exposed to virions nearly two weeks prior to neutralisation.

However, the digesters investigated in this study had low levels of ammonia, and similar to the manure ( Risberg et al ., 2013 ), thus this parameter is not the likely cause for the shift in the methanogenic community. Methanosarcina can also use the hydrogenotrophic pathway for methanogenesis, unlike the other acetotrophic methanogen Methanosaeta, and this might also enhance its competitive ability, even at low acetate levels as prevailing in the investigated digesters ( De Vrieze et al ., 2012 ).

The cause of the increase in Clostridia / Bacilli ratio in the digesters relative to the manure is not clear, but one possible explanation is that the availability of easily fermentable sugar is comparably lower in the anaerobic digester ( Walter et al ., 2011 ).
