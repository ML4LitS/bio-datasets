The PmrA / PmrB system controls lipopolysaccharide modifications mediating resistance to the antibiotic polymyxin B.

The PmrA - regulated products characterized thus far mediate modifications to the various components of the lipopolysacharide ( LPS) structure including the lipid A ( Gunn et al., 1998; Trent et al., 2001; Zhou et al., 2001; Breazeale et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2004), the core region ( Nishino et al., 2006) and the O - antigen ( Delgado et al., 2006).

There was residual pbgP expression in the pmrB mutant induced with mild acid pH ( Fig. 3), which was in contrast to the absence of pbgP transcription in the pmrA mutant ( Fig. 2).	"pbgP	19	23	Protein"	"pmrB	42	46	Protein"	"pbgP	131	135	Protein"	"pmrA	157	161	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""pbgP"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pmrB"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pbgP"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pmrA"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, we tested the possibility of PmrD participating in the PmrA - dependent response to acidic conditions, and thus contributing to the pbgP transcription remaining in a pmrB mutant.

Expression of the pbgP gene was abolished in a pmrB pmrD double mutant ( Fig. 3) indicating that both genes are necessary to activate PmrA under acidic conditions.

In contrast to the phenotype of the pta ackA double mutant, pbgP transcription was reduced in the pmrD mutant ( Fig. 3).

The acid - promoted expression of the PmrD protein was phoPQ - dependent, which is in agreement with the fact that PhoP is the only known direct transcriptional activator of pmrD ( Kox et al., 2000).

In fact, PmrB is required for the activation of PmrA - regulated genes in response to the low Mg2 + signal, which is sensed by the PhoQ protein ( Kato and Groisman, 2004) ( Fig. 1).

We have established that the sensor kinase PmrB is the primary sensor that activates the PmrA protein when Salmonella experiences mild acid pH, resulting in transcription of PmrA - activated genes ( Fig. 1).	"PmrB	43	47	Protein"	"PmrA	89	93	Protein"	"Salmonella	107	117	Organism"	"PmrA	174	178	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 174, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The PmrB protein plays the primary role in the pH - dependent activation of PmrA, but full activation also requires PmrD, the post - translational activator of the PmrA protein ( Fig. 3).	"PmrB	4	8	Protein"	"PmrA	76	80	Protein"	"PmrD	116	120	Protein"	"PmrA	164	168	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PmrD"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 168, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The levels of phosphorylated PmrA are determined by the balance of the autokinase + phosphotransferase activity of PmrB and PmrB ' s phosphatase activity towards phospho - PmrA.

This may be particularly important for Salmonella living in soil due to the fact that the antimicrobial peptide polymyxin B is produced by the soil bacterium Paenibacillus polymyxa ( Paulus and Gray, 1964) and because the solubility of metals such as Fe3 + increases in acid pH.

Finally, while a role for the PmrA - dependent LPS modifications in the previously described acid tolerance response is unlikely because survival to acid stress ( pH approximately3) was not reduced in cells deficient in pmrA ( data not shown and Bearson et al., 1998), some of the PmrA - regulated genes to which no function has been ascribed yet could mediate other cellular responses to acid pH.

Although many factors and a complex mechanism related to environmental stimuli are involved in the modulation of SPI1 genes, they are thought to converge on the activation of several transcriptional regulators encoded within SPI1, such as HilA, HilC, HilD and InvF ( 7 - 9).	"HilA	239	243	Protein"	"HilC	245	249	Protein"	"HilD	251	255	Protein"	"InvF	260	264	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""HilA"", ""start_span"": 239, ""end_span"": 243, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""HilC"", ""start_span"": 245, ""end_span"": 249, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""HilD"", ""start_span"": 251, ""end_span"": 255, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""InvF"", ""start_span"": 260, ""end_span"": 264, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
HilC and HilD also directly activate the alternative promoter of the invF operon, which is independent of HilA ( 15, 16).	"HilC	0	4	Protein"	"HilD	9	13	Protein"	"invF	69	73	Protein"	"HilA	106	110	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""HilC"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""HilD"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""invF"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""HilA"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Similar to HilC and HilD, RtsA activates the expression of SPI1 genes by binding upstream of the master regulatory gene, hilA, to induce its expression ( 9, 17).

( 20) have found that HilE plays an important regulatory role in the expression of the Salmonella - invasive phenotype by affecting hilA transcription through direct interaction with HilD.

The specificity of the Mlc effect was verified by complementation, as the plasmid pKB, which expresses mlc, restored the transcriptional level of hilE in SR1304 almost to that of the wild - type strain ( Figure 4B, lane 4).

Two Mlc - binding sites, one at position - 10 to + 12 ( Mlc 1) and the other at position - 86 to - 108 ( Mlc 2) with respect to the transcriptional start site of hilE P3, were identified ( Figure 5B).

Interestingly, arabinose also activated hilE, albeit to a lesser degree than either glucose or mannose.

This regulatory cascade implies that the reduced invasive phenotype of mlc mutant is the result of hilD repression, which affects both hilA and invF expression ( Figures 1 and 2).

All of the carbohydrates tested in this study, with the exception of glycerol, increased hilD expression by approximately1. 1 - 1. 2 - fold, even though hilE expression in the mlc mutant was increased by approximately30% in the presence of the sugars tested ( Figure 6).

It has been suggested that the two - component regulatory system PhoR - PhoB leads to increased hilE P2 expression and subsequent repression of hilA and invasion genes ( 7, 18).

During the past decades, a series of virulence determinants of SS2 involved in the survival, spread and pathopoiesis of the bacterium within the host have been identified, such as capsule polysaccharide ( CPS), muramidase - related protein ( MRP), suilysin, etc.	"SS2	63	66	Organism"	"capsule polysaccharide	180	202	Chemical"	"CPS	205	208	Chemical"	"suilysin	248	256	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""SS2"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""capsule polysaccharide"", ""start_span"": 180, ""end_span"": 202, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""CPS"", ""start_span"": 205, ""end_span"": 208, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""suilysin"", ""start_span"": 248, ""end_span"": 256, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Prior to this study, SalK / SalR is only known to be associated with the production of a kind of lantibiotic peptide named salivaricin A ( SalA) in S. salivarius [ 11], as yet, this TCSTS has not been linked to the regulation of bacterial virulence.

Taken together, a connection between sigmaE and SsrB is suggested from the available literature, however the role of sigmaE in activating SsrB - regulated genes has not been studied.	"sigmaE	37	43	Regulon"	"SsrB	48	52	Protein"	"sigmaE	117	123	Regulon"	"SsrB	138	142	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""sigmaE"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Regulon""}, {""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sigmaE"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Regulon""}, {""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Both rpoE and rpoN deletions resulted in decreased SseB levels with a more pronounced effect in the rpoE deletion.

Typhimurium strain SL1344 and we verified that this in - frame deletion had the same effect on SseB as the rpoE:: cat mutant used previously ( Figure 1B).

A low - copy plasmid containing full - length rpoE and the three endogenous promoters that can drive its expression [ 20] was able to restore wild type levels of SseB to DeltarpoE cells ( Figure 1B) demonstrating that the results were specific to the rpoE deletion.

Relative to its expression in wild type cells, the level of SrfN - 2HA was reproducibly increased in the DeltarpoE cells, suggesting a role for sigmaE in the repression of SrfN, although it is unlikely that this is through a direct mechanism.

The variable effects of rpoE deletion on SsrB - regulated effectors suggested that RpoE might direct transcription downstream of ssrB expression.	"rpoE	24	28	Protein"	"SsrB	41	45	Protein"	"RpoE	83	87	Protein"	"ssrB	129	133	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""rpoE"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RpoE"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ssrB"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To test this, we replaced the ssrB gene in DeltarpoE and wild type cells with an ssrB:: FLAG allele [ 19] and examined the levels of SsrB protein in the strains by western blot.	"ssrB	30	34	Protein"	"DeltarpoE	43	52	Protein"	"ssrB	81	85	Protein"	"SsrB	133	137	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ssrB"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""DeltarpoE"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ssrB"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
There was no change in the levels of SsrB - FLAG between wild type and DeltarpoE cells ( Figure 3), indicating that the effects of RpoE on the four classes of virulence gene promoters examined here was not mediated through changes to SsrB protein levels.

The lack of a canonical sigmaE sequence at these promoters suggests that another regulatory gene may be epistatic to sigmaE or that these promoters encode functional, but non - canonical sigmaE - binding sites due to their horizontal acquisition and gradual integration into the sigmaE regulatory network.	"sigmaE	24	30	Regulon"	"sigmaE	117	123	Regulon"	"sigmaE	187	193	Regulon"	"sigmaE	279	285	Regulon"	"[{""token"": ""sigmaE"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Regulon""}, {""token"": ""sigmaE"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Regulon""}, {""token"": ""sigmaE"", ""start_span"": 187, ""end_span"": 193, ""type"": ""Regulon""}, {""token"": ""sigmaE"", ""start_span"": 279, ""end_span"": 285, ""type"": ""Regulon""}]"
Our results indicate that rpoE deletion has no effect on SsrB levels under SPI - 2 inducing conditions suggesting that the sigmaE pathway regulates effector expression downstream of ssrAB transcription.

The chemotaxis gene cluster I ( PA1456 - PA1464) and cluster V ( PA3349 - PA3348) have previously been shown to be essential for chemotaxis and flagellar mobility in P. aeruginosa [ 23], [ 24].

The wsp genes contained in cluster III ( PA3708 - PA3702) have been proposed to contribute to bacterial biofilm formation [ 25], whereas the cluster IV ( Pil - Chp system, PA0408 - PA0417) has been shown to be involved in twitching motility [ 26], [ 27].

The TB0173s ( cheB2) ( Figure 2 and Table 1) and TB4953s ( motB) ( Table 1) mutants showed a reduction in swimming and swarming motility, respectively.

Both cheB2 mutants, TB0173s and TB0173i, required at least one additional day, as compared to TB, to kill 50% of exposed nematodes.

The parental TB strain was able to move towards the attractant ( an increase of slightly more than half a log of bacteria over 45 min) and the TB0173s strain ( cheB2 mutant) was also capable of chemotaxis, even though much reduced as compared to TB ( Figure S4).

Moreover, Burrowes and collaborators reported that RsmA exerted control over cheB2 with a 10 - fold reduction in expression of cheB2 in an rsmA mutant [ 59].

Furthermore, in our study, we isolated a second mutant with reduced motility TB4953s ( motB mutant) ( Table 1), and while this isolate was attenuated in the high throughput assay, it did not show a reduction in killing in the slow assay ( data not shown), further suggesting that the loss of virulence seen in the cheB2 mutant strain ( TB0173s) is not solely due to a reduction or change in motility.
