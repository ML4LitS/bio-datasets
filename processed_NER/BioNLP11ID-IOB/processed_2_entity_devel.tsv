Substitution of a conserved histidine or of either one of four conserved glutamic acid residues in the periplasmic domain of PmrB severely decreased or abolished the mild acid - promoted transcription of PmrA - activated genes.

Wild - type Salmonella grown at pH 5. 8 were > 100 000 - fold more resistant to polymyxin B than organisms grown at pH 7. 7.

The acid tolerance response of Salmonella results in the synthesis of over 50 acid shock proteins ( Bearson et al., 1998) that are likely to function primarily when variations in internal pH occur, i. e. when Salmonella experiences severe acidic conditions ( pH approximately3) ( Foster, 2004).

Growth of Salmonella in mild acid ( pH 5. 8) also promotes transcription of genes regulated by the response regulator PmrA ( Soncini and Groisman, 1996).

While other PmrA - regulated genes have been identified ( Marchal et al., 2004; Tamayo et al., 2005), their biochemical activities and the role ( s) that they play in Salmonella ' s life remain unknown.

The transcriptional activation of PmrA - regulated genes taking place at pH 5. 8 could be due to trace amounts of metals such as Fe3 +, which is more soluble at acidic pH.

To rule out this possibility, we treated the culture medium with Chelex 100 resin, an agent known to chelate polyvalent metal ions that does not affect Salmonella growth.

We determined that the regulatory protein PmrA is required for the transcriptional activation in response to mild acid pH because there was no induction of the three investigated genes in a pmrA mutant ( Fig. 2A - C).

From these results we conclude that Salmonella harbours a signalling pathway that responds to mild acid pH by activating the PmrA protein through phosphorylation.

While this mutation severely diminished the ability of Salmonella to respond to mild acid pH, there still was some residual pbgP expression ( Fig. 6B) suggesting that other residues might also be required for pH sensing.

The requirement of periplasmic PmrB residues in the mild acid pH activation of PmrA - regulated genes suggests that this signalling pathway responds to changes in extracytoplasmic pH.

Second, acid stress can become a severe challenge for bacterial cells when organic acids such as acetate or products of fermentation are present in the medium ( Bearson et al., 1998); and in our experiments we used a non - fermentable sugar ( glycerol) and inorganic acids which are not expected to cause such acid stress.

The fact that the PmrB H35A and the E64A mutant proteins displayed partial activity in response to ferric iron but were severely impaired in their ability to respond to acid pH ( compare Fig. 6B and D) supports the notion that these signals are sensed independently.

Thus, PmrD may be necessary to ensure that the amount of phosphorylated PmrA is such to promote transcription of its regulated genes.

Because several PmrA - activated gene products are responsible for remodelling the LPS structure and these modifications are required for resistance to certain antimicrobial peptides and toxic metals, one possibility is that acidic environments provide a means to induce the cell envelope changes resulting in resistance.

Therefore, it seemed possible that Mlc also affects the virulence of Salmonella.

Mutation of the mlc gene reduces Salmonella invasiveness The process of invasion into non - phagocytic epithelial cells, which is known to be mediated by proteins secreted by the SPI1 - encoded type III machinery ( 3), is an important initial step in the pathogenesis of S.

When the number of intracellular bacteria were measured at 2 and 18h post - infection, the degree of replication was similar for SL1344 and SR1304 ( Figure 1D).

We performed a primer extension assay of total RNA isolated from SL1344 grown to exponential phase in static culture, using the primer described by Baxter and Jones ( 18), to discover which promoter is regulated by Mlc.

This difference could be attributed to differences in the experimental model conditions; in our study, total RNA from a Salmonella strain was used in the primer extension assay, whereas Baxter and Jones ( 18) used total RNA prepared from E. coli harboring the hilE reporter plasmid pMAB69.

When the labeled hilE promoter DNA was incubated with 2 - fold dilutions of the purified Mlc - His6 protein ( 100 - 800nM) in the presence of the non - specific DNA competitor poly dI - dC, the concentration - dependent formation of protein - DNA complexes was observed ( Figure 5A).

The addition of cold probe released the labeled probe from the retarded complex ( Figure 5A, right panel), which indicates specific binding of Mlc to the hilE P3 promoter DNA.

Although the Salmonella mlc mutant was less invasive for epithelial cells than the wild - type strain, the extent of the reduction in invasiveness and cytotoxicity of the mlc mutant was not as great as we had expected, considering the observed reduction in SPI1 gene expression ( Figure 2).

The UTR of the hilA gene is also up to 350nt in length, and is suggested to be involved in the complex regulation of hilA in response to environmental signals ( 8, 12).

We speculate that the nutrient - rich LB broth may mask the effect of the sugar on hilE expression because the effect of sugar addition on hilA expression was more distinct in DLB than LB ( 45).

These results suggest that the presence of complex regulatory mechanisms for hilE is required for optimal regulation of the SPI1 genes, as can be expected from the complex regulatory networks identified in Salmonella ( 46).

To date, SalK / SalR is still a little - reported TCSTS in the fast - growing field of bacterial pathogenesis.

In the present study, we attempted to generate the deletion mutant of salKR and assess the contribution of this TCSTS to the high pathogenicity of Chinese SS2 strains.

Discovery and Characterization of SalK / SalR The newly decoded genomic sequence of S. suis 05ZYH33 makes it possible to systematically investigate the genetic basis of streptococcal pathogenicity.

Notably, the average GC content of salKR, 29. 9%, is much less than that of both 89K and the whole genome of 05ZYH33 ( 36. 8% and 41. 1%, respectively) ( Fig. 1B).

The salK coding region overlaps that of salR by 20 base pairs ( bp), and no putative promoter or transcriptional terminator could be identified within either gene.

Further sequence analysis revealed a palindrome of 55 bp with the potential to form a stem - loop structure situated in the intergenic region between salR and 05SSU0942, which may function as a transcriptional terminator.	"salR	150	154	Protein"	"05SSU0942	159	168	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""salR"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""05SSU0942"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 168, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
05SSU0945, situated upstream ( 729 bp long intergenic region) of the salKR locus, encodes a 94 aa polypeptide for which there were no significant database matches.

To confirm the predicted transcripts of salKR and the flanking genes, RNA extracted from S. suis 05ZYH33 cells was subjected to RT - PCR analysis by using primers amplifying each intergenic region of salKR and the flanking genes.

To check this suspected mutant, Southern hybridization analyses were employed using probes of SpcR gene, an internal fragment of salKR, and pUC18, respectively.	"SpcR	94	98	Protein"	"salKR	129	134	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SpcR"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""salKR"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In the suspected mutant, a 3. 6 kb restriction fragment hybridized with the SpcR probe ( Fig. 3B, lane 2), while no hybridization signal was detected when the internal fragment of salKR and pUC18 served as the probes ( Fig. 3C and 3D, lane 2).

Additionally, the allelic replacement of the wild - type salKR genes by the SpcR cassette in the suspected mutant was also confirmed by multiple - PCR analysis and sequencing with primers specific to genomic regions lying out the homologous left and right arms ( Fig. 3A and 3E).

All these results demonstrate that an isogenic knockout mutant of salKR ( namely DeltasalKR) was successfully constructed.

Given the multiple roles of TCSTS in bacteria, we evaluated the effect of salKR deletion on the general biological characteristics of SS2 prior to in vivo work.

In contrast, six infected piglets with an avirulent strain, 05HAS68 ( as negative control), survived nearly without any obvious symptoms until the end of the experiment ( 14 days after infection).

Wherein the six piglets challenged with the DeltasalKR mutant were all alive and symptom - free during the entire course monitored.

Five out of six piglets succumbed to the lethal infections of CDeltasalKR and died, with median survival times of 2 to 3 days.

As shown in Table 1, wild - type bacteria were found in all of the SS2 specific tissues of WT - infected piglets, including heart, lung, liver, kidney, spleen, tonsil, brain, blood, joints and so on.	"SS2	67	70	Organism"	"piglets	105	112	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""SS2"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""piglets"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In the WT / DeltasalKR coinfection group, besides the detection of wild - type bacteria in all the specimens, DeltasalKR mutant bacteria could also be isolated from some susceptible tissues ( such as heart, kidney, tonsil and brain) at a lower degree than the wild - type strain.

We anticipated that the DeltasalKR mutant is still able to colonize these organs, is just due to the WT - mediated impairment of host defense against SS2 infection in these tissues.

However, DeltasalKR had a higher mortality rate than that of WT, which means that DeltasalKR was less able to resist killing by PMNs, key mediators of innate immunity.

In total, the absence of SalK / SalR led to decreased expression of 26 genes spread throughout the genome ( i. e. 1. 2% of the 2194 tested).

To examine the validity of the microarray data, we performed further quantitative real - time PCR analysis on 42 genes using RNA from three independent cultures of each strain ( WT, the DeltasalKR mutant and the complemented strain CDeltasalKR).	"DeltasalKR	186	196	Protein"	"CDeltasalKR	232	243	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltasalKR"", ""start_span"": 186, ""end_span"": 196, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CDeltasalKR"", ""start_span"": 232, ""end_span"": 243, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
[ 6] reported a candidate PAI of approximately89 kb in the epidemic outbreak strains of SS2 infections in China, gave some genomic clues for elucidating molecular pathways by which SS2 behaved so aggressively.

In this study, we carried out a detailed structural and functional analysis of a unique two - component regulatory system designated SalK / SalR which is located in the putative 89K PAI.

Moreover, PCR analysis using primers amplifying the salKR locus also demonstrated that this TCSTS is specific to Chinese epidemic outbreak strains of SS2 ( data not shown), implying its tight linkage to the virulence of this new emerging pathogenic species.

Results of piglets experimental infections clearly showed that the deletion of salKR leads to elimination of the lethality of this important pathogen.

Colonization analysis also revealed the incapability of the DeltasalKR mutant to colonize any susceptible tissue of piglets when administered alone.	"DeltasalKR	60	70	Protein"	"piglets	116	123	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""DeltasalKR"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""piglets"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The reduction in virulence was mostly restored in a complemented strain upon reintroduction of functional copies of salK and salR into the mutant, suggesting that it did not result from polar effects on expression of flanking genes.	"salK	116	120	Protein"	"salR	125	129	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""salK"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""salR"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, genes immediately flanking the salKR locus were identified as transcriptionally unaffected by the disruption of the salKR genes.

This result is in agreement with the predicted operon organization in the genome, which suggests that salK and salR are a single co - transcriptional unit.

Among the 26 target genes affected by SalK / SalR, 17 of them ( 65. 4%) were predicted to be monocistronically transcribed, the others to be part of larger transcriptional units ( Table 2).

However, in our study, neither microarray findings nor further analysis of real - time quantitative RT - PCR revealed any differences in level of transcription of the known virulence factors ( CPS, suilysin, MRP and EF) between the wild type and mutant strain.

Although proficient at cellular invasion, rpoE or ssrB mutants are highly attenuated for intracellular survival in both cultured cells and animal hosts [ 16].

Deletion of rseA in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis causes elevated virulence effector synthesis and secretion [ 18], establishing links between alternative sigma factors and virulence - specific regulators.

We tested the hypothesis that RpoE is involved in expression of genes that use the SsrB response regulator for activation.

These data help unite the virulence phenotypes of strains lacking SsrB and RpoE, and highlight new transcriptional regulation that might be essential for appropriate temporal and spatial control of the virulence - associated type III secretion system during host infection.

In these complementation experiments, attempts were made to examine the levels of SseB secreted into the culture supernatant [ 21], however consistent with previous observations [ 22, 23] perturbations to the rpoE pathway increased cell lysis resulting in contamination of secreted fractions with cytosolic proteins which precluded accurate interpretation ( data not shown).

Together, these data indicate that sigmaE can have a variable and bidirectional effect on SsrB - regulated virulence genes.

We predict that RpoE confers a similar fine - tuning effect on Salmonella virulence gene expression that is required for optimal within - host fitness during infection.	"RpoE	16	20	Protein"	"Salmonella	63	73	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""RpoE"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Due to the high degree of conservation in sigma factor binding sequences, sigmaE may not be directly regulating SsrB - dependent promoters.	"sigmaE	74	80	Regulon"	"SsrB	112	116	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""sigmaE"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Regulon""}, {""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This mechanism would activate a restorative sigmaE pathway, which is consistent with the enhanced susceptibility of rpoE mutants to oxidative stress and antimicrobial peptides [ 13, 15, 16], both of which perturb membrane integrity in vivo.	"sigmaE	44	50	Regulon"	"rpoE	116	120	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""sigmaE"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Regulon""}, {""token"": ""rpoE"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Unlinking ssrAB transcription from the sigmaE regulon would be advantageous to the cell to prevent commitment to a virulence gene expression program in response to envelope stress not associated with infection.

Based on these and other data [ 4, 12 - 15], the genetic interaction between sigmaE and a subset of SsrB - regulated genes may serve to coordinate the spatial and temporal activation of virulence genes in a host setting, likely in response to membrane damage resulting from oxidative anti - microbial systems and membrane - targeted host defence peptides.

We show that, in contrast to the cheB2 mutant, a cheB1 mutant is not attenuated for virulence in C. elegans whereas in vitro motility and chemotaxis are severely impaired.	"cheB2	33	38	Protein"	"cheB1	49	54	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheB1"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We conclude that the virulence defect of the cheB2 mutant is not linked with a global motility defect but that instead the cheB2 gene is involved in a specific chemotactic response, which takes place during infection and is required for P. aeruginosa pathogenicity.

The ubiquitous Gram - negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen able to infect a broad range of animals and plants hosts including humans.

Finally, C. elegans death, called red death, is observed in response to PAO1 grown on phosphate - depleted medium in conjunction with physiological stress on the nematodes [ 10].

In this study, we used the P. aeruginosa strain TBCF10839 ( TB), which was isolated from a Cystic Fibrosis ( CF) patient [ 14].	"TB	48	50	Organism"	"patient	113	120	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""TB"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
By testing these mutants in additional phenotypic assays, including adherence to epithelial cells and virulence in a mouse model, we identified a gene, cheB2, necessary for in vivo P. aeruginosa virulence.

High Throughput Assay for Nematode Killing by P. aeruginosa It was reported earlier that relatively high - throughput screening procedures performed on plates could be used to identify virulence factors in various pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus [ 32], P. aeruginosa [ 8] or Serratia marcescens [ 33].

We used a gacA mutant from the PA14 transposon library ( http: / / ausubellab. mgh. harvard. edu / cgi - bin / pa14 / home. cgi) [ 34], which is affected in a gene encoding a response regulator involved in virulence [ 8].

Another gene was identified as PA4554, which encodes the type 4 fimbrial adhesin PilY1 [ 41].	"PA4554	31	37	Protein"	"PilY1	81	86	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PA4554"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PilY1"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
First, PA4953 encodes a protein with similarity to the E. coli MotB, one of a pair of proteins, which contributes to flagellar rotation [ 23], [ 42], [ 43].	"PA4953	7	13	Protein"	"MotB	63	67	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PA4953"", ""start_span"": 7, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""MotB"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Secondly, we found an insertion in PA0173 ( cheB2), one of four cheB gene homologues in the P. aeruginosa genome sequence.	"PA0173	35	41	Protein"	"cheB2	44	49	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PA0173"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
PA0173 lies within the chemotactic gene cluster II found in the PAO1 genome ( Figure 1) [ 21].	"PA0173	0	6	Protein"	"PAO1	64	68	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""PA0173"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 6, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PAO1"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In the remaining mutants, one contained a transposon insertion in PA5479, which encodes a protein similar to GltP from E. coli, a glutamate - aspartate carrier protein.	"PA5479	66	72	Protein"	"GltP	109	113	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PA5479"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GltP"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The uvrC gene is located downstream from the gacA gene encoding a response regulator known to be involved in P. aeruginosa virulence.

Since, in addition to the insertion in PA2585, we isolated a mutant with an insertion in a neighbor gene PA2588, it suggests that this cluster of genes might be required for virulence.	"PA2585	39	45	Protein"	"PA2588	105	111	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PA2585"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PA2588"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In order to compare our liquid assay with the established C. elegans slow killing assay, we compared the lethality of the TB strain with the previously tested PA14 strain.	"TB	122	124	Organism"	"PA14	159	163	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""TB"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""PA14"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 163, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We chose to further characterize the TB0173s mutant ( cheB2), as this isolate was affected in all phenotypes tested and thus exhibited a general motility and virulence defect ( Table 1).	"TB0173s	37	44	Organism"	"cheB2	54	59	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TB0173s"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The reactions were performed simultaneously using PA14 or TB genomic DNA as matrix.	"PA14	50	54	Organism"	"TB	58	60	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""PA14"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""TB"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Each paired reaction set ( TB / PA14) resulted in products running at the same migratory rate within the 1. 5% agarose gel ( data not shown).	"TB	27	29	Organism"	"PA14	32	36	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""TB"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""PA14"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These results show that there is little difference between the two isolates, TB and PA14, with regards the overall organization of the che2 chromosomal region.	"TB	77	79	Organism"	"PA14	84	88	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""TB"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""PA14"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In addition, we engineered a similar cheB2 mutation in the P. aeruginosa PA14 strain, yielding PA140173i ( see Materials and Methods), and observed similar virulence attenuation on C. elegans ( Figure S3).	"cheB2	37	42	Protein"	"PA140173i	95	104	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PA140173i"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This further confirmed the virulence phenotype of a cheB2 mutant and indicated that it is not a TB strain - specific trait.	"cheB2	52	57	Protein"	"TB	96	98	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TB"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We reintroduced, in the cheB2 mutant, the wild - type cheB2 gene using an integration - proficient vector, mini - CTX1 [ 47].	"cheB2	24	29	Protein"	"cheB2	54	59	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The empty vector, mini - CTX1, was also introduced into the TB0173s cheB2 mutant, generating TB0173sCTX.	"cheB2	68	73	Protein"	"TB0173sCTX	93	103	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TB0173sCTX"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
As shown in Figure 3B the virulence was restored in the complemented cheB2 mutant TB0173sp2B2 ( p < 0. 009), whereas the cheB2 mutant strain TB0173sCTX ( p < 0. 005) remained fully attenuated.	"cheB2	69	74	Protein"	"cheB2	121	126	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Interestingly, the cheB1 mutant showed no significant reduction in C. elegans killing when compared to the parental TB strain, with only 36% of the worms alive after 4 days post infection.	"cheB1	19	24	Protein"	"TB	116	118	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""cheB1"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TB"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The swimming or swarming motility defect is, however, much more severe in the cheB1 mutant as compared to the cheB2 mutant.	"cheB1	78	83	Protein"	"cheB2	110	115	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cheB1"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, the TB1459i strain ( cheB1 mutant) was no longer able to move towards the attractant, and thus showed a defect in this chemotaxis assay ( Figure S4).	"TB1459i	13	20	Organism"	"cheB1	30	35	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TB1459i"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""cheB1"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The cheB2 Mutant Shows Reduced Virulence in Mice	"cheB2	4	9	Protein"	"Mice	44	48	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Mice"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We further tested the virulence of the cheB2 mutant TB0173s in a mouse model of lung infection, utilizing the view - controlled intratracheal infection protocol [ 48].	"cheB2	39	44	Protein"	"mouse	65	70	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
As many as 26 MCPs have been identified in P. aeruginosa [ 56], and it has been proposed that the CheB2 protein functions at least with McpB [ 57].	"CheB2	98	103	Protein"	"McpB	136	140	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CheB2"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""McpB"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Interestingly, we observed that a mutation in the cheB1 gene yields different phenotypes compared to the cheB2 mutation.	"cheB1	50	55	Protein"	"cheB2	105	110	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cheB1"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Finally, in chemotaxis assays using tryptone as chemo - attractant, we observed that, while the cheB1 mutant was strongly affected, the cheB2 mutant had a mild phenotype.	"cheB1	96	101	Protein"	"cheB2	136	141	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cheB1"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Schuster and collaborators have reported that the cluster II genes are induced during stationary phase, are regulated by quorum sensing and that RpoS, the stationary phase RNA polymerase sigma factor, plays a role in controlling cheB2 gene expression [ 58].	"RpoS	145	149	Protein"	"cheB2	229	234	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RpoS"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 229, ""end_span"": 234, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Finally, using fluorescent protein - tagged CheY and CheA, it was shown that the Che1 proteins ( cluster I) localized to the flagellated pole throughout growth [ 61].	"CheY	44	48	Protein"	"CheA	53	57	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CheY"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CheA"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As previously mentioned, even though the cheB2 mutant is impaired in motility, it is likely that the cheB2 defect in virulence is not linked to this phenotype but to additional traits of virulence and attachment that have not yet been determined.	"cheB2	41	46	Protein"	"cheB2	101	106	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheB2"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
