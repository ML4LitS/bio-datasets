We demonstrate that AprA, an abundant secreted metalloprotease produced by P. entomophila, is an important virulence factor.	"AprA	20	24	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Inactivation of aprA attenuated both the capacity to persist in the host and pathogenicity.	"aprA	16	20	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
More precisely, our data points to an important role for the antimicrobial peptide Diptericin against orally infectious Gram - negative bacteria, emphasizing the critical role of local antimicrobial peptide expression against food - borne pathogens.

In recent years, Drosophila has emerged as a powerful model for the study of host - pathogen interactions [ 1, 2].	"Drosophila	17	27	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
An attractive feature of the Drosophila system is the existence of multiple defense reactions that are shared with higher organisms [ 3 - 5].	"Drosophila	29	39	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Firstly, epithelia, such as alimentary tract and tracheae, are the first line of defense against pathogens and produce both antimicrobial peptides ( AMPs) and reactive oxygen species.	"reactive oxygen species	159	182	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""reactive oxygen species"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 182, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
In addition, the Imd pathway plays a predominant role in the regulation of AMPs in the alimentary tract and tracheal epithelia [ 7].	"Imd	17	20	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Our knowledge of the Drosophila immune response is mainly based on the analysis of host reactions following direct injection of non - pathogenic bacteria into the insect hemocoel.	"Drosophila	21	31	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Recently we have developed the use of natural oral infection to dissect host responses of Drosophila after challenge with bacteria demonstrated to be infectious for this insect.	"Drosophila	90	100	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We demonstrated that P. entomophila induces both systemic and local immune responses in Drosophila and causes a food - uptake cessation following oral infection in larvae.	"Drosophila	88	98	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Transposon mutagenesis of P. entomophila allowed us to identify several regulatory genes required to infect or to kill Drosophila.	"Drosophila	119	129	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Here we report an in vivo analysis of P. entomophila virulence to both Drosophila larvae and adult flies following natural oral infection.	"Drosophila	71	81	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
To test whether P. entomophila could secrete such toxic factors, a supernatant filtrate from a bacterial culture was tested for its ability to kill Drosophila.	"Drosophila	148	158	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Figure 1A shows that a concentrated P. entomophila culture filtrate had a moderate but significant effect on Drosophila larvae survival following ingestion.	"Drosophila	109	119	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
All of these proteases are members of the zinc metzincin family of Type I - secreted RTX proteins [ 15].	"zinc	42	46	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""zinc"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
We subsequently purified this protease, termed AprA, to homogeneity from the P. entomophila supernatant by anion exchange chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography ( Figure 1D).	"AprA	47	51	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Injection of pure AprA into the hemocoel rapidly killed adult flies, identifying this protein as a bacterial toxin ( Figure 1E).	"AprA	18	22	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Feeding of larvae with high concentrations ( 1. 5 mg / ml) of AprA led to modest lethality ( unpublished data), recapitulating the properties of the P. entomophila supernatant.	"AprA	62	66	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The P. entomophila aprA Mutant Displays Attenuated Pathogenicity	"aprA	19	23	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The experiments described above suggested that AprA plays an important in vivo role in P. entomophila virulence.	"AprA	47	51	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To further test this hypothesis, we used a genetic approach by inactivating the aprA gene.	"aprA	80	84	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Sequence analysis of the locus corresponding to aprA revealed a genetic organization characteristic of this class of Type I - secreted proteases [ 14].	"aprA	48	52	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
SDS - PAGE protein profiles of culture supernatants clearly demonstrated the absence of the 51 - kDa band, and in vitro protease activity of the aprA mutant confirmed the concomitant absence of secreted protease activity ( Figure 1C, lane 6, and 1F).	"aprA	145	149	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Similarly, the aprA mutant showed reduced pathogenicity after oral infection of adult flies ( Figure S1).	"aprA	15	19	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We next compared persistence of wild - type P. entomophila and the aprA mutant by quantifying the number of bacteria in larvae and adults at different time points after infection.	"aprA	67	71	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Whereas the wild - type P. entomophila titer remained high, aprA bacterial levels decreased significantly with time ( Figure 3A, not shown for larvae).	"aprA	60	64	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In support of this hypothesis, previous studies have demonstrated for both Serratia marcescens and P. fluorescens that Type I transporters can be polyvalent and secrete different types of proteins such as proteases and lipases [ 18, 19].	"Serratia marcescens	75	94	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Serratia marcescens"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These data confirmed that the protease AprA itself contributes to P. entomophila virulence.	"AprA	39	43	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The aprA Mutant Retains the Capacity to Trigger an Immune Response and to Induce Food - Uptake Cessation	"aprA	4	8	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The kinetics of the expression of the AMP, Diptericin, in larvae and adults after natural infection by P. entomophila and its derivative mutants, was analyzed by real time quantitative PCR ( RT - qPCR).	"Diptericin	43	53	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Diptericin"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To investigate the connection between activation of the Imd pathway and the outcome of P. entomophila infection in more detail, we focused our analysis on the adult stage when it is easier to monitor survival.	"Imd	56	59	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
P. entomophila infection triggers Imd pathway activation within hours.	"Imd	34	37	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This experiment indicates that P. entomophila can be eliminated when the Imd pathway is activated at a high level prior to infection.	"Imd	73	76	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Since P. entomophila is pathogenic under normal wild - type conditions, it may overcome the immune response by establishing a niche in the gut before the Imd pathway is activated.	"Imd	154	157	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The rationale behind this experiment is based on previous observations that an oral infection with Ecc15 triggers a local, but not a systemic immune response at the adult stage ( our unpublished data) [ 8].	"Ecc15	99	104	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Ecc15"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We used the evf - deficient derivative because this bacterium triggers a local immune response without persisting in the gut.	"evf	12	15	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""evf"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This demonstrates that the protection was indeed due to Imd pathway activation in the gut.	"Imd	56	59	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Over - expression of Imd in the gut protected against P. entomophila, whereas its activation in the fat body did not ( Figure S2).	"Imd	21	24	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, the previous results did not address whether the Imd pathway induced during the course of a natural P. entomophila infection contributes to fly resistance to P. entomophila.	"Imd	58	61	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In these flies, the Imd pathway was not constitutively active in the gut but could be induced upon oral bacterial infection similarly to the wild - type situation ( Figure S3A).	"Imd	20	23	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It has also been suggested that proteases homologous to AprA in other bacterial species degrade AMPs in vitro, thereby enabling pathogens to withstand the attack of the host immune system [ 20, 21].	"AprA	56	60	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This experiment demonstrates that these AMPs can confer protection against P. entomophila and is in good agreement with a previous study showing that Attacin is the most potent AMP against Gram - negative bacteria [ 22].	"Attacin	150	157	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Attacin"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Importantly, it also reveals for the first time a major contribution of Diptericin to host defense, which was not previously detected using systemic injection of microbes [ 22].	"Diptericin	72	82	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Diptericin"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
No effect could be detected when Attacin A was over - expressed in agreement with the bacteriostatic mode of action of this AMP ( unpublished data).	"Attacin A	33	42	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Attacin A"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To study how flies deal with infections in a natural context, we investigated the interactions between Drosophila and a newly identified entomopathogen, P. entomophila.	"Drosophila	103	113	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The precise relevance of this local immune response in Drosophila has not been established to date.	"Drosophila	55	65	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The present study demonstrates a key role for the local Imd immune response in the gut against oral infection by bacterial pathogens.	"Imd	56	59	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To explore the potential implication of AMPs in the Imd immune defense against oral infection by P. entomophila, we compared survival of flies expressing only a single AMP.	"Imd	52	55	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Previous studies revealed only a modest contribution of Diptericin to resistance against Gram - negative bacteria during systemic infection [ 22].	"Diptericin	56	66	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Diptericin"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In contrast, our data reveal that Diptericin plays an essential role in the defense against Gram - negative bacteria when they are ingested.	"Diptericin	34	44	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Diptericin"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The antibacterial activity of Diptericin may be enhanced in the gut by pH and other factors such as lysozymes [ 24].	"Diptericin	30	40	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Diptericin"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This can be compared with many human pathogens for which activation of an inflammatory response represents a part of their invasive strategy [ 25].	"human	31	36	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
AprA Protects P. entomophila from Antibacterial Peptides	"AprA	0	4	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, our approach focusing on both host and pathogen is the first to clearly demonstrate a key role of the AprA metalloprotease in the protection against AMPs in vivo.	"AprA	108	112	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Altogether, our study reveals that local AMP expression plays an important role in defense against oral pathogens and that entomopathogens such as P. entomophila can counteract this effect by expressing aprA.	"aprA	203	207	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 203, ""end_span"": 207, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It is interesting to note that S. marcescens, another potent oral pathogen of Drosophila, also expresses a protease that can degrade AMPs in vitro [ 12].	"Drosophila	78	88	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, in the absence of a Serratia protease mutant, the in vivo relevance of the protease is not yet established.	"Serratia protease mutant	29	53	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Serratia protease mutant"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Taken together, this observation and our findings suggest that proteases may represent a common strategy used by Drosophila pathogens to circumvent the potent antimicrobial host defense.	"Drosophila	113	123	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We cannot exclude that AprA degrades other immune effectors or participates directly as a toxic factor by degrading the gut epithelium or the peritrophic matrix.	"AprA	23	27	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The observation that injection of AprA into the hemocoel is lethal to adult flies supports the hypothesis of additional roles for the protease in bacterial pathogenesis.	"AprA	34	38	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Since gacA mutants did not persist in imd - deficient mutant hosts, we speculate that this persistence - promoting factor provides general protection against gut intestinal conditions rather than a specific protection against the fly immune response.

Food - uptake cessation or blockage in insects is induced by several other entomopathogenic bacteria including S. entomophila and Yersinia pestis, enabling persistence in the digestive tract of their insect hosts [ 35, 36].

In S. entomophila, it has been shown that genes encoded by a prophage were responsible for the anti - feeding reaction in its natural insect host, the grass grub Costelytra zealandica larvae [ 35].

Application of this method to Escherichia coli motility identifies 95% of the known flagellar and chemotaxis genes, and reveals three dozen novel loci that, to varying degrees and through diverse mechanisms, affect motility.

This allows us to place the novel genes within the context of signaling and regulatory networks, including the Rcs phosphorelay pathway and the cyclic di - GMP second - messenger system.

The signaling circuit that mediates this behavior terminates at the flagellar machinery, which is synthesized through a sequential hierarchy of gene activation events [ 10] initiated by the expression of the master transcriptional regulator FlhDC.

We also selected for resistance to bacteriophage chi, which is known to infect and lyse cells only when they are motile.	"chi	49	52	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""chi"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We have used a hyperactive Tn5 transposition system with reduced target specificity [ 16] to create a library of approximately 5 x 105 independent transposon insertional mutants in E. coli MG1655.

Although these sugars are absent from tryptone plates, deletion of trg did result in a measurable motility defect ( unpublished data).	"trg	67	70	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""trg"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, of the more than 50 known genes involved, trg is the only false negative under the motility conditions we used.	"trg	53	56	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""trg"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As a complementary approach to determining the components necessary for a functioning flagellum, we designed a simple selection to identify mutants resistant to chi - phage infection.	"chi	161	164	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""chi"", ""start_span"": 161, ""end_span"": 164, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Bacteriophage chi infects E. coli by attaching to and traveling along flagellar filaments [ 24].	"chi	14	17	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""chi"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
CCW flagellar rotation and the correct pattern of grooves on the surface of the flagellum are thought to drive chi - phage down the filament to the surface of the membrane, very similar to how a nut follows the grooves of a rotating bolt [ 25].

As expected, insertional mutations in flagellar genes conferred resistance to chi - phage infection.	"chi	78	81	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""chi"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

Although this observation contradicts earlier studies on swarming in E. coli and S. enterica [ 29], more recent work has shown that chemotaxis mutants are capable of surface motility when the surface of the agar is sprayed with a fine mist of water [ 30], or when the agar concentration of the swarming media is reduced from 0. 6% to 0. 45% [ 31].

Application of microarray - based genetic footprinting to swimming, swarming, and chi - phage selection was effective in identifying nearly all known flagellar and chemotaxis genes.	"chi	82	85	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""chi"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Of these, only the genes encoding RcsD and glucan synthesis proteins had been previously implicated in swimming motility [ 32, 33].	"RcsD	34	38	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RcsD"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The wide functional repertoire of gene products found to affect motility prompted us to examine whether genetic perturbations in these loci affect motility by signaling upstream of the regulatory circuit that controls flagellar biogenesis, resulting in repression of the flhDC flagellar master operon.	"flhDC	271	276	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""flhDC"", ""start_span"": 271, ""end_span"": 276, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The pathway also includes a recently identified outer membrane lipoprotein ( RcsF) that is known to activate the Rcs system [ 37].	"RcsF	77	81	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RcsF"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

yhjH Affects Flagellar Motor Bias	"yhjH	0	4	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""yhjH"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Mutations in yhjH were recently found to impair swimming motility [ 42].	"yhjH	13	17	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""yhjH"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Consistent with this, we found that insertions in yhjH exhibit a high average z - score of + 277 in our enrichment for nonmotile mutants.	"yhjH	50	54	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""yhjH"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Surprisingly, this gene showed a negative z - score of - 8 after bacteriophage chi selection, indicating that this mutant is impaired in swimming motility but may show increased susceptibility to chi - phage infection relative to the wild - type strain.	"chi	79	82	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""chi"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
To further characterize the effect of this mutation on motility, an in - frame deletion of yhjH was constructed.	"yhjH	91	95	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""yhjH"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Electron microscopy of DeltayhjH mutants showed the appearance of flagella, and light microscopy showed vigorous cellular movement ( unpublished data), indicating that the flagella are capable of rotating; still, this mutant exhibited severe impairment in swimming ( Figure 1C).	"DeltayhjH	23	32	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltayhjH"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To determine whether the absence of yhjH alters the direction of flagellar rotation, several functional studies were performed.	"yhjH	36	40	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""yhjH"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Second, while DeltayhjH mutants are impaired in swimming motility, they did not show a measurable defect in swarming ( Figure 6A), which is in agreement with our finding that flagellar motor switching is not critical for swarming.	"DeltayhjH	14	23	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltayhjH"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This finding is consistent with the chi - phage selection results.	"chi	36	39	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""chi"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Together, these results indicate that the yhjH gene product is involved with the frequency of flagellar motor switching, a process that is among the remaining puzzles in bacterial chemotaxis [ 45].

Inversion of fimS by site - specific recombinases alternately connects and disconnects the fimbrial structural genes from their promoter, resulting in a process of phase variation that gives rise to bacteria in either the fimbriate ( phase ON) or afimbriate ( phase OFF) state [ 61].

Towards the global identification of Hfq targets, previous efforts have employed a combination of co - immunoprecipiatation ( co - IP) and or microarray analysis.	"Hfq	37	40	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Hfq"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
[ 10] used high - throughput pyrosequencing ( HTPS) to detect potential targets of an epitope tagged - Hfq protein co - immunoprecipitated with commercially available antibodies, overcoming the limitations of the previous strategy; the need for custom microarrays and specialized antibodies.

In another study [ 27] microarray analysis was used to identify changes in gene expression resulting from lack of Hfq, thus providing potential new target genes for sRNA regulation.	"Hfq	114	117	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Hfq"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Our global analyses revealed that a relatively high percentage of all the annotated Salmonella genes ( > 20%) are regulated post - transcriptionally either directly or indirectly.

The proteins affected represent a broad spectrum of Salmonella proteins required for many biological processes including general metabolism, the translational machinery, stress response, and virulence - assocaited processes as described next.	"Salmonella	52	62	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Examination of the transcript levels of the corresponding genes showed no significant change in mRNA expression levels relative to wildtype, suggesting that Hfq provides most of the control of these pathways for the growth conditions monitored.	"Hfq	157	160	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Hfq"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 160, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Hfq also appears to play a role in the regulation of the translational machinery itself presumably as a feedback mechanism to maintain tight control over the amount of ribosomal synthesis.	"Hfq	0	3	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Hfq"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This suggests that Hfq normally represses translation of these genes under conditions that mimics the intracellular environment ( AMM).	"Hfq	19	22	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Hfq"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

A recent study showed that an Deltahfq mutant that was non - motile exhibited an invasion defect [ 20].	"Deltahfq	30	38	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Deltahfq"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Consistent with this previous study, we observed reduced expression of SPI - 1 invasion proteins and numerous motility proteins in the Deltahfq mutant strain primarily in the log phase growth condition compared to the wildtype strain.	"Deltahfq	135	143	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Deltahfq"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This reduction in mRNA expression suggests that Hfq regulates motility and invasion at the transcription level, presumably by modulating one of the upstream regulators.	"Hfq	48	51	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Hfq"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Our efforts presented here support the conclusions of that study and suggest that an even larger number of Salmonella proteins are translationally regulated than the 20% suggested by these authors, when accessed across a larger number of growth conditions.	"Salmonella	107	117	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Taking into account all growth conditions about approximately50% of all observed proteins are regulated by Hfq an astonishingly high number.	"Hfq	107	110	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Hfq"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These results may explain the very high LD50 of the hfq mutant strain ( > 109 i. p.) and its growth defect even in rich media.	"hfq	52	55	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""hfq"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It is interesting to note that in adaptive evolution experiments using a chemostat to continuously alter grow conditions often results in changes in Hfq ( Bernard Palsson, UCSD, personal communication).

Isolation of bacterial transcripts induced in Rhizotrogus majalis To isolate bacterial genes induced upon infection, total RNA was isolated from live grubs at 24 h post injection with P. temperata or X. koppenhoeferi, as well as from 48 h log - phase bacterial cultures grown in Brain Heart Infusion ( BHI) broth that were used to inject R. majalis.

Gene dacC encoding a peptidoglycan synthesis enzyme D - alanyl - D - alanine carboxypeptidase was induced in X. koppenhoeferi but not in P. temperata, implying that peptidoglycan undergoes structural alterations in X. koppenhoeferi that probably add to its fitness when residing in the host.

Among the virulence genes identified in this study, tcaC was identified to be induced in both P. temperata and X. koppenhoeferi during infection of R. majalis.	"tcaC	52	56	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""tcaC"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Upregulation of gene sctL, encoding components of type III secretion machinery, possibly coordinates protein secretion system in P. temperata for translocating effector molecules across the bacterial cell envelope into host cells [ 38 - 40].

Indeed, the pathway analysis reveals that def gene product interacts with CysS, a cysteinyl - tRNA synthetase ( see Additional file 1), also suggesting the requirement for cysteine in P. temperata during infection.

Also supported by the pathway analysis, product of glnD identified from P. temperata likely controls the production of siderophore ( see Additional file 1).	"glnD	51	55	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""glnD"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In addition to ion scavenging systems, artM, encoding a putative ABC amino acid transport system [ 63] was identified in P. temperata, but not in X. koppenhoeferi.	"artM	39	43	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""artM"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Besides transporting L - arginine across the inner membrane [ 63], the pathway network reveals that the product of artM participates in cystine transport ( see Additional file 1), suggesting that this gene may also mediate cystine amino acid acquisition.

Upregulation of artM in P. temperata also suggests that amino acids may be available for uptake in the insect.	"artM	16	20	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""artM"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Similarly, it has been discussed previously that histidine and phosphatidylethanolamine, the possible components presented in the insect host hemolymph, may be important food sources used by P. luminescens for growth within the insect host [ 64].

As cysteine synthesis gene cysK was also identified from P. temperata as discussed above, it may indicate that the level of cysteine either synthesized by P. temperata or acquired from the insect host is not sufficient during infection.

Orthologous genes ancestral to both species but regulated by SsrB in S. enterica provide evidence for network expansion and regulatory evolution that we previously showed can be mapped to a single cis - input location by using functional and comparative genomics [ 19].

We identified variations of this motif within footprinted regions of SsrB - regulated promoters [ 25],, however sequence degeneracy made it difficult to precisely map the input functions.	"SsrB	69	73	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Highly conserved sites within the promoters were restricted to regions previously footprinted by SsrB [ 25], [ 26], whereas adjacent sequence showed substantial drift ( Figure 4C).	"SsrB	97	101	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This palindrome was found in all SPI - 2 and SSR - 3 T3SS promoters with the exception of the sseA promoter that had only one reasonably well - conserved heptamer in the footprinted region ( Figure 4C and Figure S1).

Evaluation of the heptamer motif in the palindrome showed high similarity to the motifs identified by the bacterial one - hybrid screen and the ChIP - on - chip experiments ( Figure 4B and 4D), giving us confidence that we had identified the major recognition module for transcriptional input by SsrB.

The presence of a conserved palindrome sequence in SPI - 2 promoters and in related sequences from the endosymbiont S. glossinidius suggested that regulatory input by SsrB was through a palindrome sequence architecture.	"SsrB	167	171	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 167, ""end_span"": 171, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We chose the ssaG promoter for these experiments because 16 of 18 bases were identical between SPI - 2 and SSR - 3 from S. glossinidius, differing only in the 4 - bp spacer between heptamers ( Figure 4C).	"ssaG	13	17	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ssaG"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We mutated the palindrome in a series of transcriptional reporters that were otherwise identical to the evolved ssaG promoter ( Figure 5A) and promoter activity was compared to that of a wild - type palindrome sequence.

Precise deletion of the entire 18 - bp palindrome lead to approximately10% residual activity in wild - type cells, which was reduced to less than 1% in an ssrB mutant ( Figure 5C).	"ssrB	155	159	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ssrB"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 159, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To determine whether the remaining 10% transcriptional activity was a result of an SsrB - dependent feed - forward mechanism or transcriptional read - through of our chromosomally integrated reporter, we constructed an ectopic deletion reporter.	"SsrB	83	87	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The possibility existed that this modified heptamer, although now weaker in consensus, could still be sufficient for recruitment of a functional form of SsrB when paired with the other wild - type heptamer.

Some of these genes may not be directly regulated by SsrB and will require further experimental investigation.	"SsrB	53	57	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This analysis identified many interactions which have not been previously described and interaction sites within coding regions of genes which may represent non - canonical functions for SsrB.

Other groups have reported the existence of similar numbers of ChIP - on - chip interactions within intragenic regions for other transcription factors [ 35], [ 36] suggesting that this phenomenon is not restricted to SsrB.

In light of the disparate number of microarray genes in comparison to ChIP - on - chip peaks we attempted to generate a more comprehensive picture of the SsrB regulon by combining these data sets at the operon level.	"SsrB	154	158	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In doing so we believe that the nineteen operons containing differentially expressed genes determined by microarray and containing a ChIP - on - chip peak three standard deviations above the mean captured by this analysis represent the genes directly activated by SsrB ( Table 2).

By using a genetic screening strategy together with functional and comparative genomics, we were able to define the essential SsrB regulatory element as being an 18 - bp palindrome with a conserved 7 - 4 - 7 internal organization.

Deletion of the entire palindrome resulted in less than 1% activity in wild - type cells, an equivalent level of activity to those lacking ssrB entirely.	"ssrB	139	143	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ssrB"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

As a result of our mutational analyses we conclude that so long as the orientation of a single heptamer of the palindrome is conserved with respect to the downstream gene, SsrB is tolerant of degeneracy in the adjacent spacer and heptamer sequences.

However, when both bacterial variants were grown at 37degreesC in the enriched Todd Hewitt broth medium, their growth rates were indistinguishable, and the only detectable difference was that AP bacteria were more buoyant in liquid culture compared to WT.

Overall, at the least conservative statistical threshold ( P < 0. 05), the transcription of 557 ( 23. 9%) out of 2, 329 genes probed in the microarrays was significantly perturbed ( up or down, at one or more conditions, Fig. S3) and the only set of contiguous genes that underwent transcriptional changes at all tested conditions is the SpeB operon gene set ( CC4 in Fig. 2).

Although a number of informative studies have compared gene and protein expression in virulent and hypervirulent GAS isolates [ 11], [ 12], [ 13], [ 16], [ 26], [ 27], [ 37], none have captured the transitional state that reflects the dynamics of the bacterial struggle to survive in a new host environment.

In vitro, the growth of these two variants of the M1T1 bacteria was comparable and, although 137 ( 5. 9%) of their genes were differentially expressed ( Table 2), in vitro phenotypic screening revealed negligible differences ( Table 1).

This finding is in agreement with studies showing that the CovRS system is mainly linked to the regulation of virulence factors and virulence - associated pathways [ 19], [ 20], [ 24], [ 26], [ 27], [ 28], [ 52], [ 53], [ 54], [ 55].

Whereas SpeB expression may be important in the initial stages of skin infections [ 29], [ 35], its downregulation has been associated with an invasive and hypervirulent phenotype [ 13], [ 14], [ 59].

Their downregulation in AP is thus consistent with the hypothesis that this hypervirulent variant is adapted for deep infection.	"AP	24	26	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In vivo, both WT and AP bacteria downregulated a substantial number of their genes ( 127 genes in CC1 and CC2, Fig. 2 and Table S1), and upregulated many fewer ( 24 genes in CC3, Fig. 2 and Table S1).

Many of the in vivo changes that both the WT and AP bacteria underwent are suggestive of major metabolic reprogramming associated with the transition from a saprophytic lifestyle in the carbohydrate - rich laboratory culture medium to a parasitic lifestyle in the vascularized and the anaerobic subcutaneous environments rich in peptides, amino acids, nucleotides, and different types of complex carbohydrates.

For example, the in vitro microarray results are consistent with our previous proteomic studies of the WT and AP secreted bacterial proteomes [ 12] as well as with other recently published studies of the in vitro transcriptome of closely related strains [ 13], [ 26], [ 27].

Importantly, we did not base our analysis on single measurements of gene expression, nor did we focus on individual genes; rather, we used gene expression data from biological replicates to rule out biological variability ( especially between bacteria recovered from different mice) and to look for changes in gene clusters, operons, and pathways.

We believe that this approach provided more confidence in the final assessment of which genes / pathways were expressed similarly or differentially in both WT and AP bacteria in vitro and in vivo.

Having used multiple strategies and integrated the PM data with the in vitro and in vivo microarray data, we propose the following hypotheses about streptococcal niche adaptation and switch to hypervirulence: ( 1) Exposure to the in vivo environment perturbs a substantial number of GAS genes and regulatory networks.

In fact, WT bacteria underwent the most dramatic in vivo transcriptional reprogramming ( Table 2); yet, they failed to survive since after five to seven days post - infection, they became extinct, and only AP bacteria could be isolated from the mice chambers [ 16].

However, the CovRS system is a major player, among these regulators, in driving the bacterial adaptation to the host ' s environment and regulating virulence directly or through other downstream regulators [ 20], [ 54].
