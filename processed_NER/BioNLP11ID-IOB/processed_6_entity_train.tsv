This same report provided the first experimental evidence supporting the sortase prediction, indicating that the gene product of spy0129 is responsible for the cell - wall sorting of the proteins encoded by both spy0128 ( annotated as a Cpa homolog [ 50]) and spy0130 ( annotated as a protein F homolog [ 14]).

However, as previously observed in complementation studies of BCG [ 18], the level of virulence displayed by the phoP complemented H37Ra strain was still substantially below that of wild - type H37Rv, arguing that the strong attenuation of the H37Ra strain is likely based on several different genetic lesions, such as the one responsible for the absence of phthiocerol dimycocerosates ( PDIM) [ 29], that were probably introduced into this strain during years of continued culture following the original event of attenuation described by Steenken et al. in 1934 [ 6].

Together, the results indicate that i) M. tuberculosis Rv2623 regulates mycobacterial growth in vitro and in vivo, and ii) Rv2623 is required for the entry of the tubercle bacillus into the chronic phase of infection in the host; in addition, iii) Rv2623 binds ATP; and iv) the growth - regulatory attribute of this USP is dependent on its ATP - binding activity.

Later studies demonstrated that the BvrR / BvrS system regulates transcription of at least two major outer membrane proteins, Omp22 ( Omp3b) and Omp25a ( Omp3a).

Ten of these genes, including malK, malG, malF, malE and an iclR regulator, were down - regulated suggesting that the complete operon was negatively regulated in the bvrR mutant.

According to this, it has been demonstrated that in A. tumefaciens the pckA genes is indeed under the control of ChvG / ChvI [ 16] and that null mutants in S. meliloti exoS and chvI have pleiotropic growth defects and were unable to grow on several carbon sources [ 17].

The two - regulatory systems ChvG ( ExoS) / ChvI in S. meliloti and A. tumefaciens posses a high level of identity with the Brucella BvrR / BvrS [ 25], [ 26].

Chaves - Olarte et al have reported that B. abortus bvrS mutant complemented with the ExoS protein recuperated the ability to invade and replicated successfully in HeLa and macrophage cells [ 27], suggesting that the BvrR / BvrS system is functionally interchangeable with the ExoS / ChvI system.

It has been described in S. meliloti that exoR gene encodes a global regulator of transcription and that ExoR interacts genetically with both ExoS and ChvI and inhibits ExoS / ChvI activity [ 29], [ 30].

The type - 1 Mac, such as M1 Mac produced by serotype M1 GAS strains, has high enzymatic activity and low affinity to Fc receptor on the surface of PMNs, while the type - 2 Mac can bind to the Fc receptor and has lower enzymatic activity [ 9].

SeMac or GAS Mac cleaved a small portion of the IgG1 / IgG4 mixture, but not IgG4.	"SeMac	0	5	Protein"	"GAS	9	12	Organism"	"Mac	13	16	Protein"	"IgG1	48	52	Protein"	"IgG4	55	59	Protein"	"IgG4	77	81	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SeMac"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GAS"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Mac"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IgG1"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IgG4"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IgG4"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
If this is true, SeMac should inhibit opsonophagocytosis of GAS by human PMNs, since SeMac efficiently cleaves human IgG.	"SeMac	17	22	Protein"	"GAS	60	63	Organism"	"human	67	72	Organism"	"SeMac	85	90	Protein"	"human	111	116	Organism"	"IgG	117	120	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SeMac"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GAS"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""SeMac"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""IgG"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, there is a correlation between the enzymatic activity of SeMac and its ability to inhibit opsonophagocytosis, suggesting that SeMac functions like GAS M1 Mac in the inhibition of opsonophagocytosis of GAS by human PMNs.
