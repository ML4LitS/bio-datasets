The Toll pathway is mainly activated by Gram - positive bacteria and fungi, and controls, to a large extent, the expression of AMPs ( e. g., Drosomycin) through the nuclear factor - kappaB transactivators Dif and Dorsal.

In contrast, the Imd pathway mainly responds to Gram - negative bacterial infections and controls different AMP genes ( e. g., Diptericin) via the activation of the nuclear factor - kappaB transactivator Relish ( Rel) [ 3, 4, 6].

Interestingly, both prtR mutants ( CL25 and CU1) displayed a secreted protein profile identical to the wild - type strain except for a marked decrease of AprA ( Figure 1C, lanes 4 and 5).	"prtR	20	24	Protein"	"CL25	35	39	Organism"	"CU1	44	47	Organism"	"AprA	154	158	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""prtR"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CL25"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""CU1"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Studies in other bacteria have shown that AprD, E, and F participate in the elaboration of a Type I transporter required for AprA secretion to the external medium [ 17].	"AprD	42	46	Protein"	"E	48	49	Protein"	"F	55	56	Protein"	"AprA	125	129	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AprD"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""E"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""F"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Using the same assay, both prtR and gacA mutants were almost avirulent toward Drosophila indicating that both genes regulate other virulence factors in addition to AprA ( Figure 2B).	"prtR	27	31	Protein"	"gacA	36	40	Protein"	"Drosophila	78	88	Organism"	"AprA	164	168	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""prtR"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 168, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Diptericin was expressed at a wild - type level following oral infection with the aprA and prtR mutants, but no expression was detected in the case of the gacA mutant ( Figures 2C and 5A).	"Diptericin	0	10	Protein"	"aprA	82	86	Protein"	"prtR	91	95	Protein"	"gacA	155	159	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Diptericin"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""prtR"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 159, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Our previous study had already revealed that the humoral arm of the Drosophila immune response mediated by the Imd pathway contributes to resistance against orally transmitted P. entomophila, since flies mutated in the Relish ( Rel) gene showed a consistently increased mortality rate [ 9].	"Drosophila	68	78	Organism"	"Imd	111	114	Protein"	"Relish	219	225	Protein"	"Rel	228	231	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Relish"", ""start_span"": 219, ""end_span"": 225, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Rel"", ""start_span"": 228, ""end_span"": 231, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The observation that AprA was required to promote persistence in wild - type flies and larvae but was dispensable in a Rel background, indicates that AprA plays an important role in the protection against the Imd - dependent immune response.	"AprA	21	25	Protein"	"Rel	119	122	Protein"	"AprA	150	154	Protein"	"Imd	209	212	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Rel"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 209, ""end_span"": 212, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Use of Diptericin - GFP or lacZ reporter genes reveals strong Diptericin expression in the proventriculus, an organ that acts as a valve between the oesophagus and the anterior midgut ( Figure 5B).	"Diptericin	7	17	Protein"	"GFP	20	23	Protein"	"lacZ	27	31	Protein"	"Diptericin	62	72	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Diptericin"", ""start_span"": 7, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GFP"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""lacZ"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Diptericin"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To ascertain that the protection was due to Imd pathway activation and not to a competition between P. entomophila and Ecc15, we next monitored resistance to P. entomophila of wild - type and Rel flies orally infected by Ecc15 evf -.	"Imd	44	47	Protein"	"Ecc15	119	124	Organism"	"Rel	192	195	Protein"	"evf	227	230	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Ecc15"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Rel"", ""start_span"": 192, ""end_span"": 195, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""evf"", ""start_span"": 227, ""end_span"": 230, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Ubiquitous expression of Attacin A and Diptericin with the da - Gal4 driver greatly increased the resistance of imd mutant flies ( Figure 6A).

The Imd pathway regulates a large number of immune genes including those encoding AMPs; and two peptides, Diptericin and Attacin, are preferentially synthesized following bacterial infection in the digestive tract of Drosophila [ 7].

In agreement with previous studies, we show that aprA expression in P. entomophila depends on both PrtR and the GacS / GacA system.	"aprA	49	53	Protein"	"PrtR	99	103	Protein"	"GacS	112	116	Protein"	"GacA	119	123	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PrtR"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GacS"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GacA"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Surprisingly, while mutants with deletions of rcsD, sdaC, tatA, and yhjH were impaired in swimming, these mutants swarmed normally ( unpublished data).

Among the loci exhibiting high z - scores after chi - phage selection were the rfa and mdo gene clusters responsible for the structural assembly of lipopolysaccharides ( LPS) and osmoregulated periplasmic glucans ( OPG).	"lipopolysaccharides	148	167	Chemical"	"LPS	170	173	Chemical"	"osmoregulated periplasmic glucans	179	212	Chemical"	"OPG	215	218	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""lipopolysaccharides"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 167, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""LPS"", ""start_span"": 170, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""osmoregulated periplasmic glucans"", ""start_span"": 179, ""end_span"": 212, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""OPG"", ""start_span"": 215, ""end_span"": 218, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
To determine the role of the Rcs signaling pathway in LPS / OPG mediated repression of motility, we disrupted each of the components of the Rcs system in most of our LPS and OPG mutants.	"LPS	54	57	Chemical"	"OPG	60	63	Chemical"	"LPS	166	169	Chemical"	"OPG	174	177	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""LPS"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""OPG"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""LPS"", ""start_span"": 166, ""end_span"": 169, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""OPG"", ""start_span"": 174, ""end_span"": 177, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
However, since functional flagella are a prerequisite for chi - phage infection, we sought to determine whether defects in LPS and OPG affect chi - phage infection directly or whether the observed selection results are primarily due to reduced flagellar expression.	"chi	58	61	Organism"	"LPS	123	126	Chemical"	"OPG	131	134	Chemical"	"chi	142	145	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""chi"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""LPS"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""OPG"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""chi"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
First, chi - phage infectivity assays with DeltayhjH mutants showed comparable levels of infection to cheR mutants ( which exhibit CCW flagellar rotation bias) in contrast to the reduced sensitivity displayed by cheZ mutants ( which have CW flagellar rotation bias), consistent with the z - scores of our chi - phage selection ( Figure 5E).

Based on sequence homology, YhjH, YfgF, and YegE belong to the newly identified and highly prevalent family of proteins that function in the turnover of bis - ( 3 ' - 5 ') - cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate ( c - di - GMP), which is a second messenger involved in the regulation of a wide variety of bacterial behaviors [ 49].	"YhjH	28	32	Protein"	"YfgF	34	38	Protein"	"YegE	44	48	Protein"	"c - di - GMP	215	227	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""YhjH"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""YfgF"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""YegE"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""c - di - GMP"", ""start_span"": 215, ""end_span"": 227, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Based on this observation and because EAL domain proteins function in the degradation of c - di - GMP, we hypothesized that the motility defect of DeltayhjH ( Figure 1C) is a result of increased intracellular levels of c - di - GMP.	"EAL	38	41	Protein"	"c - di - GMP	89	101	Chemical"	"DeltayhjH	147	156	Protein"	"c - di - GMP	219	231	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""EAL"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""c - di - GMP"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""DeltayhjH"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""c - di - GMP"", ""start_span"": 219, ""end_span"": 231, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
YegE and YfgF both contain an EAL domain C - terminal to a GGDEF domain ( Figure 6G).

Based on these observations, we propose that deleting yegE and over - expressing yfgF suppress the motility defect of the DeltayhjH strain by reducing the intracellular levels of c - di - GMP ( Figure 7).	"yegE	54	58	Protein"	"yfgF	81	85	Protein"	"DeltayhjH	122	131	Protein"	"c - di - GMP	179	191	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""yegE"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""yfgF"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""DeltayhjH"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""c - di - GMP"", ""start_span"": 179, ""end_span"": 191, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
It is hypothesized that YcgR undergoes a conformational change upon binding to c - di - GMP, and that the YcgR - c - di - GMP complex impairs motility through a protein - protein interaction with the flagellar motor [ 57].	"YcgR	24	28	Protein"	"c - di - GMP	79	91	Chemical"	"YcgR	106	110	Protein"	"c - di - GMP	113	125	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""YcgR"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""c - di - GMP"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""YcgR"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""c - di - GMP"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Mutations in ycgR were also found to suppress the swarming defect of the DeltayfiR strain ( unpublished data), suggesting that YcgR binds c - di - GMP to affect both swimming and swarming motility.

Our finding that the EnvZ / OmpR signaling pathway mediates motility suppression in high [ NaCl] is consistent with previous work that found phosphorylated OmpR to negatively regulate the expression of flagella by interacting with the promoter region of flhDC [ 66].

However, many, if not most, strains of these species are harmless commensals, with some enterococci being marketed in Europe to alleviate symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and recurrent chronic sinusitis or bronchitis ( Cylactin ( R) and Fargo688 ( R) ( E. faecium) and Symbioflor 1 ( E. faecalis)).

To determine the distribution of the CRISPR1 locus in E. faecalis strains, 16 isolates of various MLST types were tested for the presence ( PCR with primers specific for csn1 and cas1) or absence ( PCR with primers overlapping the junction between EF0672 and EF0673) of the CRISPR1 locus ( Table 2).

Our analysis of this area in OG1RF revealed the presence of an additional 14. 8 kb fragment inserted between the corresponding EF1826 and EF1827 of OG1RF ( confirmed by PCR; results not shown).

Finally, as previously found using PCR, the cpsCDEFGHIJK operon capsule polysaccharide genes [ 37] were confirmed here as missing, although OG1RF carries the cpsA and cpsB genes, which were proposed to be essential for E. faecalis since all strains tested by Hufnagel et al.

The predicted carboxypeptidase ( OG1RF _ 0191) shares 69% similarity over 179 amino acids with EF2297, a membrane - associated D, D - carboxypeptidase encoded by the vanB operon in V583.

However, OG1RF _ 0191 lacks an identifiable transmembrane domain that is important to the VanY function and it is likely, therefore, that this protein may be a soluble D, D - carboxypeptidase / transpeptidase as seen in Streptomyces [ 39] and Actinomadura [ 40], and thus may not be involved in peptidoglycan metabolism.

The OG1RF iol operon appears to be closely related to ones described in Clostridium perfringens [ 44] and Lactobacillus casei [ 45].

Also, the OG1RF operon carries two copies of an iolG - like gene, which encodes inositol 2 - dehydrogenase, the first enzyme of the myo - inositol degradation pathway ( Figure 5).

To survey E. faecalis, also a member of this order, for the presence of the iol operon, 48 isolates with different MLST and / or from various origins ( including OG1RF and V583) were tested for myo - inositol fermentation; 23 of 48 isolates were positive.

Since we did not identify any remnants of the iol operon in V583, it would appear that at least two independent events at the same location differentiate OG1RF and V583, suggesting that it is a hot region for rearrangement.

One of these is an approximately 49 kb fragment with a G + C content of 32. 1% located between an rRNA operon and the homologue in OG1RF of EF1053, replacing 10 tRNA genes present in V583 ( Figure 1).

Two homologous ComDE sensor histidine kinase / response regulators were found in OG1RF, one of which is FsrC / FsrA.

All but 45 of the missing genes are associated with putative mobile elements, such as the entire PAI, the recently described phages 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 [ 31], and the approximately 111 kb area between genes EF2240 and EF2351 ( including the vanB transposon) present in V583.

Mutations in this region have been associated with fusidic acid resistance in Staphylococcus aureus [ 55, 56], and thus the C1368A mutation is likely the cause of the fusidic acid resistance phenotype in OG1RF.

RopB is a GAS transcriptional regulator that has been shown to be essential for expression of SpeB and binds directly to the promoter region of speB [ 23], [ 24].

Further sequencing was performed on the previously described regulators luxS, rofA, ropA and ropB [ 24], [ 39] - [ 41].

Microarray analysis was performed on in vivo - derived RNA from the well characterized GAS strain 5448 and its derivative 5448R -, containing the mutated ropB allele from 5628.

The most strongly down - regulated genes in 5448R - are members of the SpeB operon, as would be expected from the lack of SpeB expression and activity in 5628 ( Fig. 3).

GAS strain 5628R + expressing a full length RopB showed increased virulence compared to the strain 5628 with a truncated RopB ( Figure 4A).

Recently, we and others have found a connection between inactivation of SpeB through mutation in the two - component regulatory system covR / S and development of invasive disease in the murine model [ 37], [ 38].	"SpeB	72	76	Protein"	"covR	135	139	Protein"	"S	142	143	Protein"	"murine	187	193	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""SpeB"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""covR"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""S"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""murine"", ""start_span"": 187, ""end_span"": 193, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This result suggests that covR / S mutations are the predominant method of phenotypic switching in GAS and that ropB mutation is not readily selected for in vivo.	"covR	26	30	Protein"	"S	33	34	Protein"	"GAS	99	102	Organism"	"ropB	112	116	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""covR"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""S"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GAS"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""ropB"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This leads to the conclusion that ropB mutation in 5628 does not represent a similar mechanism to covR / S mutation and may ( a) be an incidental occurrence or ( b) arise secondary to different selection pressures than those associated with the shift to invasive infection.

In addition, the strain 5628RDeltaSpeB expressing an intact RopB but lacking SpeB showed similarly reduced virulence to the strain with a truncated RopB.

In this report we have used global proteomics to directly identify proteins regulated by Hfq or SmpB by comparing protein abundance in the parent and isogenic hfq or smpB mutant.

For example an Deltahfq mutant derivative in the pathogen Salmonella enterica serovars Typhimurium ( Salmonella Typhimurium) was found to attenuate virulence in mice and was impaired in the invasion of non - phagocytic cells [ 20].

Hfq was also reported to be essential for Vibrio cholerae virulence, with sRNAs in conjunction with Hfq suggested as likely critical regulators of Vibrio cholerae pathogenicity [ 21].

Here, we performed sample - matched global proteomics and transcriptional analyses together with cellular assays and animal studies to begin to understand how Hfq and SmpB control Salmonella gene expression at the post - transcriptional level and the role that this may play in Salmonella pathogenesis.

Construction and growth characteristics of mutant and wildtype Salmonella Typhimurium strains Hfq and SmpB are essential for virulence in a variety of pathogenic bacteria including Salmonella Typhimurium [ 20], [ 21], [ 22], [ 25].	"Salmonella Typhimurium	63	85	Organism"	"Hfq	94	97	Protein"	"SmpB	102	106	Protein"	"Salmonella Typhimurium	181	203	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Salmonella Typhimurium"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Hfq"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SmpB"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Salmonella Typhimurium"", ""start_span"": 181, ""end_span"": 203, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Considering that we observe 36% ( 1621 orfs) of the entire Salmonella proteome ( 4450 orfs) and that 50% ( 781 orfs) of this observed proteome ( 1621 orfs) is modulated by Hfq, it would be expected that a significant portion of the unobserved Salmonella proteome ( 2829 orfs) would also be regulated by Hfq, thus our assertion that the approximately20% value may very well represent an underestimation.	"Salmonella	59	69	Organism"	"Hfq	172	175	Protein"	"Salmonella	243	253	Organism"	"Hfq	303	306	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Hfq"", ""start_span"": 172, ""end_span"": 175, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 243, ""end_span"": 253, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Hfq"", ""start_span"": 303, ""end_span"": 306, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Examination of transcript levels using microarray analysis ( > / = 2 - fold change) revealed a more modest effect on Salmonella transcription, with approximately11% ( 492 genes) and approximately8% ( 370 genes) of the Salmonella Typhimurium genome ( 4550 genes; [ 31]) under control of Hfq and SmpB, respectively ( Table S4).

Overall, the transcription data showed fewer discernable patterns of regulation by Hfq or SmpB relative to the proteome analysis, and comparison across all growth conditions revealed little overlap in proteins and transcripts regulated by either Hfq or SmpB ( Figure 3).

These observations are in agreement with the recently suggested role of Hfq in envelope stress based on lacZ translational fusions [ 34] as well as the observation that rpoE is translationally regulated by Hfq [ 10].

This complexity is further magnified by the reported strain - specific differences in the impact of CovS on pathogenesis [ 24], by the finding that phosphorylated CovR has different affinities to different streptococcal promoters [ 21], and by the possibility that CovR promoter binding may be modulated by kinases or phosphatases other than CovS [ 25].

Despite the association between covS mutations and the emergence of the hypervirulent phenotype of M1T1 strains, it is unclear whether this increased virulence can be entirely attributed to the modulation of the CovR regulon or if other networks are also perturbed in vivo directly, indirectly, or independently of the CovRS system.

For transcriptional profiling, we followed a cyclic, two - color design and performed 28 oligonucleotide microarray hybridization experiments representing technical and biological replicates of the four cell states under investigation: WT grown in vitro ( WT - vitro), WT grown in vivo ( WT - vivo), AP grown in vitro ( AP - vitro), and AP grown in vivo ( AP - vivo), Fig.	"AP	300	302	Organism"	"AP	320	322	Organism"	"AP	337	339	Organism"	"AP	356	358	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 300, ""end_span"": 302, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 320, ""end_span"": 322, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 337, ""end_span"": 339, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 356, ""end_span"": 358, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In fact, our in vivo data show that covR itself is downregulated in vivo in both WT and AP strains ( Fig. 2, CC2 and Table S1); however, the SLS operon is upregulated in vivo in WT bacteria, suggesting that its regulation is not solely modulated by CovRS.

On the other hand, genes encoding the fibrinolytic enzyme streptokinase, Ska, a RofA - like transcriptional regulator, several cell division proteins, and some phage proteins were only upregulated when the AP bacteria sensed the in vivo environment ( AP - vivo, Fig. 2, CC10).

Taken together, these results demonstrate how the murine model has allowed us to finely dissect two classes of events affecting GAS sociomicrobiology: those related to reversible transcriptional adaptation and those irreversibly caused by the covS mutation in AP bacteria.

"This finding suggests that AP bacteria are somehow "" pre - adapted "" to invasiveness and, consequently, when injected into mice, they do not undergo much virulence - related changes as they already possess a thicker capsule, lack a functional SpeB, are equipped with surface virulence proteins, and secrete ready - to - use toxins, including the potent DNase, Sda1."

It was demonstrated that both transcription of bac gene and expression of encoded beta - antigen were controlled by Sak189 response regulator, but not Sak188 histidine kinase.

S. agalactiae CsrRS / CovRS demonstrated high similarity with CsrRS / CovRS of S. pyogenes [ 8].

Inactivation of covR in S. agalactiae increased transcription levels of hemolysin cylE gene and C5a peptidase scpB gene, and reduced the level of CAMP factor cfb gene [ 8], [ 9].

The role of DltR / DltS in S. agalactiae virulence was shown by the attenuated virulent properties of dltA and dltR mutant strains in vivo [ 11].

sak188 and sak189 genes were located on putative pathogenicity island [ 13] adjacent to the bac gene encoding for beta - antigen.

Sak188 and Sak189 proteins revealed 78% and 83% similarity with sensor histidine kinase HK06 and DNA - binding response regulator RR06 of S. pneumoniae strains, respectively [ 13], [ 16] - [ 19].

HK06 / RR06 was also important for the ability of pneumococci to adhere to epithelial cells in vitro and to survive and proliferate in an in vivo mouse model [ 22].

PCR analysis of the bac gene positive strains revealed that the presence of bac gene correlated with the presence of sensor histidine kinase gene sak188 and DNA - binding response regulator gene sak189 ( data not shown).

As result, most of human bac gene positive strains showed resistance or intermediate resistance to Em in the standard diffusion disk test, that is in agreement with previous observations demonstrating an increase in Em resistance in S. agalactiae population [ 30], [ 31].

To investigate a functional role of the two - component regulatory system Sak188 / Sak189 in S. agalactiae, the sak188 and sak189 genes were inactivated by insertional mutagenesis ( Fig. 2).	"Sak188	74	80	Protein"	"Sak189	83	89	Protein"	"sak188	112	118	Protein"	"sak189	123	129	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sak188"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Sak189"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak188"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak189"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It was demonstrated that both transcription of bac gene and expression of encoded beta - antigen were controlled by the Sak189 response regulator, but not Sak188 histidine kinase.

Similarly, ATP - binding and Mg2 + - binding sites located at C - terminal end of Sak188, which are essential for phosphorylation, were lost in Sak188 protein due to the mutagenesis.

In S. pneumoniae, inactivation of the response regulator RR06 ( 83% similarity with Sak189), which binds promoter region of cbpA, repressed transcription of the cbpA gene [ 22].

In this study, western blotting and quantitative RT - PCR revealed that DNA - binding response regulator Sak189 is necessary for beta - antigen expression suggesting direct binding of Sak189 with bac gene promoter.	"Sak189	105	111	Protein"	"beta - antigen	129	143	Protein"	"Sak189	184	190	Protein"	"bac	196	199	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sak189"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""beta - antigen"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Sak189"", ""start_span"": 184, ""end_span"": 190, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""bac"", ""start_span"": 196, ""end_span"": 199, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Given that insertional inactivation of sak188 gene does not affect beta - antigen expression, we suggest that beta - antigen expression can be activated independently of Sak188, perhaps through small - molecular - weight phosphodonors such as acetyl phosphate or other noncognate histidine kinases.
