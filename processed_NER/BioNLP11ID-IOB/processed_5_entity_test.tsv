The structural gene for the metalloprotease, aprA, is followed by a gene encoding its periplasmic inhibitor, aprI, and three genes encoding the Type I transporter, aprD, E, and F ( Figure 2A).

We could not exclude that the aprA mutant phenotype was due to polar effects of the insertion in the operon upon expression of apr I, D, E, and F.

To determine whether AprA plays a role in counteracting the Imd - dependent immune response, we compared persistence of wild - type P. entomophila, gacA, and aprA derivatives by quantifying the number of bacteria in Rel flies and larvae.

We utilized an engineered fly line ( UAS - imd, hs - Gal4) over - expressing imd under the control of a heat - shock promoter via the UAS - Gal4 system, which consequently leads to strong expression of Imd - dependent AMP genes.

As opposed to the pleiotropic effects of GacS / GacA, PrtR appears to be a more specific regulator of aprA expression in P. entomophila, reminiscent of aprX regulation in P. fluorescens [ 32].

The Rcs pathway consists of a phosphotransfer protein ( RcsD) that mediates phosphate transfer from a sensor kinase ( RcsC) to a response regulator ( RcsB) that binds DNA with an accessory protein ( RcsA).

We found that deletion of rcsB, rcsD, or rcsF was sufficient to rescue motility in both LPS and OPG mutants ( Figure S6), providing strong evidence that perturbations in these structures repress motility by signaling through the Rcs pathway.

We also observed that sensitivity to chi - phage was higher in rfaI mutants than rfaC mutants, indicating that chi - phage infectivity is directly related to the degree of flhDC expression ( Figures 4, 5B, and 5C).

Tether assays with DeltayhjH DeltacheZ double mutants showed flagellar rotation indistinguishable from cheZ single mutants ( unpublished data), indicating that null mutations in cheZ are epistatic to null mutations in yhjH.

Based on the known antagonistic effects of c - di - GMP on motility [ 52] and by following several lines of reasoning, we hypothesized the dominant enzymatic activities of the GGDEF and EAL domains in YfgF and YegE.

YfiR is predicted to be a periplasmic protein, YfiB shows sequence similarity to outer - membrane porin proteins, and YfiN is a predicted inner - membrane protein with GGDEF and HAMP domains.

The selection results revealed that mutants harboring insertions in five genes ( ompR, envZ, znuA, znuC, and yfiM) were the most abundant.

Ongoing work will determine how the gene products of yfiM, znuA, and znuC contribute to this signaling pathway, either through Envz / OmpR or through a parallel pathway.

However, OG1RF _ 0186 carries fewer repeats than EF2505 while Ace and OG1RF _ 0165 carry more repeats than their counterparts in V583, suggesting that our observation does not fit this hypothesis or that the peptidoglycan depth is not uniform.

OG1RF does not contain homologues of EF2248 - 54 ( carrying instead the iol operon), though it has a novel WxL locus within the 14. 8 kb unique region upstream of the fsr locus ( Additional data file 2).

In addition, PCR verified the presence of iolE and iolR in these strains and in one negative for myo - inositol fermentation, indicating that the iol operon is not unique to OG1RF.

To verify that the iol genes are responsible for the fermentation of myo - inositol in OG1RF, transposon insertion mutants [ 9] in the iolB and iolG2 genes of OG1RF were tested.

In this study we utilize a SpeB - negative M1T1 clinical isolate, 5628, with a naturally occurring mutation in the gene encoding the regulator RopB, to elucidate the role of RopB and SpeB in systemic virulence.

However, SpeB has also been shown to cleave a range of GAS proteins such as the fibrinogen - binding M1 protein [ 14], [ 15], various superantigens [ 16], [ 17], the secreted plasminogen activator streptokinase [ 18] as well as the DNase Sda1 [ 17], and thus possibly interfere with the proven virulence functions of these bacterial factors.

Strain 5628RDeltaSpeB containing a full - length RopB but lacking SpeB also showed reduced virulence, suggesting that the reduced virulence of 5628 may primarily result from the lack of SpeB expression in this strain.

Of note, the additional virulence factors streptokinase and M1 protein, are both up - regulated in covR / S mutant M1T1 strains [ 37], but not in the ropB mutant under investigation in this study.

Phenotype Microarrays show no major nutritional or metabolic differences between wild type and animal - passaged, hypervirulent M1T1 GAS We used Biolog ( R) Phenotype Microarrays ( PM) to screen 1900 different growth conditions, including a large set of different carbon and nitrogen sources, pH values and salt concentrations, as well as different concentrations of various antimicrobial agents ( Fig. S1), and found that both WT and AP GAS have similar growth requirements in vitro with minor differences.

Moreover, we identified a unique cluster, CC7, that includes genes upregulated both in vivo and as a consequence of the covS mutation ( e. g., those encoding M protein, streptolysin O, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide glycohydrolase ( NADGH), Fig. 2, CC7).

The downregulation of GRAB makes biological sense because this protein binds alpha - 2 - macroglobulin in blood [ 60] to protect the bacteria against its own protease, SpeB, and thus the bacteria no longer need to express high levels of GRAB when SpeB is not expressed.

For example, among the downregulated gene sets are those involved in citrate metabolism, arginine degradation, and de novo pyrimidine synthesis; many of those gene sets were previously reported to be perturbed upon blood inoculation and to be controlled by CovR [ 61] and RopB / Rgg [ 38].

Given that insertional inactivation of RR gene results in inactivation of HK gene [ 22] which are co - transcribed ( Fig. 1), the strain with insertionally inactivated sak189 gene can be considered as sak189 / sak188 double mutant strain, while the strain with insertionally inactivated sak188 gene - as sak188 mutant strain.

Comparative analysis of Sak188 and Sak189 amino acid sequences in the wild - type strain 168 / 00 and deduced protein sequences in mutant strains predicted the replacement of 95 amino acids at the C - terminal end of Sak188 protein by 191 amino acids, and replacement of 51 amino acids at the C - terminal end of Sak189 protein by 15 amino acids ( Fig. 5).

Theoretically, in both sak188 mutant strain and sak189 / sak188 double mutant strain, the Sak188 / Sak189 TCS can be inactive.

Thus, we can conclude that sak188 and bac gene are not in the operon, and repression of bac gene transcription in sak189 / sak188 double mutant strain is not due to the polar effect.
