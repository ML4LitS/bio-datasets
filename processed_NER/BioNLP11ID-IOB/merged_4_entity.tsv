Although NIH230slo lost the killing activity for PMN, migration of PMN in response to IL - 8 in a transwell system was not restored in the presence of this mutant ( Figure 4A), thereby, suggesting that severe invasive GAS blocks PMN migration by influence on IL - 8 activity.

A study has demonstrated SLO from invasive GAS lyse PMN [ 27], however this effect is likely due to complement activation by SLO [ 28] or PMN activation [ 29] but not due to cytotoxity of SLO itself as judged by their flow cytometry profiles which are distinct from ours ( Figure 2A).

Recently, we and others have found a connection between inactivation of SpeB through mutation in the two - component regulatory system covR / S and development of invasive disease in the murine model [ 37], [ 38].

Considering that we observe 36% ( 1621 orfs) of the entire Salmonella proteome ( 4450 orfs) and that 50% ( 781 orfs) of this observed proteome ( 1621 orfs) is modulated by Hfq, it would be expected that a significant portion of the unobserved Salmonella proteome ( 2829 orfs) would also be regulated by Hfq, thus our assertion that the approximately20% value may very well represent an underestimation.

Sak188 and Sak189 proteins revealed 78% and 83% similarity with sensor histidine kinase HK06 and DNA - binding response regulator RR06 of S. pneumoniae strains, respectively [ 13], [ 16] - [ 19].

HK06 / RR06 was also important for the ability of pneumococci to adhere to epithelial cells in vitro and to survive and proliferate in an in vivo mouse model [ 22].

PCR analysis of the bac gene positive strains revealed that the presence of bac gene correlated with the presence of sensor histidine kinase gene sak188 and DNA - binding response regulator gene sak189 ( data not shown).	bac,20,23,Protein	bac,76,79,Protein	sak188,146,152,Protein	sak189,195,201,Protein	"[{""token"": ""bac"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""bac"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak188"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak189"", ""start_span"": 195, ""end_span"": 201, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
As result, most of human bac gene positive strains showed resistance or intermediate resistance to Em in the standard diffusion disk test, that is in agreement with previous observations demonstrating an increase in Em resistance in S. agalactiae population [ 30], [ 31].	human,19,24,Organism	bac,25,28,Protein	Em,99,101,Chemical	Em,216,218,Chemical	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""bac"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Em"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""Em"", ""start_span"": 216, ""end_span"": 218, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"	test
To investigate a functional role of the two - component regulatory system Sak188 / Sak189 in S. agalactiae, the sak188 and sak189 genes were inactivated by insertional mutagenesis ( Fig. 2).	Sak188,74,80,Protein	Sak189,83,89,Protein	sak188,112,118,Protein	sak189,123,129,Protein	"[{""token"": ""Sak188"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Sak189"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak188"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak189"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
It was demonstrated that both transcription of bac gene and expression of encoded beta - antigen were controlled by the Sak189 response regulator, but not Sak188 histidine kinase.	bac,47,50,Protein	beta - antigen,82,96,Protein	Sak189,120,126,Protein	Sak188,155,161,Protein	"[{""token"": ""bac"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""beta - antigen"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Sak189"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Sak188"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Similarly, ATP - binding and Mg2 + - binding sites located at C - terminal end of Sak188, which are essential for phosphorylation, were lost in Sak188 protein due to the mutagenesis.

In S. pneumoniae, inactivation of the response regulator RR06 ( 83% similarity with Sak189), which binds promoter region of cbpA, repressed transcription of the cbpA gene [ 22].

In this study, western blotting and quantitative RT - PCR revealed that DNA - binding response regulator Sak189 is necessary for beta - antigen expression suggesting direct binding of Sak189 with bac gene promoter.	Sak189,105,111,Protein	beta - antigen,129,143,Protein	Sak189,184,190,Protein	bac,196,199,Protein	"[{""token"": ""Sak189"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""beta - antigen"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Sak189"", ""start_span"": 184, ""end_span"": 190, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""bac"", ""start_span"": 196, ""end_span"": 199, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Given that insertional inactivation of sak188 gene does not affect beta - antigen expression, we suggest that beta - antigen expression can be activated independently of Sak188, perhaps through small - molecular - weight phosphodonors such as acetyl phosphate or other noncognate histidine kinases.	sak188,39,45,Protein	beta - antigen,67,81,Protein	beta - antigen,110,124,Protein	Sak188,170,176,Protein	"[{""token"": ""sak188"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""beta - antigen"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""beta - antigen"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Sak188"", ""start_span"": 170, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
