CovRS is a two - component regulatory system, in which CovS transduces external signals [ 17], [ 18] to CovR, which in turn represses the transcription of several group A streptococcal ( GAS) virulence gene sets, including the capsule synthesis operon ( hasABC), the streptolysin S operon ( SLS or sagA - H), and the streptokinase gene ( ska) [ 19], [ 20].

For example, the upregulation of Ska, SLO / Nga, and the Has operon is a pattern that reflects the inhibition of CovR repression, whereas the downregulation of both SpeB and SLS operons is a pattern associated with the transcriptional regulator RopB / Rgg [ 47], [ 48] but that may also reflect augmented CovR repression [ 20].
