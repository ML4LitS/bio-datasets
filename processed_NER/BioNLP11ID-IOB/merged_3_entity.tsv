From these experiments we concluded that complementation of H37Ra with the phoP wild - type copy partially restored its virulence, but not to the extent of the fully virulent H37Rv strain.

Together with the data from the macrophage infection assay, the results from the mouse infection show that the S219L mutation in the phoP gene definitely represents one genetic lesion that contributed to the attenuation of the H37Ra strain.	mouse,81,86,Organism	phoP,133,137,Protein	H37Ra,227,232,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 227, ""end_span"": 232, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	train
As PhoP fulfills important regulatory functions in M. tuberculosis [ 21, 22], it was of primary interest to identify and study potential effector molecules whose involvement in host pathogen interaction were influenced by the point mutation in phoP of H37Ra.

The western blot analysis presented in Figure 5 shows that the cell lysates of H37Ra and H37Ra:: rpsL contain large amounts of ESAT - 6, indicating that the antigen is properly expressed.

In contrast, from examination of the western blots of M. tuberculosis H37Ra:: phoP and H37Rv it is clear that a large portion of their ESAT - 6 protein is secreted into the culture filtrates.	phoP,78,82,Protein	H37Rv,87,92,Organism	ESAT - 6,135,143,Protein	"[{""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""H37Rv"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	train

Steenken et al. have shown that the virulence of the H37 strain was associated with colony morphology and that the avirulent variant H37Ra failed to propagate in an ordinarily susceptible host while the virulent variant H37Rv was able to proliferate [ 6].

Finally, microarray - based trancriptome analysis using the wild - type versus a phoP ko mutant of H37Rv has provided an overview of the transcriptional regulation linked to PhoP [ 21].	phoP,81,85,Protein	H37Rv,99,104,Organism	PhoP,174,178,Protein	"[{""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""H37Rv"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""PhoP"", ""start_span"": 174, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	train
This finding argues that the PhoP S219L mutation likely has a broad impact on gene regulation in H37Ra with effects similar to those seen for complete inactivation of phoP.

As in previous DNA / DNA microarray analyses [ 10], and from inspection of the very recently released genome sequence of H37Ra, no significant differences in the ESX - 1 encoding region were found, the assumption that the observed lack of ESAT - 6 secretion in H37Ra may be caused by factors outside of the RD1 region is very plausible.

In contrast, in another transcriptome analysis, Mostowy and colleagues [ 11] found several genes of the RD1 region, including that encoding ESAT - 6, among the genes that were at least 2. 5 - fold lower expressed in H37Ra than in H37Rv.

To investigate this possibility, we introduced flhDC - lacZ translational fusions in the deletion strains and performed beta - galactosidase assays.	flhDC,47,52,Protein	lacZ,55,59,Protein	beta - galactosidase,120,140,Protein	"[{""token"": ""flhDC"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""lacZ"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""beta - galactosidase"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Surprisingly, a large fraction of the mutants tested showed significant reduction in flhDC - lacZ expression values relative to the wild - type strain, demonstrating that the motility defects can be partly attributed to reduced expression of the flhDC operon.	flhDC,85,90,Protein	lacZ,93,97,Protein	flhDC,246,251,Protein	"[{""token"": ""flhDC"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""lacZ"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""flhDC"", ""start_span"": 246, ""end_span"": 251, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
In addition, we noticed that LPS mutants varied widely in flhDC expression and that the repression of this operon, and the corresponding motility defect, were related to the degree of LPS truncation ( Figure 4).

The widespread influence of LPS and OPG mutations on swimming, swarming, and chi - phage infection prompted us to explore the genetic mechanism of these mutations in more detail.

Previous evidence links LPS and OPG mutations to the activation of the Rcs phosphorelay system [ 34, 35], and the Rcs system is known to negatively regulate the flhDC operon [ 36].

An flhD mutant was used as a chi - phage - resistant control and, as expected, showed no sensitivity, whereas chi - phage multiplied rapidly in the presence of the wild - type strain ( Figure 5A).	flhD,3,7,Protein	chi,29,32,Organism	chi,110,113,Organism	"[{""token"": ""flhD"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""chi"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""chi"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
We found that mutants with OPG defects and severe LPS truncations were incapable of swarming and that introducing DeltarcsF deletions into these mutants was sufficient to rescue the phenotype ( Figures 3F and S6).

These data indicate that LPS and OPG are not directly necessary for swarming, and that the behavior exhibited by such mutants results from Rcs - mediated repression of the flhDC operon.

Based on these observations, we hypothesized that this mutant has flagella with an extreme CCW rotation bias, a phenotype also exhibited, to varying degrees, by cheA, cheR, and cheW mutants [ 43].	cheA,161,165,Protein	cheR,167,171,Protein	cheW,177,181,Protein	"[{""token"": ""cheA"", ""start_span"": 161, ""end_span"": 165, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheR"", ""start_span"": 167, ""end_span"": 171, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheW"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 181, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
In a final functional test, individual cells of four different strains - wild - type cells and mutants with yhjH, cheR, and cheZ deletions - were tethered to a microscope slide and the frequency of flagellar rotation switching was measured using computer tracking software in a fashion similar to Block et al.	yhjH,108,112,Protein	cheR,114,118,Protein	cheZ,124,128,Protein	"[{""token"": ""yhjH"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheR"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheZ"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
The other half of DeltayhjH suppressor mutations were found to contain insertions within the intergenic region between the divergently transcribed genes yfgF and yfgG, which encode gene products of unknown function.

However, deletions of either yfgF or yfgG produced no measurable difference in motility in the DeltayhjH background ( Figure S9).	yfgF,29,33,Protein	yfgG,37,41,Protein	DeltayhjH,95,104,Protein	"[{""token"": ""yfgF"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""yfgG"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""DeltayhjH"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Conversely, overexpression of yfgF ( but not yfgG) was found to suppress the motility defect of DeltayhjH mutants ( Figure 6E).	yfgF,30,34,Protein	yfgG,45,49,Protein	DeltayhjH,96,105,Protein	"[{""token"": ""yfgF"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""yfgG"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""DeltayhjH"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
The mechanisms by which deletion of yegE and overexpression of yfgF suppress the motility defect of DeltayhjH mutants are discussed in the next section.	yegE,36,40,Protein	yfgF,63,67,Protein	DeltayhjH,100,109,Protein	"[{""token"": ""yegE"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""yfgF"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""DeltayhjH"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
YhjH contains an EAL domain, and expression of this protein leads to the degradation of c - di - GMP and enhanced motility in S. enterica [ 52].

If c - di - GMP levels act globally and can influence motility, then insertions in many of the genes containing active GGDEF domains should rescue motility in the DeltayhjH double mutant library.	c - di - GMP,3,15,Chemical	GGDEF,119,124,Protein	DeltayhjH,163,172,Protein	"[{""token"": ""c - di - GMP"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""GGDEF"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""DeltayhjH"", ""start_span"": 163, ""end_span"": 172, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
However, it has been reported that c - di - GMP binds to the PilZ domain of the aforementioned YcgR protein [ 48].	c - di - GMP,35,47,Chemical	PilZ,61,65,Protein	YcgR,95,99,Protein	"[{""token"": ""c - di - GMP"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""PilZ"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""YcgR"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Such an interaction may explain the observed rotational bias of flagella in DeltayhjH mutants ( Figure 6B) and is in agreement with our finding that mutations in ycgR strongly suppress the motility defects of DeltayhjH mutants ( Figure 6F).

The observations that the DeltayhjH mutant is impaired in swimming but indistinguishable from the wild - type strain in swarming, while in contrast the DeltayfiR strain cannot swarm and is only mildly impaired in swimming, support the notion that c - di - GMP signaling pathways are temporally and / or spatially separated, as recently suggested by others [ 58, 59].

The fimS mutant exhibited a level of fimbriation similar to fimB - fimE - double mutants locked in phase ON ( Figure S11A), indicating that a high level of fimbriation reduces motility in semi - solid agar.	fimS,4,8,Protein	fimB,60,64,Protein	fimE,67,71,Protein	"[{""token"": ""fimS"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fimB"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fimE"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test

Multilocus sequence typing ( MLST) showed that OG1RF is clonally distinct from V583 ( differs in six out of seven alleles of housekeeping genes) [ 11] and characterization of regions flanking transposon insertions in OG1RF suggested that approximately 10% of their sequences differed [ 12].

To address these issues and improve our understanding of the gene regulatory impact of mutational and adaptive events contributing to the hypervirulent phenotype of M1T1 strains, we analyzed differences in growth requirements, transcriptome profiles, and regulatory circuits of the virulent ( WT) and hypervirulent ( AP) phenotypes of the M1T1 strain both in vitro and during initial in vivo infection.

Minimal media are not optimal for the expression of GAS proteins, which may explain why GAS failed to grow at many of the PM conditions ( Fig. S1) and why fewer phenotypic differences were observed between WT and AP bacteria than transcriptomic differences ( see below).

It is possible that SLS is regulated by the catabolite control protein ( CcpA), which was recently shown to be another key transcriptional regulator of the SLS operon [ 46] and which may override CovR - mediated repression of SLS.

Finally, genes encoding the antiphagocytic M protein, and the toxins streptolysin O and NADGH were among few genes that were upregulated in all conditions except WT - vitro ( Fig. 2, CC7), which suggests that their transcription is dependent on multiple signals, including signals from the host as well as covS - dependent cues.	streptolysin O,69,83,Protein	NADGH,88,93,Protein	covS,306,310,Protein	"[{""token"": ""streptolysin O"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""NADGH"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""covS"", ""start_span"": 306, ""end_span"": 310, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
It is noteworthy that SpeB expression has a dominant effect, since even if secreted in low amounts by a minor subpopulation, this broad - spectrum protease would still be able to degrade, fully or partially, many GAS virulence proteins, including Sda1, thereby rendering the bacteria vulnerable to different effector mechanisms of the host ' s innate immune system including neutrophil killing [ 14], [ 67], [ 68].
