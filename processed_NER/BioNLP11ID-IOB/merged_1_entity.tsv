Closer inspection of biofilm formation by DeltagacS over a period of 144 hr, however, indicated that the biofilm architecture ( seen after 144 hr) was due to accelerated biofilm growth followed by premature disaggregation of biofilms as compared to wild type biofilms.

Continued growth for more than 72 hr, however, resulted in the disaggregation of DeltagacS mutant biofilms as indicated by the presence of large, detached clusters floating in the bulk liquid, and a significantly reduced attached biofilm biomass and biofilm thickness ( Fig. 3, Table 2).

Since P. entomophila is pathogenic under normal wild - type conditions, it may overcome the immune response by establishing a niche in the gut before the Imd pathway is activated.	Imd,154,157,Protein	"[{""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test

We identified variations of this motif within footprinted regions of SsrB - regulated promoters [ 25],, however sequence degeneracy made it difficult to precisely map the input functions.	SsrB,69,73,Protein	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test

Evaluation of the heptamer motif in the palindrome showed high similarity to the motifs identified by the bacterial one - hybrid screen and the ChIP - on - chip experiments ( Figure 4B and 4D), giving us confidence that we had identified the major recognition module for transcriptional input by SsrB.

The presence of a conserved palindrome sequence in SPI - 2 promoters and in related sequences from the endosymbiont S. glossinidius suggested that regulatory input by SsrB was through a palindrome sequence architecture.

We chose the ssaG promoter for these experiments because 16 of 18 bases were identical between SPI - 2 and SSR - 3 from S. glossinidius, differing only in the 4 - bp spacer between heptamers ( Figure 4C).	ssaG,13,17,Protein	"[{""token"": ""ssaG"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test

Precise deletion of the entire 18 - bp palindrome lead to approximately10% residual activity in wild - type cells, which was reduced to less than 1% in an ssrB mutant ( Figure 5C).	ssrB,155,159,Protein	"[{""token"": ""ssrB"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 159, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
To determine whether the remaining 10% transcriptional activity was a result of an SsrB - dependent feed - forward mechanism or transcriptional read - through of our chromosomally integrated reporter, we constructed an ectopic deletion reporter.

Other groups have reported the existence of similar numbers of ChIP - on - chip interactions within intragenic regions for other transcription factors [ 35], [ 36] suggesting that this phenomenon is not restricted to SsrB.

In light of the disparate number of microarray genes in comparison to ChIP - on - chip peaks we attempted to generate a more comprehensive picture of the SsrB regulon by combining these data sets at the operon level.	SsrB,154,158,Protein	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
In doing so we believe that the nineteen operons containing differentially expressed genes determined by microarray and containing a ChIP - on - chip peak three standard deviations above the mean captured by this analysis represent the genes directly activated by SsrB ( Table 2).

Those operons having a ChIP - on - chip peak directly upstream in the IGR region encompass the majority of known SsrB regulated genes while those possessing a ChIP peak within the CDS of the first gene may represent non - functional interactions that deserve follow - up experimental investigation.

By using a genetic screening strategy together with functional and comparative genomics, we were able to define the essential SsrB regulatory element as being an 18 - bp palindrome with a conserved 7 - 4 - 7 internal organization.

Deletion of the entire palindrome resulted in less than 1% activity in wild - type cells, an equivalent level of activity to those lacking ssrB entirely.	ssrB,139,143,Protein	"[{""token"": ""ssrB"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Although palindrome architecture was conserved upstream of SsrB - regulated genes, degenerate palindromes in which one half - site was more conserved were also functional.	SsrB,59,63,Protein	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
As a result of our mutational analyses we conclude that so long as the orientation of a single heptamer of the palindrome is conserved with respect to the downstream gene, SsrB is tolerant of degeneracy in the adjacent spacer and heptamer sequences.

This suggests that the majority of in vitro vs. in vivo differentially expressed genes between the WT and AP variants may be involved in niche adaptation.	AP,106,108,Organism	"[{""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
This finding is in agreement with studies showing that the CovRS system is mainly linked to the regulation of virulence factors and virulence - associated pathways [ 19], [ 20], [ 24], [ 26], [ 27], [ 28], [ 52], [ 53], [ 54], [ 55].

Whereas SpeB expression may be important in the initial stages of skin infections [ 29], [ 35], its downregulation has been associated with an invasive and hypervirulent phenotype [ 13], [ 14], [ 59].

Their downregulation in AP is thus consistent with the hypothesis that this hypervirulent variant is adapted for deep infection.	AP,24,26,Organism	"[{""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
In vivo, both WT and AP bacteria downregulated a substantial number of their genes ( 127 genes in CC1 and CC2, Fig. 2 and Table S1), and upregulated many fewer ( 24 genes in CC3, Fig. 2 and Table S1).

Many of the in vivo changes that both the WT and AP bacteria underwent are suggestive of major metabolic reprogramming associated with the transition from a saprophytic lifestyle in the carbohydrate - rich laboratory culture medium to a parasitic lifestyle in the vascularized and the anaerobic subcutaneous environments rich in peptides, amino acids, nucleotides, and different types of complex carbohydrates.

For example, the in vitro microarray results are consistent with our previous proteomic studies of the WT and AP secreted bacterial proteomes [ 12] as well as with other recently published studies of the in vitro transcriptome of closely related strains [ 13], [ 26], [ 27].

Importantly, we did not base our analysis on single measurements of gene expression, nor did we focus on individual genes; rather, we used gene expression data from biological replicates to rule out biological variability ( especially between bacteria recovered from different mice) and to look for changes in gene clusters, operons, and pathways.	mice,277,281,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 277, ""end_span"": 281, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
We believe that this approach provided more confidence in the final assessment of which genes / pathways were expressed similarly or differentially in both WT and AP bacteria in vitro and in vivo.

Having used multiple strategies and integrated the PM data with the in vitro and in vivo microarray data, we propose the following hypotheses about streptococcal niche adaptation and switch to hypervirulence: ( 1) Exposure to the in vivo environment perturbs a substantial number of GAS genes and regulatory networks.

In fact, WT bacteria underwent the most dramatic in vivo transcriptional reprogramming ( Table 2); yet, they failed to survive since after five to seven days post - infection, they became extinct, and only AP bacteria could be isolated from the mice chambers [ 16].	mice,245,249,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 245, ""end_span"": 249, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test

However, the CovRS system is a major player, among these regulators, in driving the bacterial adaptation to the host ' s environment and regulating virulence directly or through other downstream regulators [ 20], [ 54].

In conclusion, we have established a model that allowed us to resolve two sets of complex transcriptional events: ( i) those occurring in response to the host environment and ( ii) those caused by a mutation in covS sensor kinase.	covS,211,215,Protein	"[{""token"": ""covS"", ""start_span"": 211, ""end_span"": 215, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
