We used oligonucleotide microarrays to monitor ( in vitro) differential gene expression in group A streptococci during pharyngeal cell adherence, the first overt infection stage.

Neighbor clustering provides a more comprehensive view of the molecular responses of streptococci during pharyngeal cell adherence.	"streptococci	85	97	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""streptococci"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The ability of all bacterial pathogens to infect the human host depends upon coordinated regulation of diverse gene sets that are required for survival in host environments.	"human	53	58	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Although recent microarray studies have highlighted the molecular responses of streptococci in relevant host conditions [ 8 - 10], characterizing differentially expressed loci during pharyngeal cell adherence is critical for understanding the molecular basis for host colonization.	"streptococci	79	91	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""streptococci"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Although the mechanisms mediating these responses are not known, the results of these studies indicate that streptococci sense and, on a transcriptional level, respond to various signals and cues in the pharyngeal cell environment.

Streptococci elaborate several factors implicated in infection, including surface - exposed adhesins and secreted toxigenic proteins ( reviewed in [ 7, 14, 24]).	"Streptococci	0	12	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Streptococci"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The resulting cellular damage, particularly to polymorphonuclear leukocytes [ 26], decreases internalization and subsequent intracellular killing of streptococci [ 27].	"streptococci	149	161	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""streptococci"", ""start_span"": 149, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, once adhered, our data suggest that streptococci downregulate production of this cytotoxin, presumably to prevent further host tissue destruction that could interfere with adherence.	"streptococci	45	57	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""streptococci"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The protein shares 60% sequence similarity to protein F, suggesting that it may coordinate a similar internalization mechanism or may be involved directly in adherence ( discussed later in detail).	"protein F	46	55	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""protein F"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
SpeB downregulation also coincides with increased expression of pyrogenic exotoxins [ 33, 37] that reportedly increase streptococcal survival in vivo.	"SpeB	0	4	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SpeB"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We observed that the exotoxin - encoding speH gene [ 38] was upregulated.	"speH	41	45	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""speH"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Taken together, our results agree with previous reports on SpeB production during host cell interactions, suggesting that decreased expression may promote streptococcal adherence ( by preventing proteolytic degradation of key virulence factors or adhesins), enhance internalization ( perhaps through a fibronectin - mediated pathway), and increase survival ( through increased pyrogenic exotoxin production, discussed below).

SF370 contains one inducible prophage ( 370. 1) and three defective prophages ( 370. 2, 370. 3, and 370. 4) that produce no infectious phage [ 39].	"SF370	0	5	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""SF370"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

Adherence - mediated upregulation of speH is likely not the result of phage induction, as the remaining phage 370. 2 genes identified in our analysis were downregulated.	"speH	37	41	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""speH"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The significant upregulation of the speH gene during adherence suggests that the gene product may function instead during a subsequent stage of infection.	"speH	36	40	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""speH"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
For example, genes encoding proteins involved in folate biosynthesis [ 40] were upregulated, suggesting that certain cofactors that may be necessary during adherence were unavailable.	"folate	49	55	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""folate"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Also upregulated were genes encoding subunits of the F0F1 ATPase [ 41] ( discussed in more detail later), which may indicate an acid stress response to maintain cytoplasmic pH or a need to generate ATP in response to increased energy requirements.	"ATP	58	61	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""ATP"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
However, despite a rigorous statistical approach, this analysis, like many previous microarray studies, identified the differential expression of a large number of unknown genes ( n = 21) and a number of incomplete biological pathways ( e. g., F0F1 ATPase [ 41] and folate biosynthesis [ 40]) by failing to detect the differential expression of a number of known gene pathway members ( Table 1).

Adherence - induced downregulation of streptolysin S is consistent with its previously determined role in host cell internalization [ 25]; however, without neighbor clustering, expression of this operon was not evident immediately.

If transcription is internally disrupted by such a terminator, the abundance of the sagA transcript may be much greater than the polycistronic message; such disproportionate transcript levels would affect log2 - fold change values and impact the statistical significance of individual genes within these types of clusters.

A search of both the PFAM database [ 47] ( http: / / pfam. wustl. edu) and sortase database ( http: / / www. doe - mbi. ucla. edu / Services / Sortase) predicted that spy0129 encodes a sortase enzyme, which are transpeptidases that cleave protein substrates at conserved C - terminal motifs ( often LPXTG) and then anchor these proteins to the bacterial cell wall [ 48, 49].

Reverse transcription of SF370 RNA, with primer combinations that spanned all four genes, produced cDNA fragments of sizes that could only result from a polycistronic mRNA template ( Figure 3).

Although GenomeCrawler is not an operon - identifying algorithm, these results show that it could ( 1) identify this commonly regulated gene cluster and ( 2) define the cluster boundaries, excluding other proximate genes, such as an additional sortase - encoding gene, spy0135.

Because the gene cluster is also an operon, expression of the downstream gene spy0130, encoding the protein F homolog / pilus protein, was also eliminated in this mutant ( Figure 4A).	"spy0130	78	85	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""spy0130"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Because the spy0129 gene product is not expected to be found on the streptococcal surface ( i. e., it lacks a cell - wall anchoring motif), it is not likely to be involved directly in adherence.

Although biological testing of every identified gene or cluster is unrealistic, we provided evidence, through the creation and testing of isogenic deletion mutants and through the identification of clusters of known, functionally related genes from a published streptococcal array study, that the algorithms produce results that are pertinent to the biology of streptococci.

The FimA protein is required for P. gingivalis colonization on salivary coated surfaces, and the early colonization of dental plaque ( Malek et al., 1994; Levesque et al., 2003; Maeda et al., 2004).

The RACE experiment was first conducted with mfa1 - specific reverse primers MfaTSR1 located at 135 bp up - stream of the potential start codon and MfaTSR2 located at 37 bp downstream of the potential start codon ( Fig. 2a).

Cold competitor chase experiments with a 100 - fold excess of unlabeled DNA probe as a specific competitor were also used to demonstrate the specificity of rFimR binding.	"rFimR	156	161	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""rFimR"", ""start_span"": 156, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

However, the possibility cannot be excluded that other regulatory elements are also involved in expression of the mfa1 gene.	"mfa1	114	118	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""mfa1"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

The fact that FimR was not activated by phosphorylation may also be due to the short lifetime of the phosphorylated state, which has been observed in other bacteria ( Stock et al., 2000).	"FimR	14	18	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FimR"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The transcriptional start site of the mfa1 gene located at 434 bp upstream of the putative start codon was detected, which is also 390 bp upstream of the site previously reported ( Park et al., 2006).

Data of this study suggest that transcription of the mfa1 gene originated at a distal upstream transcriptional start site and read through the promoter region suggested by Park et al.	"mfa1	53	57	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""mfa1"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

The lack of these protein domains in P. luminescens reveals that c - di - GMP signalling plays a major role in pathogenic bacteria when colonizing a mammalian host, and a minor for invertebrate colonization of entomopathogenic or entomoinfecting bacteria.

Further experiments supported the hypothesis that TccC - like proteins might act as universal activators of, or chaperons for, different toxin proteins, while Tca - like and Tcd - like proteins contribute predominantly to the oral toxicity of bacterial supernatants [ 17].

Because there is no counterpart of Yts1 present in P. luminescens, one can speculate that the major parts of type - II dependent secreted proteins which are important for insect association of Y. enterocolitica are translocated via the Sec system.

It also indicates that iron acquisition is a prerequisite for the infection process of pathogenic bacteria not only in mammalian, but also in invertebrate hosts, and underlines the suggestion that genetic determinants of invertebrate pathogens such as P. luminescens include the progenitors of virulence factors against vertebrates [ 79, 106].

Another example that might enlighten the evolution of bacterial pathogenicity is the plasticity zone ( PZ) of Y. enterocolitica, a 199 kb key locus for high pathogenicity that includes YAPIYe, secretion systems, hydrogenase loci essential for gut colonization of S. typhimurium and H. pylori [ 122], and iron acquisition systems.

Only few other genes or operons of the PZ are also present in P. luminescens, namely a chitinase, two iron acquisition systems, and three ysa genes, thus confirming the idea of a patchwork of horizontally acquired genes within the PZ [ 23].

DeltagacS mutant biofilms were significantly thicker than wild type biofilms following 1 and 72 hr of growth under flowing conditions, forming microcolonies and clusters exceeding 150 microm in diameter ( Fig. 3).	"DeltagacS	0	9	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltagacS"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
At both time points, DeltagacS biofilms not only exceeded the average microcolony size typically seen for wild type biofilms of the same age, but also the biomass and thickness of wild type biofilms at more mature ages ( Fig. 3, Table 2).	"DeltagacS	21	30	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltagacS"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Continued growth for more than 72 hr, however, resulted in the disaggregation of DeltagacS mutant biofilms as indicated by the presence of large, detached clusters floating in the bulk liquid, and a significantly reduced attached biofilm biomass and biofilm thickness ( Fig. 3, Table 2).	"DeltagacS	81	90	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltagacS"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, while growth of DeltagacS mutant biofilms following 24 hr post attachment was accelerated ( Fig. 3), initial attachment was significantly reduced in this mutant ( not shown).	"DeltagacS	22	31	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltagacS"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In addition, both mutant biofilms lacked evidence for MifR phosphorylation ( phosphorylated following 72 hr of wild type growth, Table 1, Suppl. Fig. S3).	"MifR	54	58	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MifR"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Instead, DeltabfiS biofilms exhibited stage - specific phosphorylation events typically detected in 8 - hr - and 24 - hr - old wild type biofilms: the Ser / Thr phosphoproteome contained 15 out of 23 phosphorylated proteins and 2 out of 21 phosphorylated proteins that are specific for 8 - hr - and 24 - hr - old wild type biofilms, respectively ( see Fig. 1, Suppl. Table S2).	"DeltabfiS	9	18	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltabfiS"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Similarly, the phosphorylation patterns of DeltabfmR biofilms indicated the presence of 24 - and 72 - hr stage - specific phosphorylated proteins ( not shown).	"DeltabfmR	43	52	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltabfmR"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The phosphorylation patterns of 144 - hr - old DeltamifR biofilms were 62% different relative to planktonic cells, but only shared 58% similarity with mature, 144 - hr - old wild type biofilms ( Fig. 4A).	"DeltamifR	47	56	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltamifR"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore, DeltamifR biofilms exhibited 8 out of 27 maturation - 1 specific protein phosphorylation events, and only 16 out of 37 maturation - 2 phosphorylation events ( Suppl. Table S2, see Fig. 1).	"DeltamifR	13	22	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltamifR"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
DeltabfiS biofilms were more similar to 24 - hr - old wild type biofilms than to wild type biofilms at more mature stages.	"DeltabfiS	0	9	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltabfiS"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Based on analyses of biofilm architecture, as well as of protein production and phosphorylation patterns, our findings indicate that DeltabfiS biofilms are arrested in the transition from reversible to the irreversible attachment stage ( 8 hr to 24 - hr - old biofilms, respectively).

Post 144 hr of arabinose removal, the biofilm architecture of the complemented mutants was similar to mutant biofilms lacking the respective regulatory gene ( Figs. 2, 5).	"arabinose	15	24	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""arabinose"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
However, BfiS - like sensory proteins with identities ranging between 28 - 68% were detected in a variety of Gram - negative bacteria, in particular in alpha -, beta -, and gamma - proteobacteria ( Suppl.

Comprised of over 20 proteins, T3SS are complex structures with relation to the flagellar T3SS [ 1], [ 2] and include several central features; ( i) inner and outer membrane ring structures, ( ii) an extracellular needle structure with pore - forming proteins at the distal tip that engage a host cell membrane, ( iii) an ATPase at the base of the apparatus with energetic and chaperone - effector recruitment roles, and ( iv) a suite of chaperones to coordinate the assembly and function of the apparatus during infection.

The predicted srcA gene product was a small protein approximately16 kDa with a pI of 4. 6, similar to secretion chaperones associated with T3SS.	"srcA	14	18	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""srcA"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

After three days of infection the geometric mean competitive index ( CI) for the mutant was 0. 20 ( 95% CI 0. 13 - 0. 29) and 0. 18 ( 95% CI 0. 06 - 0. 5) in the spleen and liver respectively ( P < 0. 0001; Fig. 1D) indicating that bacteria lacking srcA were significantly out competed by wild type cells during systemic infection.

SrcA crystallized in space group C2 with two molecules related by a 2 - fold symmetry axis in each asymmetric unit ( Fig. 2B).	"SrcA	0	4	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SrcA"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The dimer interface formed between SrcA monomers occurs primarily through reciprocal hydrophobic interactions between alpha2 and alpha2 ' with additional interface - stabilizing interactions occurring between the alpha2 helix of one monomer and beta4 and beta5 strands of the opposing monomer ( Fig. 2B).

A comparison of normalized gene expression levels from the two data sets provides insight into the biology of the flea - mammal life cycle.	"flea	114	118	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Several virulence factors were differentially regulated in the two hosts, but others were not ( Table 1).	"hosts	67	72	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""hosts"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

Differential regulation of members of the PhoP regulon may occur depending on the inducing stimulus, however [ 48].	"PhoP	42	46	Regulon"	"[{""token"": ""PhoP"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Regulon""}]"
Induction of a phagocytosis - resistant phenotype in the flea	"flea	57	61	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Bacteria from fleas showed significantly lower levels of phagocytosis ( Fig. 4A).	"fleas	14	19	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""fleas"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We have previously reported analogous findings using human polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( PMNs) [ 7].	"human	53	58	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The yit and yip genes in a Y. pestis locus ( y0181 - 0191) that encode predicted insecticidal - like toxins of the toxin complex ( Tc) family and three linked phage - related genes were upregulated 4 - to 50 - fold in the flea midgut ( Tables 1 and S1).	"flea	222	226	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 222, ""end_span"": 226, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These observations, and the fact that the Yersinia Tc proteins have toxicity to certain eukaryotic cell lines in vitro [ 50], [ 51], prompted us to investigate a possible post - transmission antiphagocytic role for these proteins in the mammalian host.	"host	247	251	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""host"", ""start_span"": 247, ""end_span"": 251, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
To determine if the insecticidal - like toxins were involved in resistance to phagocytosis, we repeated the macrophage experiments with a Y. pestis DeltayitR mutant, which as expected showed greatly reduced expression of the yit and yip genes in vitro and in the flea ( Fig. 4B).	"flea	263	267	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 263, ""end_span"": 267, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Since the yit and yip genes are not required for Y. pestis to produce a transmissible infection in fleas, it was possible to compare the virulence of wild - type and DeltayitR Y. pestis following transmission by fleabite.	"fleas	99	104	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""fleas"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The incidence rate and time to disease onset were identical for both Y. pestis strains, demonstrating that expression of yit and yip is not essential for flea - borne transmission or disease ( data not shown).	"flea	154	158	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, it was not possible to detect any relatively minor difference in LD50 because the number of bacteria transmitted by a blocked flea varies widely [ 1], [ 52].	"flea	135	139	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Even a small decrease in LD50 provided by the Yit - Yip proteins would be significant at the ecological level in the maintenance of plague transmission cycles, because the transmission efficiency of blocked fleas is very low - often only a few or no bacterial cells are transmitted in an individual fleabite [ 52].

Does transit through the flea vector preadapt Y. pestis to resist mammalian innate immunity?	"flea	25	29	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
When Y. pestis is transmitted into the dermis by an infected flea, it is immediately exposed to the mammalian innate immune system.	"flea	61	65	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Our results indicate that Y. pestis entering the mammal from an infective flea is relatively resistant to macrophages, as well as PMNs [ 7]; a vector - specific phenotype that is not related to the T3SS or capsule.	"flea	74	78	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In summary, Y. pestis appears to be prepared for pathogenesis in the mammal while still in the flea vector.	"flea	95	99	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The biofilm phenotype of Y. pestis and the virulence factors upregulated or highly expressed in the flea may enhance the earliest stages of plague pathogenesis while the full complement of temperature - shift - regulated virulence factors is still being induced.

Methodology / Principal Findings A total of 127 differentially expressed genes were found: 83 were over expressed and 44 were less expressed in the bvrR mutant.	"bvrR	148	152	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bvrR"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Finally, the expression of eleven genes which have been previously related with Brucella virulence was also altered.	"Brucella	80	88	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Brucella"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

The ORFeome - based Brucella whole - genome DNA microarray used in this study has been previously validated for the analysis of gene expression under any experimental conditions [ 7].

The statistical analysis resulted in the identification of a total of 127 genes differentially transcribed in the bvrR mutant versus the wild type.	"bvrR	114	118	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bvrR"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Eighty three genes ( 65%) were up - and 44 ( 35%) were down - regulated ( the complete list of differentially expressed genes in the bvrR mutant versus the wild type is show in Table S1).	"bvrR	133	137	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bvrR"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
For genes of annotated function, 59 appeared to be up regulated and 38 down regulated in the bvrR mutant.	"bvrR	93	97	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bvrR"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Total RNA from both Brucella strains were reverse transcribed into cDNA.	"Brucella	20	28	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Brucella"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Data were normalized by the 2 - DeltaDeltaCt method [ 9] using the IF - 1 housekeeping gene of Brucella as reference ( Table 1).	"Brucella	95	103	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Brucella"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Transcriptional data of forty - one ( 85%) of the genes selected gave identical tendency by both methods microarray and RT - PCR: 22 were up and 19 were down regulated in the bvrR mutant.	"bvrR	175	179	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bvrR"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 179, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Next, we will focus on the genes differentially expressed in the bvrR mutant ( a complete representation of the differentially expressed genes is show in Figure 2).	"bvrR	65	69	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bvrR"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In addition, proteomic analysis of Brucella outer membrane fragments demonstrated that the expression of several OMPs, lipoproteins and chaperones was altered in these mutants [ 6].	"Brucella	35	43	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Brucella"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Our microarray results demonstrated several genes directly involved in cell envelope or outer membrane biogenesis differentially expressed in the bvrR mutant.	"bvrR	146	150	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bvrR"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Interestingly, all genes related with carbohydrate, amino or fatty acids metabolism were up - regulated in the bvrR mutant.	"bvrR	111	115	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bvrR"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As show in Figure 3, growth of the bvrR mutant was significantly reduced in minimal media.	"bvrR	35	39	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bvrR"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Other genes differentially expressed in the bvrR mutant included denitrification genes.	"bvrR	44	48	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bvrR"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In fact, some of these denitrification genes have been related with the virulence in mice [ 10], [ 11].	"mice	85	89	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In most of these loci, upstream of the regulatory gene the pckA is divergently expressed ( Figure 2).	"pckA	59	63	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""pckA"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In alpha - proteobacteria, it has been proposed that HPr might control the phosphorylation state of the transcription regulator [ 12] - [ 14].	"HPr	53	56	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""HPr"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This hypothesis could explain the observation that mutants in the regulatory gene bvrR were inhibited in minimal media ( see above).	"bvrR	82	86	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bvrR"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Moreover, it has been demonstrated that VjbR controls the synthesis of exopolysaccharides and the productions of several OMPs, some of which are also involved in virulence [ 22].	"VjbR	40	44	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""VjbR"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Interestingly, our results also showed that the expression of vjbR was also induced intracellularly ( see below).	"vjbR	62	66	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""vjbR"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Other authors [ 29] suggest that ExoR is an inhibitor of two - component signaling that may be conserved in a large number of alpha - proteobacteria.	"ExoR	33	37	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ExoR"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Based on all these findings, obvious comparison about the function of all these regulators in Brucella could be made.	"Brucella	94	102	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Brucella"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Our microarray results demonstrated that at least 127 genes were differentially expressed in the bvrR mutant.	"bvrR	97	101	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bvrR"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, 30 of the genes differentially expressed in the bvrR mutant compared with the parental strain have a yet uncharacterized function.	"bvrR	57	61	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bvrR"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Replacement of Cys102 with Ser or His272 with Ala abolishes the enzymatic activity of SeMac, and the Asp294Ala mutation greatly decreases the enzymatic activity.	"SeMac	86	91	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SeMac"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, S. equi effectively evades the horse innate immunity by being resistant to phagocytosis by PMNs.	"horse	40	45	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""horse"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

The immunity is primarily mediated by protective antibodies [ 4], which opsonize and thus enhance phagocytosis of S. equi by horse PMNs.	"horse	125	130	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""horse"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
