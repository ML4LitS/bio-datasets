Together, our findings correlate perfectly with the in vivo data described above and suggest that the lack of ESAT - 6 specific T cell recognition for H37Ra, H37Ra:: fadE5, H37Ra:: rpsL, and SO2 is not caused by a loss of ESAT - 6 expression, but rather due to a failure of ( phoP dependent) ESAT - 6 secretion.

Altogether, from these reports it seems plausible that the pleiotropic regulator PhoP is involved in the regulation of rv3612c - rv3616c expression and thereby influences ESAT - 6 secretion and virulence [ 16], but to unambiguously answer this question, virulence tests with recombinant H37Ra and / or phoP ko strains that express rv3616c - 3612c under a constitutive promoter or a tetracycline inducable expression system [ 39] will be needed.
