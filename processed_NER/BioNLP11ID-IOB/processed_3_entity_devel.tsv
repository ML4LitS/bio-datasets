Acid pH activation of the PmrA / PmrB two - component regulatory system of Salmonella enterica	"PmrA	26	30	Protein"	"PmrB	33	37	Protein"	"Salmonella enterica	75	94	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Salmonella enterica"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Our results suggest that protonation of the PmrB periplasmic histidine and / or of the glutamic acid residues activate the PmrA protein, and that mild acid promotes cellular changes resulting in polymyxin B resistance.

PmrD binds to the phosphorylated form of PmrA protecting it from dephosphorylation by PmrB ( Kato and Groisman, 2004).

Here we show that PmrA ' s cognate sensor kinase PmrB is required for responding to external changes in pH through a mechanism that requires a histidine and several glutamic acid residues located in its periplasmic domain, as well as the post - translational activator PmrD protein.	"PmrA	18	22	Protein"	"PmrB	49	53	Protein"	"PmrD	269	273	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PmrD"", ""start_span"": 269, ""end_span"": 273, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
A similar induction of pbgP transcription was found when MES was used as the buffering agent in the media at pH 5. 8 instead of Bis - Tris ( data not shown), indicating that the mild acid effect on gene expression was not due to a particular buffering system.

Moreover, a mutant expressing a derivative of the PmrA protein that cannot be phosphorylated due to substitution of the putative phosphorylation residue aspartate 51 by alanine ( Kato and Groisman, 2004) completely failed to promote transcription of PmrA - activated genes in response to pH 5. 8, in a similar fashion to the pmrA strain ( A. Kato and E. A. Groisman, unpubl. results).	"PmrA	50	54	Protein"	"PmrA	250	254	Protein"	"pmrA	325	329	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 250, ""end_span"": 254, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pmrA"", ""start_span"": 325, ""end_span"": 329, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We considered the possibility of PmrA being phosphorylated from acetyl phosphate because acetyl phosphate has been shown to serve as phosphoryl donor to several response regulators when their cognate sensors are absent ( see Wolfe, 2005 for a review).	"PmrA	33	37	Protein"	"acetyl phosphate	64	80	Chemical"	"acetyl phosphate	89	105	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""acetyl phosphate"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""acetyl phosphate"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
The PhoP - activated PmrD protein favours the phosphorylated state of the PmrA protein ( Fig. 1) ( Kato and Groisman, 2004).

These results imply that the pmrD gene was being expressed even though the media contained 10 mM MgCl2, a concentration known to repress transcription of PhoP - activated genes ( Soncini et al., 1996).

In agreement with the gene transcription data, Western blot analysis of crude extracts using anti - PmrD antibodies showed that the PmrD protein was produced in cells grown in N - minimal medium pH 5. 8 and 10 mM MgCl2 but not in cells grown in the same medium buffered at pH 7. 7 ( Fig. 4B).

There was no pbgP expression in cells grown at pH 5. 8 ( Fig. 5B) or in the presence of Fe3 + ( Fig. 5D), which is in contrast to the normal activation in response to low Mg2 + ( Fig. 5C).	"pbgP	13	17	Protein"	"Fe3 +	88	93	Chemical"	"Mg2 +	171	176	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""pbgP"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Fe3 +"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""Mg2 +"", ""start_span"": 171, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Together, these results argue in favour of the notion that PmrB senses extracellular pH besides its previously described ligands Fe3 + and Al3 + ( Wosten et al., 2000).	"PmrB	59	63	Protein"	"Fe3 +	129	134	Chemical"	"Al3 +	139	144	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Fe3 +"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""Al3 +"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Because the PmrA / PmrB system is required for resistance to the antimicrobial peptide polymyxin B ( Roland et al., 1993), we hypothesized that mild acid pH could induce this resistance.	"PmrA	12	16	Protein"	"PmrB	19	23	Protein"	"polymyxin B	87	98	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""polymyxin B"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
This resistance was PmrA - dependent because a strain deficient in the pmrA gene was approximately 100 000 - fold more sensitive to polymyxin B than the wild - type strain when grown pH 5. 8 ( Fig. 7).	"PmrA	20	24	Protein"	"pmrA	71	75	Protein"	"polymyxin B	132	143	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pmrA"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""polymyxin B"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Likewise, the human receptor OGR1 responds to both pH and sphingosylphosphorylcholine ( Ludwig et al., 2003).

Mlc regulation of Salmonella pathogenicity island I gene expression via hilE repression	"Mlc	0	3	Protein"	"Salmonella	18	28	Organism"	"hilE	72	76	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mlc"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""hilE"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We found that the two known promoters of hilE were not modulated by Mlc, and we identified a third promoter, designated P3, which was repressed by Mlc.	"hilE	41	45	Protein"	"Mlc	68	71	Protein"	"Mlc	147	150	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""hilE"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Mlc"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Mlc"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The gel mobility shift assay and footprinting analysis revealed that Mlc repressed hilE in a direct manner by binding to two distinct sites in the hilE P3 promoter region.	"Mlc	69	72	Protein"	"hilE	83	87	Protein"	"hilE	147	151	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mlc"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilE"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilE"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Based on these results, we propose that Mlc functions to sense the availability of sugars and is linked to virulence gene regulation by its ability to control hilE expression in Salmonella.	"Mlc	40	43	Protein"	"hilE	159	163	Protein"	"Salmonella	178	188	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Mlc"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilE"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 163, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 178, ""end_span"": 188, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Recently, Baxter and Jones ( 18) have shown that HilE is an important Salmonella - specific regulator of hilA expression.

We examined the ability of an mlc mutant, SR1304, to invade cultured HEp - 2 and HeLa epithelial cells.

When the Salmonella bacteria were grown in static cultures to the exponential phase ( SPI1 - inducing condition), the invasiveness of SR1304 for both epithelial cell lines was reduced by about 3 - fold, compared to that of SL1344 ( Figure 1A and B).	"Salmonella	9	19	Organism"	"SR1304	134	140	Organism"	"SL1344	223	229	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""SR1304"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""SL1344"", ""start_span"": 223, ""end_span"": 229, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Figure 1C shows that SL1344 killed 42% of the macrophages, whereas SR1304 killed only 16% of the macrophages 4h after infection, which demonstrates that the mlc gene plays an important role in the expression of genes involved in cytotoxicity.

Collectively, these results suggest that the main target of Mlc action in Salmonella virulence is SPI1, which is known to encode various genes that are required for Salmonella invasion of host cells.

The hilE mRNA level measured by real - time PCR also revealed that hilE expression was increased in SR1304 by about 2 - fold ( Figure 3A).

Using a primer extension assay with the hilE5 primer ( Table 2), the promoter of hilE, which is designated as P3, was newly identified; this promoter initiates 335 nucleotides upstream of the translation start site of hilE ( Figure 4B, lane 1).

A gel mobility shift assay was performed with purified Mlc, to test whether Mlc directly represses the hilE P3 promoter.

Sequestration of Mlc by the unphosphorylated form of glucose permease, enzyme IICBGlc, is known to displace Mlc from its DNA - binding sites, thereby allowing transcription of its target genes ( 25 - 27).

In the absence of sugars, the mlc mutation increased hilE expression 1. 5 - fold, with a concomitant reduction in hilD expression.

The genetic evidence to date is consistent with a regulatory cascade of transcriptional activation, in which HilD, HilA and InvF act sequentially to activate SPI1 expression.

In brief, HilD binds directly to sites upstream of hilA and invFD and acts as an activator ( 14, 16, 36).

HilA activates the transcription of invFA and SPI1 - T3SS apparatus genes required for the secretion of effector proteins, whereas the expression of effector proteins is regulated by InvF ( 10, 11).

This may be partly due to the expression of hilC, a de - repressor of hilA, which was not reduced in the mlc mutant ( Figure 2A).

We have reported previously that there may be an independent hilC regulatory pathway that is not applicable to hilA or invFA regulation when bacteria respond to changes in osmolarity ( 29).

Our data clearly demonstrate that Mlc directly regulates hilE expression by binding to the hilE P3 promoter ( Figure 5).

It has been demonstrated that the region 190 - 270 - bp upstream of the hilE promoter is required for the activation of hilE P2 expression by FimYZ, which is a response regulator that is involved in the expression of type 1 fimbriae and motility genes ( 18, Figure 5C).

In addition, hilE expression was also increased in the presence of arabinose, which suggests an additional regulatory mechanism mediated by arabinose.

The experiments of functional complementation with the complemented strain CDeltasalKR showed clearly that the reintroduction of salKR into DeltasalKR restored its high pathogenicity.

Since the first description of human infection in Denmark in 1968, SS2 seems to have developed some unknown machinery to behave much more invasively, which is supported by two recent large - scale outbreaks of human epidemics in China ( one had 25 cases with 14 deaths in Jiangsu in 1998, the second had 204 cases with 38 deaths in Sichuan in 2005) [ 4], [ 5].

These results indicate definitely that SalK / SalR plays a critical role in the pathogenicity of SS2.

In the 89K island, transcripts of only two genes designated 05SSU0935 and 05SSU0953 that encode a hypothetical protein and a DNA recombinase respectively, were decreased in DeltasalKR, their contributions to the attenuation are unknown.

It seems that SalK / SalR may control the full virulence of SS2 by regulating distant gene expression at the genome - wide level.

Secondly, some of the TCSTSs of S. pneumoniae were suggested to be involved in key processes of pathogenesis, such as autolysis and cell - cell signaling [ 52], SalK / SalR might regulate similar processes in Chinese SS2 virulent isolates.

In conclusion, a unique two - component regulatory system SalK / SalR has been identified from a putative 89K PAI in Chinese isolates of highly pathogenic SS2.

Our data confirm, for the first time, that SalK / SalR is absolutely indispensable for the full virulence of Chinese highly invasive SS2 strains, although we fails to define its precise regulatory mechanism.

Mutants lacking the gene encoding the alternative sigma factor sigmaE ( rpoE) are also highly attenuated for intracellular survival, pointing to a potential connection with the SsrAB regulatory system.

Results In this study we demonstrate that RpoE is involved in fine - tuning the expression of a subset of SsrB - regulated genes found in the Salmonella pathogenicity island - 2 ( SPI - 2) genetic locus that encodes a horizontally acquired type III secretion system, and unlinked genes integrated into this regulon that are required for virulence in host animals.

SPI - 2 also has genes, ssrA and ssrB, which code for SsrAB, a two - component regulatory system needed for expression of the T3SS [ 6, 7].

By testing six promoters representing four classes of SsrB - regulated promoters ( ( i) two type III secretion structural operons in SPI - 2, ( ii) the effector operon in SPI - 2, ( iii) two effector genes unlinked with SPI - 2, and ( iv) an integrated virulence gene unlinked with SPI - 2) we demonstrate that RpoE elicits an effect on a subset of SsrB - regulated genes.

This effect was bidirectional depending on the promoter and was downstream of ssrB expression itself, since deletion of rpoE had no effect on SsrB levels in the mutant cells.

Deletion of rpoE affects a subset of SsrB - regulated virulence genes Salmonella virulence gene expression is coordinated in vivo and may be regulated, in part, by alternative sigma factor ( s) in order to quickly respond to the host environment.

In this screen, rpoS deletion resulted in a slight increase in SseB levels ( Figure 1A) indicating a role for RpoS in the repression of SPI - 2.

Since we were predominantly interested in sigma factors that activate SPI - 2 and which could be linked to the previous observation that rpoE mutants are highly attenuated in vivo we choose to focus on RpoE in the current study, which had the most influence on SseB levels in the cell.

To do this we examined the levels of SseL - 2HA, SifA - 2HA and SrfN - 2HA expressed from their endogenous promoters under SPI - 2 inducing conditions ( Figure 1C).

In this work we found that the alternative sigma factor, sigmaE, is involved in fine tuning the expressing of a subset of SsrB - regulated virulence genes required for Salmonella pathogenesis.

It has been reported previously in Salmonella typhimurium that a loss of proper chemotaxis control through a cheB mutation, leads to a ' tumbly ' swimming phenotype and a strong reduction in the isolates ability to invade human epithelial HEP2 cells as well as a reduction in infectivity in a mouse ligated - loop model [ 31].

In P. fluorescens ColS has been implicated in root colonization while in Pseudomonas putida it has been reported to be involved in regulating TN4652 transposition and heavy metal resistance [ 37], [ 38], [ 39], [ 40].

Another mutant had an insertion in PA2585 encoding the UvrABC endonuclease subunit UvrC, required for the excision of damaged DNA.

To validate that the loss of virulence and other phenotypic changes observed with the TB strain were a result of the transposon disruption of the cheB2 gene, we generated a new mutant by interrupting the cheB2 gene ( see Materials and Methods).

As shown in Figure 3A, the newly engineered cheB2 mutant, called TB0173i ( p < 0. 005), showed a delayed C. elegans killing comparable to the original STM cheB2 mutant TB0173s ( p < 0. 004).

This construct was introduced into the cheB2 mutant, TB0173s, generating the TB0173sp2B2 strain.

The cheB1 mutation was engineered in the TB strain as described in materials and methods, yielding TB1459i.

The cheB1 mutant was used to feed C. elegans in the slow killing assay and the survival percentage was compared to those obtained when using the cheB2 mutant or the parental TB strain ( Figure 3C).

This is in contrast to the loss of virulence in the original cheB2 mutant ( TB0173s) and the insertional cheB2 mutant TB0173i.

Surviving mice infected with the cheB2 mutant showed a significantly less troubled body condition from days 3 to 6 post infection ( P < 0. 01, Mann - Whitney rank test) than surviving mice infected with the wild type strain indicating that the former group recovered earlier than the latter ( Figure 4B).

To further evaluate the change in virulence between the parental TB isolate and the TB0173s cheB2 mutant, mice were sacrificed 2 days after bacterial challenge and the lungs were formalin fixed and paraffin embedded.

Lungs from infected mice challenged with the TB strain as well as the complemented TB0173sp2B2 strain had a pronounced polymorphonuclear neutrophil ( PMN) infiltration as well as strong peribronchiolar and perivascular inflammation ( Figure 5A).

This mutant, named TB0173s, has a transposon insertion in PA0173, cheB2, one of four cheB genes found in P. aeruginosa.

Most importantly in a mouse lung model of infection, the cheB2 mutant was highly attenuated and failed to induce strong inflammatory response in the infected mice lungs.

It has been shown that a cheW mutant in Helicobacter pylori is unable to establish a normal long - term infection in mice, remaining only in one portion of the stomach.
