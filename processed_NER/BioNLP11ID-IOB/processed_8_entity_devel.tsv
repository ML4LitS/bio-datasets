The low Mg2 + activation of the PmrA protein requires PhoQ, a protein that senses extracellular Mg2 + levels ( Vescovi et al., 1996), PhoQ ' s cognate regulator PhoP, and the PhoP - activated protein PmrD ( Kox et al., 2000; Kato and Groisman, 2004).

Mild acid pH induces transcription of PmrA - regulated genes To examine the mild acid pH induction of PmrA - activated genes, we grew Salmonella cells harbouring chromosomal lacZYA transcriptional fusions to the PmrA - regulated genes pbgP, pmrC and ugd ( Wosten and Groisman, 1999) in N - minimal media buffered at pH 5. 8 or 7. 7.

That PmrB is likely to sense changes in pH directly is supported by three findings: ( i) the mild acid pH - dependent activation of the PmrA - regulated gene pbgP was dramatically reduced in a strain lacking pmrB ( Fig. 3), ( ii) the periplasmic domain of PmrB was necessary for activation of pbgP under mild acid conditions ( Fig. 5), and ( iii) single amino acid substitutions in conserved histidine and glutamic acid residues located in the periplasmic domain of PmrB abolished its ability to stimulate pbgP transcription at pH 5. 8 ( Fig. 6).

However, the effects of Mlc on hilD expression and bacterial invasiveness were not seen in the hilE mutant, and hilE expression was increased in the mlc mutant, which suggests that Mlc exerts positive effects on the expression of SPI1 genes by reducing the expression of HilE, which is known to down - regulate the expression of SPI1 genes through direct interaction with HilD.

In the animal model, attenuation of virulence has been noted for Salmonella strains that carry mutations in the pts, crr, cya or crp genes, which encode the general energy - coupling enzymes of the PTS, enzyme IIAGlc of the PTS, adenylate cyclase and cyclic AMP receptor protein, respectively ( 23, 24).
