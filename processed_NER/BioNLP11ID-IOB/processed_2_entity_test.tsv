Several genetic studies have demonstrated the regulation of AMP synthesis by the Toll and immune - deficient ( Imd) pathways.

More recently, we isolated Pseudomonas entomophila, a Gram - negative natural bacterial pathogen of Drosophila, from flies in Guadeloupe [ 9].	"Pseudomonas entomophila	27	50	Organism"	"Drosophila	100	110	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Pseudomonas entomophila"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Importantly, in contrast to Ecc15, P. entomophila is highly pathogenic for Drosophila as well as for species from a different insect order ( Lepidoptera).	"Ecc15	28	33	Organism"	"Drosophila	75	85	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Ecc15"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We present in vivo evidence for a direct role in pathogenesis of the secreted P. entomophila zinc metalloprotease, AprA, which counteracts AMPs synthesized by the host.	"zinc	93	97	Chemical"	"AprA	115	119	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""zinc"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
No killing of either larvae or adults was observed with a culture filtrate derived from the avirulent P. entomophila strain carrying a Tn5 transposon in the gacA gene [ 9].	"Tn5	135	138	Protein"	"gacA	157	161	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Tn5"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These data suggested that P. entomophila secreted one or more factors with toxic activity under the control of the GacS / GacA two - component system.	"GacS	115	119	Protein"	"GacA	122	126	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GacS"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GacA"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Interestingly, in a gacA mutant the number of proteins in the supernatant was greatly reduced, including the complete absence of the 51 - kDa band corresponding to AprA ( Figure 1C, lane 3).	"gacA	20	24	Protein"	"AprA	164	168	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 168, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Two independent Tn5 insertions in the prtR gene affecting virulence have recently been identified in a random insertional mutagenesis screen of P. entomophila [ 10].	"Tn5	16	19	Protein"	"prtR	38	42	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Tn5"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""prtR"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore, the prtR supernatant showed no toxicity toward flies after injection, suggesting a correlation between AprA levels and virulence ( unpublished data).	"prtR	17	21	Protein"	"AprA	116	120	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""prtR"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Altogether, this analysis indicates that P. entomophila gacA and prtR genes regulate the secretion of a protease with toxic activity when injected into flies or fed to larvae.	"gacA	56	60	Protein"	"prtR	65	69	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""prtR"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We inactivated the aprA gene by inserting a tetracycline resistance cassette by a double homologous recombination event.

To analyze the in vivo contribution of AprA to P. entomophila virulence, we performed a survival analysis of Drosophila larvae and adults after oral infection with various P. entomophila derivatives.	"AprA	39	43	Protein"	"Drosophila	109	119	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Only 40% of the aprA - infected larvae succumbed within 3 days, while 70% of the larvae died after infection with wild - type P. entomophila, demonstrating that the aprA mutant was attenuated for virulence ( Figure 2B).	"aprA	16	20	Protein"	"aprA	165	169	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 169, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, aprA gut persistence remained higher than that of gacA mutants.	"aprA	9	13	Protein"	"gacA	59	63	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Complementation of the aprA mutant with the wild - type apr operon restored protease secretion and activity ( Figure 1C, lane 7, and 1F) and resulted in a complete regain of function with respect to all virulence phenotypes ( Figures 2B and S1).	"aprA	23	27	Protein"	"apr	56	59	Regulon"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""apr"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Regulon""}]"
In contrast, no rescue was observed with a plasmid containing the full apr operon but carrying a non - polar mutation in aprA ( Figures 2B and S1).	"apr	71	74	Regulon"	"aprA	121	125	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""apr"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Regulon""}, {""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The observation that both factors are under the control of the GacS / GacA, confirmed that this two - component system is the master regulator of P. entomophila virulence.	"GacS	63	67	Protein"	"GacA	70	74	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GacS"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GacA"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
AprA Confers Protection against the Imd - Dependent Immune Response	"AprA	0	4	Protein"	"Imd	36	39	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To determine at which time Imd was required to impede P. entomophila infection, we monitored survival to P. entomophila in flies in which the Imd pathway was artificially activated in a time - dependent manner.	"Imd	27	30	Protein"	"Imd	142	145	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Altogether, these data reveal that the Imd pathway is crucial for host survival after oral infection with P. entomophila and that AprA plays a key role in counteracting this effect.	"Imd	39	42	Protein"	"AprA	130	134	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We thus compared resistance to P. entomophila infection of flies that were previously either orally infected with Ecc15 ( to activate a local immune response) or pricked with Ecc15 ( to activate a systemic immune response).	"Ecc15	114	119	Organism"	"Ecc15	175	180	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Ecc15"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Ecc15"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 180, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Figure 5C shows that a prior infection with Ecc15 protected flies against a subsequent P. entomophila infection only when Ecc15 was administrated orally, indicating that the local, but not the systemic immune response, plays an important role in P. entomophila clearance.	"Ecc15	44	49	Organism"	"Ecc15	122	127	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Ecc15"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Ecc15"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This experiment shows that wild - type, but not Rel flies previously infected with Ecc15 evf -, resisted a second challenge by P. entomophila ( Figure 5D).	"Rel	48	51	Protein"	"evf	89	92	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rel"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""evf"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The results described above were corroborated by the over - expression of Imd in the gut or in the fat body using specific Gal4 drivers.	"Imd	74	77	Protein"	"Gal4	123	127	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Gal4"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These flies lack a functional Imd pathway except in the gut where cad - Gal4 is expressed.

AprA Confers Protection against Diptericin	"AprA	0	4	Protein"	"Diptericin	32	42	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Diptericin"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We have shown that AprA protects P. entomophila against the Imd - regulated immune response.

Previous studies indicated that Attacin A and Diptericin are the AMP genes most strongly induced in the gut following ingestion of infectious bacteria [ 7].	"Attacin A	32	41	Protein"	"Diptericin	46	56	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Attacin A"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Diptericin"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We confirmed that P. entomophila AprA rapidly degrades Cecropin A in vitro ( unpublished data).	"AprA	33	37	Protein"	"Cecropin A	55	65	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Cecropin A"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In a first set of experiments, we compared the survival rate of wild - type, imd, and imd; da > Dpt or AttA flies to natural infection with P. entomophila.	"Dpt	96	99	Protein"	"AttA	103	107	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Dpt"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""AttA"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To investigate the in vivo relationship between AMP activity and microbial persistence we next compared the numbers of bacteria of wild - type P. entomophila and aprA mutants in imd fly lines over - expressing Diptericin.	"aprA	162	166	Protein"	"Diptericin	210	220	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 162, ""end_span"": 166, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Diptericin"", ""start_span"": 210, ""end_span"": 220, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Figure 6B shows that the aprA mutant persisted less well than wild - type bacteria in imd flies over - expressing Diptericin.	"aprA	25	29	Protein"	"Diptericin	114	124	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Diptericin"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This result clearly indicates an in vivo action of AprA against Diptericin.

Altogether, our results provide an in vivo demonstration that AprA functions in the protection of P. entomophila against Drosophila AMPs.	"AprA	62	66	Protein"	"Drosophila	121	131	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Local Expression of AMP Genes Plays a Major Role against Food - Borne Infections The use of GFP reporter transgenes in Drosophila has revealed that, in addition to the fat body, AMP genes can be expressed in several barrier epithelia that are in direct contact with microorganisms from the environment [ 7, 23].	"GFP	92	95	Protein"	"Drosophila	119	129	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""GFP"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Our study reveals that over - expression of either Diptericin or Attacin confers protection against P. entomophila.	"Diptericin	51	61	Protein"	"Attacin	65	72	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Diptericin"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Attacin"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It is also possible that Diptericin could reach high concentration levels in restricted areas of the Drosophila gut such as the proventriculus and thus be more effective against pathogens than in other body compartments.	"Diptericin	25	35	Protein"	"Drosophila	101	111	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Diptericin"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Our study suggests that Diptericin expression in the anterior gut provides an efficient early barrier allowing Drosophila to rapidly eliminate most ingested bacteria.

In bacteria, nitrogen and carbon sources are frequently provided by enzymatic degradation of extracellular biopolymers by proteases and glycosidases.

Proteases, especially metalloproteases, are also known to contribute to virulence in some pathogenic bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. marcescens, and Bacillus thuringiensis [ 20, 21, 26].

In B. thuringiensis, it has been proposed that the protease InhA2 participates in the degradation of the gut, thus facilitating the action of the Cry toxins [ 27, 28].	"InhA2	60	65	Protein"	"Cry	146	149	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""InhA2"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Cry"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, oral ingestion of purified AprA induces only low levels of lethality, indicating that AprA alone is not sufficient to kill the host via this route of entry, and other factors participate in oral toxicity.	"AprA	36	40	Protein"	"AprA	95	99	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The GacS / GacA two - component regulatory system is conserved in numerous Gram - negative bacteria and has been shown to regulate a wide variety of cellular functions and virulence factors [ 30, 31].

This indicates that AprA is not the sole virulence factor required for persistence in the Drosophila gastrointestinal tract.	"AprA	20	24	Protein"	"Drosophila	90	100	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Our results indicate that the GacS / GacA two - component system regulates one or several genes that promote bacterial survival in the gut.

This hypothesized persistence - promoting factor may have a function similar to the Erwinia virulence factor ( evf) gene of E. carotovora Ecc15 that promotes persistence of Gram - negative bacteria in the larval gut [ 34].

Finally, our study shows that aprA, but not gacA, mutants of P. entomophila retain a moderate capacity to kill both adult flies and larvae.

Further characterization of these novel genes revealed that they impair motility through diverse mechanisms such as disrupting signaling through phosphorelay cascades, altering concentrations of the recently appreciated cyclic di - GMP ( c - di - GMP) second messenger, and by mechanisms that have yet to be revealed.	"cyclic di - GMP	220	235	Chemical"	"c - di - GMP	238	250	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""cyclic di - GMP"", ""start_span"": 220, ""end_span"": 235, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""c - di - GMP"", ""start_span"": 238, ""end_span"": 250, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
We confirmed this expectation by showing that deletions of fliT and aer did not affect motility ( data not shown).

The neutral behavior of the fliT mutation is not surprising since fliT null strains were found to make functional flagella in S. enterica [ 19].	"fliT	28	32	Protein"	"fliT	66	70	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""fliT"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fliT"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The protein encoded by aer mediates oxygen and redox sensing, and as such shares overlapping function with the Tsr receptor [ 22].

Because of this redundancy, only aer tsr double mutants are expected to show a motility phenotype in tryptone plates.

The only exception among the che genes is cheZ, whose z - score of + 8. 7 indicates a CW flagellar rotation bias and reduced susceptibility to chi - phage infection.

CheZ is a phosphatase of CheY, the protein whose phosphorylated state biases the flagella toward the CW direction [ 26, 27].

Interrogation of genes with high z - scores in the enrichment for mutants incapable of swarming identified two additional genes that impact surface motility: hns, encoding a global transcriptional regulator, and yfiR, encoding a predicted periplasmic protein of unknown function.

In - frame deletions of these genes abolished swarming; however, while the Deltahns mutant showed a severe swimming defect, the swimming motility of the DeltayfiR mutant was only mildly impaired ( Figures 3D and 4).

OPG mutants were defective in both swimming and swarming; surprisingly, however, only mutants with large LPS truncations showed significant defects in these behaviors ( Figures 3E and 4).

Phosphorylated RcsB is known to bind upstream of the flhDC operon and to repress its expression.

This conclusion is further supported by the dramatic reduction in swimming motility by rcsC137 mutants ( Figure S7), in which the rcsC137 gene product has lost its phosphatase activity [ 40].

The chi - phage selection results suggest that LPS and OPG are necessary for infection.

To evaluate the necessity of LPS and OPG for phage infection, we needed mutants that were defective in these structures but still synthesized functional flagella and were motile.

Therefore, we created double mutants combining an LPS or OPG mutation and a secondary mutation in one of the components of the Rcs signaling pathway.

To test whether such a direct role exists, we interrogated our collection of LPS and OPG mutants for swarming proficiency.

These measurements revealed that indeed the flagella of DeltayhjH mutants, while not strictly locked in one direction of rotation, exhibit a strong CCW bias with a rotational switching frequency intermediate between that found in wild - type cells and in DeltacheR mutants ( Figure 6B).

Secondary insertional mutations were observed to suppress motility defects in Deltahns and DeltayhjH genetic backgrounds ( Figures 6C and S8A).

Among the 18 suppressor mutants sampled at random from the DeltayhjH background, half had insertions in different regions of ycgR, a gene encoding a protein of unknown function ( Figure 6D).

This finding is consistent with a recent report in which the inactivation of ycgR was observed to improve motility of yhjH mutants [ 48].

The cyclase and phosphodiesterase activities have been attributed to GGDEF and EAL protein domains, respectively [ 50, 51], and the activity of these domains is known to have opposite effects on motility [ 52].

The ace gene, like the ebp locus, is ubiquitous in E. faecalis and it occurs in at least four different forms that vary in the number of repeats of the B domain [ 20].

Ace mediates conditional ( that is, after growth at 46degreesC or in the presence of serum or collagen) adherence of E. faecalis to collagen type IV and to laminin [ 21] and, in unpublished data, influences the ability of OG1RF to cause experimental endocarditis ( KV Singh and BE Murray, unpublished observation).

Using the published DNA sequence of V583 as reference ( NC _ 004668), OG1RF shares 2, 474 ORFs as well as the 12 rRNA genes and 58 of 68 tRNA genes ( Table 1).	"V583	36	40	Organism"	"OG1RF	70	75	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""V583"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""OG1RF"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The 10 missing tRNA are localized in a region in V583 that has been replaced in OG1RF by a 49 kb region ( see below).	"V583	49	53	Organism"	"OG1RF	80	85	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""V583"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""OG1RF"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Some of the major insertions / deletions in the two genomes are shown in Figure 2, such as the absence of the pathogenicity island ( PAI) in OG1RF and the presence of an approximately 49 kb fragment unique to OG1RF.

In a more recent analysis of relationships between various E. faecalis strains, the 23. 9 kb region was not detected in 86% of the strains of the clonal complex ( CC) 2, 58% of the CC9 strains, nor in any of the CC8 strains [ 31].

The Symbioflor 1 strain, used as a probiotic, is one representative of the 7. 4% of E. faecalis isolates that are missing the gelE gene in addition to the 23. 9 kb region [ 5, 30].

In OG1RF, this 14. 8 kb region contains two loci, a WxL locus ( described below) and a seven - gene locus that may encode a possible ABC transporter with similarity to one annotated in Pediococcus pentosaceus.

It is interesting to note that while several of these WxL loci, including the EF0750 and EF3184 loci, were present by hybridization in all the strains ( clinical or food isolates) tested by Lepage et al.	"EF0750	78	84	Protein"	"EF3184	89	95	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""EF0750"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""EF3184"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
[ 36], other loci, including the EF3153 and EF3248 loci, were not detected in the majority of these strains.

In addition, it appears that the EF3248 locus diverges in the Symbioflor 1 strain.

Thus, while V583 and OG1RF share much similarity between their surface components, there are unique differences that could potentially be important in affecting the behavior of the strains and might be useful for strain typing.

Consequently, it seems unlikely that this operon is a remnant of a vancomycin resistance operon in OG1RF, but rather part of a still unknown regulatory pathway.

However this most likely is an underestimate of the true number of proteins that are regulated by Hfq, if accurate protein identifications could be made for the remaining 2829 orfs of the entire Salmonella proteome ( 4450 orfs) that are either expressed at levels too low to be detected or not expressed under the four growth conditions employed in this study.

Western blot analysis of PduA and PduE relative protein levels validated results from the proteomics analysis ( Figures 4B, 4C and 4E, 4F).

The strong regulation of Pdu protein expression by Hfq suggests the pdu operon to be a potential target of sRNA regulation and that correct coordinate expression may be essential for activity.

SmpB is thought to be limited to trans - translation but has been shown to increase the translation of a single protein - the stationary phase sigma factor RpoS [ 19].

However, results from our global proteomics analysis indicate that SmpB directly or indirectly modulates the expression of at least 4% of the entire Salmonella Typhimurium proteome determined from ANOVA analysis ( p < 0. 05) ( Table S1).

The majority of genes encoding these proteins showed no changes in mRNA level thus it is interesting to speculate an additional role for SmpB as a general post - transcriptional / translational regulator in Salmonella Typhimurium.

We were interested in determining whether there was overlap in translational regulation between Hfq and SmpB i. e., the extent of cross - talk or level of co - ordination if any between these two translational regulators ( Table S1).

For logarithmic phase growth conditions, the expression pattern of 242 proteins appeared to exhibit a dependence on Hfq, while 37 proteins exhibited a dependency on SmpB.

Under growth in AMM - 1 267 proteins appeared regulated by Hfq and the expression pattern of 86 proteins exhibited a dependence on SmpB.

Using a sample - matched procedure our strategy simultaneously measures changes in global transcript and protein abundance levels allowing for a clear distinction between the transcriptional and post - transcriptional effects of Hfq or SmpB.

Furthermore, our strategy requires no tagging and or isolation of Hfq or SmpB precluding the possibility of spurious results introduced by tagging and or co - immunoprecipitation processes.

The result of this work was very surprising namely that Hfq bound to 20% of all Salmonella mRNA transcripts and at least 64 small RNA molecules.

One possible criticism of this work is that the RNA co - immunoprecipitated with Hfq may be brought down simply because Hfq strongly binds to RNA molecules and that the binding is somewhat non - specific.

These results suggest that while feedback mechanisms between protein abundance and transcript levels exist, the majority of the effects observed here for both hfq and smpB are a result of direct modulation of post - transcriptional events.

P. luminescens produces a signaling molecule AI - 2 to resist reactive oxygen species [ 8] and phenylpropanoid chemical ST to inhibit the activity of antimicrobial enzyme PO and formation of melanotic nodules [ 9], but the strategy used by X. nematophila appears to be that of suppression of transcripts involved in the insect immune response [ 10 - 12].

As a well - defined virulence factor playing a major role in the development of septicemia [ 22], lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis gene lpsE was induced in X. koppenhoeferi, but not in P. temperata, which may explain in part why relatively slower growing X. koppenhoeferi did not differ from P. temperata in virulence to R. majalis in our previous studies [ 17].

Further, as Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus bacteria can switch their phenotypes upon insect infection, we speculate that upregulation of transposase genes in both bacteria may contribute to genetic variability for better adaptation and survival in a particular niche [ 50].

It is generally accepted that SPI - 2 was acquired by Salmonella enterica after divergence from S. bongori, providing a useful pedigree to study regulatory evolution influenced by SsrB.

Combining our data with previous biochemical work, along with comparative genomic analyses with an orthologous T3SS - encoding genomic island in the tsetse fly endosymbiont, Sodalis glossinidius, we reveal the flexible DNA palindrome that distributes SsrB in the genome to influence transcriptional activation of the SPI - 2 T3SS and almost all of its accessory effector proteins.

To examine SsrB allocation on the chromosome in vivo, we isolated functional SsrB - DNA interactions using chromatin immunoprecipitation and examined the bound DNA by chip analysis ( ChIP - on - chip) using an S.

To solve this problem in the context of mapping the SsrB binding element, we used comparative genomics to search for conserved promoter architecture in another organism with a similar genomic island to Salmonella SPI - 2.

However, other lines of evidence suggested that the recognition site architecture was flexible in nature: ( i) our bacterial one - hybrid screen isolated functional single hexamer sequences, ( ii) the SsrB footprint at the naturally evolved sseA promoter within SPI - 2 [ 26] contained only one reasonably well - conserved heptamer, and ( iii) degenerate or non - ideal palindromes exist in the genome.

The transcriptional activity from a wild - type Sodalis palindrome sequence was high, but was completely abolished in an ssrB mutant and in experiments where only the palindrome sequence was precisely deleted ( Figure 5D).

In wild - type cells these reporters were as active as other SPI - 2 promoters, whereas promoter activity was abrogated in DeltassrB cells, implicating this IGR as a functional promoter for ssaR ( Figure 6B and Figure S4).

The ChIP - on - chip data not only provided information on the identities of SsrB - regulated genes but also gave insight as to the identity of the SsrB recognition element specified by the interaction site sequences.

Thus, in addition to supporting a pathogenic lifestyle within a host in Salmonella, it seems probable that this common promoter architecture may direct the activation of the SSR - 3 T3SS of S. glossinidius in its endosymbiotic relationship with the tsetse fly host, although we acknowledge this requires experimental validation.	"Salmonella	72	82	Organism"	"tsetse fly	249	259	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""tsetse fly"", ""start_span"": 249, ""end_span"": 259, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The SsrB ortholog in S. glossinidius is approximately30% divergent with SsrB at the protein level, initially leading us to think that they might have different binding site preferences.

With the structure of SsrB available [ 32] and its recognized sequence now identified, future studies will be able to build a picture of how SsrB interacts with both its target DNA, RNA polymerase and potentially other transcription factors including nucleoid associated proteins in order to direct transcription of its regulon.

The DNA module that choreographs SsrB - mediated pathogenic behaviour in Salmonella appears to have been conserved for mutualism as well, thereby shedding new light on the significance of cis - regulatory mutations for bacteria evolving in different ecological settings.

Using a murine subcutaneous chamber model to sample the bacteria prior to selection or expansion of mutants, we compared gene expression dynamics of wild type ( WT) and previously isolated animal - passaged ( AP) covS mutant bacteria both in vitro and in vivo, and we found extensive transcriptional alterations of pathoadaptive and metabolic gene sets associated with invasion, immune evasion, tissue - dissemination, and metabolic reprogramming.

Whereas the overall mortality rate of GAS infections is less than 0. 1%, the mortality rate of invasive GAS infections, which have resurged in the past 30 years, mounts to 25% ( out of > 650, 000 new cases per year) [ 1].

Among these features is the ability of M1T1 bacteria to switch to a hypervirulent phenotype associated with invasive diseases in vivo [ 11], [ 12], [ 13], [ 14], a phenomenon that is not fully understood and whose specificity to the M1 serotype remains to be established [ 15].

CovR regulatory activity is thought to be triggered when the protein is phosphorylated at D53 [ 21], possibly by acetyl phosphate [ 22], [ 23].

On the other hand, under stress conditions, CovS dephosphorylates CovR and reverses virulence gene repression [ 21], [ 22].

One of the most striking outcomes of these mutations is the constitutive repression of a gene encoding the key GAS cysteine protease, SpeB, which remodels the host - pathogen interface [ 29] by differentially degrading bacterial surface and secreted proteins [ 12], [ 30], [ 31] as well as host proteins [ 32], [ 33], [ 34].

Additionally, the effects of covS mutations on bacterial niche adaptability are still undetermined because the in vivo transcriptomes of the wild type ( WT) and animal - passaged ( AP) bacteria have not been compared under the same experimental conditions.	"covS	29	33	Protein"	"AP	181	183	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""covS"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 181, ""end_span"": 183, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This difference in buoyancy can be attributed to differences in proteolytic activity ( WT > > AP) that may degrade many surface proteins, including pilin, or induce changes in the surface charge making bacterial aggregates more compact.	"AP	94	96	Organism"	"pilin	148	153	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""pilin"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The difference in buoyancy can also be attributed to differences in the expression of hyaluronic acid capsule ( AP > WT).	"hyaluronic acid	86	101	Chemical"	"AP	112	114	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""hyaluronic acid"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In this study, we designed and performed in vivo passage experiments in which equal loads of in vitro - grown WT and AP bacteria were separately inoculated into murine subcutaneous chambers [ 16] and collected by needle aspiration after 24 h, a time sufficient for the bacteria to sense the host environment and transcriptionally respond to it, but not long enough to allow detectable restructuring of the bacterial community and selection of mutants.	"AP	117	119	Organism"	"murine	161	167	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""murine"", ""start_span"": 161, ""end_span"": 167, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This pathovivogram highlights the transcriptional patterns that distinguish WT from AP bacteria regardless of their growth habitat ( pathogram, Fig 2. CC4 - CC6 and CC8 - CC10), and the transcriptional patterns that are shared by WT - vitro and AP - vitro bacteria but that differentiate them from their corresponding in vivo samples ( vivogram, Fig. 2, CC1 - CC3).

For example, in both the SLS operon and the Trx locus, we observed a striking difference between the effects of the covS mutation and the in vivo adaptation ( Fig. 4, CC6).

Of interest, among the genes of known function, 25% of those whose transcription was modulated as a consequence of the covS mutation are virulence - related and another 25% are related to carbohydrate metabolism pathways, which are connected to virulence in streptococci [ 44], [ 45], [ 46].	"covS	119	123	Protein"	"streptococci	258	270	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""covS"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""streptococci"", ""start_span"": 258, ""end_span"": 270, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Although CovS is expected to modulate many known CovR - repressed subsystems, certain operons may be differentially modulated or may be influenced by other regulator ( s).	"CovS	9	13	Protein"	"CovR	49	53	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CovS"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CovR"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Alternatively, the mutation in covS may have different effects on CovR - mediated regulation of different genes [ 26].	"covS	31	35	Protein"	"CovR	66	70	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""covS"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CovR"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Most genes within the Trx locus are downregulated in AP GAS relative to WT, but upregulated in the WT bacteria in vivo ( Fig. 2, CC6 and Fig. 3) suggesting the possibility of CovS - dependent in vivo signaling.	"AP GAS	53	59	Organism"	"CovS	175	179	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AP GAS"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""CovS"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 179, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In addition, the downregulation of SpeB, EndoS, and CAMP is in agreement with our previous proteomic results [ 12] as well as other published transcriptional analyses [ 13], [ 27].	"SpeB	35	39	Protein"	"EndoS	41	46	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SpeB"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""EndoS"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Interestingly, what this study revealed is that some of the downstream regulatory effects of the covS mutation in AP bacteria are only manifested in vivo.	"covS	97	101	Protein"	"AP	114	116	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""covS"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
For example, several gene sets ( e. g., SLS genes, Trx - locus genes, L - ascorbate utilization genes) were upregulated in WT bacteria in vivo, but were mostly silenced in AP bacteria in vivo ( Fig. 2, CC6).	"L - ascorbate	70	83	Chemical"	"AP	172	174	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""L - ascorbate"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 172, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This has been demonstrated by the larger number of genes affected during in vivo adaptation of both M1T1 variants compared to those affected by the covS mutation ( Table 2).	"M1T1	100	104	Organism"	"covS	148	152	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""M1T1"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""covS"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
( 2) The covS mutation in AP bacteria seems to be preferentially modulating virulence mechanisms, as about 25% of the known genes perturbed by the mutation belong to virulence subsystems ( Fig. 5) and many of the other perturbed genes are indirectly associated with virulence ( e. g., carbohydrate metabolism [ 66] and arginine utilization proteins [ 38]).

This dominant SpeB effect may explain why WT bacteria parish in vivo even though they partially downregulate SpeB transcription ( Table 3).	"SpeB	14	18	Protein"	"SpeB	109	113	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SpeB"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SpeB"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
An intact CovRS system would offer the bacteria enough versatility to turn on and off many regulatory networks through CovS signaling.

( 4) We also show that the impact of the covS mutation goes beyond the defined CovR regulon.

Finally, insertional inactivation of sak189 gene, but not sak188 gene, significantly affected virulent properties of S. agalactiae.

Briefly, DNA fragments of sak188 and sak189 genes were PCR amplified using pairs of primers hkFor, hkRev, and rrFor, rrRev ( Table 1), respectively.	"sak188	26	32	Protein"	"sak189	37	43	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""sak188"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak189"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
On the other hand, the bac gene transcription level in sak188 mutant strain was almost similar to that in the wild - type strain that confirmed the results of SDS - PAGE and western - blotting.	"bac	23	26	Protein"	"sak188	55	61	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bac"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak188"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, these data demonstrate that Sak189 protein regulates expression of beta - antigen at transcriptional level.

Finally, insertional inactivation of sak189 gene, but not sak188 gene, significantly affects virulent properties of S. agalactiae.	"sak189	37	43	Protein"	"sak188	58	64	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""sak189"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak188"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In some strains, the mutations in bac gene resulted in expression of truncated non - functional forms of beta - antigen [ 39], [ 40].	"bac	34	37	Protein"	"beta - antigen	105	119	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bac"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""beta - antigen"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In present study, the sak188 and sak189 genes of S. agalactiae were inactivated.	"sak188	22	28	Protein"	"sak189	33	39	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""sak188"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak189"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Given that insertional inactivation does not delete the entire gene from the chromosome and often results in truncated or modified protein, we analyzed which functional activities of Sak188 and Sak189 proteins could potentially retain if the modified proteins expressed.	"Sak188	183	189	Protein"	"Sak189	194	200	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sak188"", ""start_span"": 183, ""end_span"": 189, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Sak189"", ""start_span"": 194, ""end_span"": 200, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, we can not rule out the possibility of a cross - talk between Sak189 response regulator and sensor kinase ( s) in S. agalactiae, and Sak189 can potentially recruit another histidine kinase for proper functioning.	"Sak189	68	74	Protein"	"Sak189	139	145	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sak189"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Sak189"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Intraperitoneal infection of laboratory mice demonstrated that Sak189 DNA - binding response regulatory protein is important for virulent properties of S. agalactiae.	"mice	40	44	Organism"	"Sak189	63	69	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Sak189"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In the present study, insertional inactivation of sak189 gene abrogated beta - antigen expression but resulted in increased virulence ( Fig. 4).

Thus, we suggest that beta - antigen located on the bacterial surface can interfere with the disease process and play a role of anti - virulent factor ( at least, in mice) similarly to hyaluronate lyase of S. pyogenes [ 41].

The difference among the growth curves of the wild - type and mutant strains ( data not shown) indicate that in addition to bac gene, some metabolic genes can be controlled by Sak188 / Sak189 TCS.

This suggestion is confirmed by the numerous studies demonstrating the genome - wide location of the genes affected by TCSs [ 10], [ 42], [ 43], and set of the genes controlled by Sak188 / Sak189 ( TCS regulon) can be identified using microarray technology.

As seen from the data of this study, transcription of bac gene and expression of encoded beta - antigen are the primary genotypic / phenotypic properties controlled by Sak188 / Sak189 TCS.
