We used this approach to analyze microarray expression data from group A streptococci ( Streptococcus pyogenes) during adherence to human pharyngeal cells, the first overt infection step [ 7].

SpeB ( encoded by spy2039) is a multifunctional cysteine protease implicated in numerous infection strategies [ 28, 29].

Although few studies have examined gene expression patterns during adherence, SpeB production ( as detected by Western blot analysis) decreases during co - culture with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells [ 30] and in a mouse infection model [ 31].

Furthermore, SpeB abolishes internalization ( following adherence) of certain streptococcal strains by epithelial cells ( including Detroit 562 cells), a process mediated in part by the fibronectin - binding protein F [ 34, 35].

Although the delineation of genes influenced by RopB ( or any identified transcriptional regulator) is beyond the scope of this study, our initial analysis did identify the upregulation of a two - component regulatory system, encoded by spy1236 - 1237.	"RopB	48	52	Protein"	"spy1236	237	244	Protein"	"1237	247	251	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RopB"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""spy1236"", ""start_span"": 237, ""end_span"": 244, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""1237"", ""start_span"": 247, ""end_span"": 251, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
For example, we initially identified ( Table 1) the significant upregulation of three of the five known gene members of the folate biosynthetic pathway [ 40] ( spy1096 - 1100), but GenomeCrawler identified a significant cluster containing all five genes ( Table 3 and Figure 2B).

For example, the nine - gene operon that spans genes spy0738 - 0746 encodes streptolysin S, a potent cytolytic toxin that promotes internalization and host tissue dissemination [ 25, 44].	"spy0738	53	60	Protein"	"0746	63	67	Protein"	"streptolysin S	76	90	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""spy0738"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""0746"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""streptolysin S"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
For example, the streptolysin operon encodes an internal terminator downstream of the sagA gene ( the first gene in the operon), which modulates the abundance of particular mRNA species ( e. g., sagA mRNA versus the polycistronic message for all nine genes) under different environmental conditions [ 45].

Furthermore, the spy0128 - encoded protein is the structural backbone of the pili, and the gene product of spy0130 may be involved in stabilizing the structure [ 36].	"spy0128	17	24	Protein"	"gene product	91	103	Protein"	"spy0130	107	114	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""spy0128"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""gene product"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""spy0130"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Although operon - modeling methods exist [ 54, 55], we inspected clusters in silico for upstream regulatory elements and identified 17 candidates, including clusters such as streptolysin S that have been previously confirmed as operons [ 56]; the spy0127 - 0130 grouping, which was confirmed as an operon in this study; and others that have yet to be verified ( Table S6).

Earlier studies by the authors showed that FimA expression was modulated by environmental cues, including temperature and hemin concentration, and by the presence of Streptococcus cristatus, an early colonizer of dental plaque ( Xie et al., 1997, 2000b).

Coadhesion and biofilm development between P. gingivalis and Streptococcus gordonii require the interaction of Mfa1 with streptococcal protein SspB ( Park et al., 2005).

A recent study has shown that expression of mfa1 is repressed in the presence of some common oral plaque bacteria such as S. gordonii, Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus mitis ( Park et al., 2006).

To investigate effects of FimR on expression of the mfa1 gene, an insertional fimR mutant was constructed by allelic replacement.	"FimR	26	30	Protein"	"mfa1	52	56	Protein"	"fimR	78	82	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FimR"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mfa1"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fimR"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Expression of fimA and mfa1 in the fimR - mutant was determined using real - time PCR analysis.

The striking finding is that expression of the mfa1 gene was also repressed threefold in the fimR - mutant, although not to the degree observed with the fimA expression.	"mfa1	47	51	Protein"	"fimR	93	97	Protein"	"fimA	153	157	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""mfa1"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fimR"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fimA"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, the fimR - mutation had no effect on expression of rgpA, a gene encoding the arginine - specific protease, or the P. gingivalis 16S RNA gene.

This analysis suggests the FimS / FimR system is required for expression of both major and minor fimbriae.

Similarly, there was no apparent change in RgpA production in the fimR - mutant, which was detected by anti - RgpA serum.

One possibility is that FimR modulates mfa1 expression by directly binding to the promoter region of mfa1.

The mfa1 promoter ( positioned from + 18 to - 138), fimA promoter ( positioned from - 22 to - 190) ( Xie & Lamont, 1999) and mfa1 coding DNA ( positioned from + 1253 to + 1373) were generated by PCR with the 5 ' biotin - labeled primers ( Table 1).

The unlabeled mfa1 promoter fragments effectively competed with the labeled fragment, suggesting a specific interaction between rFimA and the mfa1 promoter.

To investigate the role of phosphorylation of FimR in its binding to the mfa1 promoter region, EMSA experiments were also performed with the phosphorylated rFimR.

These data clearly show that FimR protein can bind specifically to the mfa1 promoter region, acting as an activator of mfa1 transcription.

The biotin - labeled DNA fragment corresponding to this promoter region did not shift in the presence of the rFimA protein ( data not shown), suggesting that only the promoter identified here is involved for mfa1 expression mediated by FimR.

The observations that FimR binds only to the upstream promoter region of the mfa1 gene and that activity of the downstream promoter is inhibited by S. gordonii, S. sanguinis and S. mitis ( Park et al., 2006) imply the complexity of regulation of mfa1 expression.

From these experiments we concluded that complementation of H37Ra with the phoP wild - type copy partially restored its virulence, but not to the extent of the fully virulent H37Rv strain.

In contrast, no effects on the virulence were observed when H37Ra was complemented with fadE5 ( Figure 2) or rpsL ( unpublished data).

Together with the data from the macrophage infection assay, the results from the mouse infection show that the S219L mutation in the phoP gene definitely represents one genetic lesion that contributed to the attenuation of the H37Ra strain.	"mouse	81	86	Organism"	"phoP	133	137	Protein"	"H37Ra	227	232	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 227, ""end_span"": 232, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
As PhoP fulfills important regulatory functions in M. tuberculosis [ 21, 22], it was of primary interest to identify and study potential effector molecules whose involvement in host pathogen interaction were influenced by the point mutation in phoP of H37Ra.	"PhoP	3	7	Protein"	"phoP	244	248	Protein"	"H37Ra	252	257	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""PhoP"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 244, ""end_span"": 248, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 252, ""end_span"": 257, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Altogether, our data obtained from multiple replicate experiments indicate that a direct link exists between a fully functional PhoP and the ability to generate T cell responses against ESAT - 6 and CFP - 10.	"PhoP	128	132	Protein"	"ESAT - 6	186	194	Protein"	"CFP - 10	199	207	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PhoP"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 186, ""end_span"": 194, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CFP - 10"", ""start_span"": 199, ""end_span"": 207, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The western blot analysis presented in Figure 5 shows that the cell lysates of H37Ra and H37Ra:: rpsL contain large amounts of ESAT - 6, indicating that the antigen is properly expressed.	"H37Ra	79	84	Organism"	"rpsL	97	101	Protein"	"ESAT - 6	127	135	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""rpsL"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In contrast, from examination of the western blots of M. tuberculosis H37Ra:: phoP and H37Rv it is clear that a large portion of their ESAT - 6 protein is secreted into the culture filtrates.	"phoP	78	82	Protein"	"H37Rv	87	92	Organism"	"ESAT - 6	135	143	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""H37Rv"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Interestingly, expression of phoP was higher in H37Ra than in H37Rv ( Figure 6).	"phoP	29	33	Protein"	"H37Ra	48	53	Organism"	"H37Rv	62	67	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""H37Rv"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
They also indicate that it is not a lack of phoP expression that is causing the phoP - associated effects in H37Ra.	"phoP	44	48	Protein"	"phoP	80	84	Protein"	"H37Ra	109	114	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Steenken et al. have shown that the virulence of the H37 strain was associated with colony morphology and that the avirulent variant H37Ra failed to propagate in an ordinarily susceptible host while the virulent variant H37Rv was able to proliferate [ 6].	"H37	53	56	Organism"	"H37Ra	133	138	Organism"	"H37Rv	220	225	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""H37"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""H37Rv"", ""start_span"": 220, ""end_span"": 225, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Finally, microarray - based trancriptome analysis using the wild - type versus a phoP ko mutant of H37Rv has provided an overview of the transcriptional regulation linked to PhoP [ 21].	"phoP	81	85	Protein"	"H37Rv	99	104	Organism"	"PhoP	174	178	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""H37Rv"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""PhoP"", ""start_span"": 174, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This finding argues that the PhoP S219L mutation likely has a broad impact on gene regulation in H37Ra with effects similar to those seen for complete inactivation of phoP.	"PhoP	29	33	Protein"	"H37Ra	97	102	Organism"	"phoP	167	171	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PhoP"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 167, ""end_span"": 171, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Moreover, the expression values of genes rv3612c - rv3616c in H37Rv described in the article by Gao et al.	"rv3612c	41	48	Protein"	"rv3616c	51	58	Protein"	"H37Rv	62	67	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""rv3612c"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""rv3616c"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""H37Rv"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
As in previous DNA / DNA microarray analyses [ 10], and from inspection of the very recently released genome sequence of H37Ra, no significant differences in the ESX - 1 encoding region were found, the assumption that the observed lack of ESAT - 6 secretion in H37Ra may be caused by factors outside of the RD1 region is very plausible.	"H37Ra	121	126	Organism"	"ESAT - 6	239	247	Protein"	"H37Ra	261	266	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 239, ""end_span"": 247, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 261, ""end_span"": 266, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In contrast, in another transcriptome analysis, Mostowy and colleagues [ 11] found several genes of the RD1 region, including that encoding ESAT - 6, among the genes that were at least 2. 5 - fold lower expressed in H37Ra than in H37Rv.	"ESAT - 6	140	148	Protein"	"H37Ra	216	221	Organism"	"H37Rv	230	235	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 216, ""end_span"": 221, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""H37Rv"", ""start_span"": 230, ""end_span"": 235, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Our results obtained for ESAT - 6 expression ( Figure 5) and the transcriptome data from Gao and colleagues [ 12] argue against direct downregulation of ESAT - 6 in H37Ra.	"ESAT - 6	25	33	Protein"	"ESAT - 6	153	161	Protein"	"H37Ra	165	170	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 170, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Thus, our results once more emphasize the great importance of the ESX - 1 system for tubercle bacilli and provide important new information about the phoP - associated virulence regulation in M. tuberculosis.	"ESX - 1	66	73	Protein"	"tubercle bacilli	85	101	Organism"	"phoP	150	154	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ESX - 1"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""tubercle bacilli"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The role of PhoP / PhoQ in regulating virulence gene expression has been characterized mainly in Salmonella species, but has also been shown, in addition to three other TCSs, to be important for virulence of Y. pseudotuberculosis [ 29, 30].	"PhoP	12	16	Protein"	"PhoQ	19	23	Protein"	"Salmonella	97	107	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""PhoP"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PhoQ"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
They produce membrane diffusible signalling molecules, acyl homoserine lactones ( AHLs), which are sensed by the receptor / regulator LuxR when exceeding a threshold concentration.	"acyl homoserine lactones	55	79	Chemical"	"AHLs	82	86	Chemical"	"LuxR	134	138	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""acyl homoserine lactones"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""AHLs"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""LuxR"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This suggests that P. luminescens does not produce its own AHL signalling molecule, but might be able to sense those produced by other bacteria and therefore to detect mixed microbial communities as demonstrated for Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli [ 35 - 37].	"AHL	59	62	Chemical"	"Salmonella enterica	216	235	Organism"	"Escherichia coli	240	256	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""AHL"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""Salmonella enterica"", ""start_span"": 216, ""end_span"": 235, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Escherichia coli"", ""start_span"": 240, ""end_span"": 256, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
35 of these potential LuxR - like receptors exhibit PAS _ 4 signal binding domains instead of an AHL - binding domain, and two have a signalling domain with a yet unidentified motif ( Fig. 3).	"LuxR	22	26	Protein"	"PAS _ 4	52	59	Protein"	"AHL	97	100	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""LuxR"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PAS _ 4"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""AHL"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Interestingly, eleven of those LuxR - like receptors are present in Y. enterocolitica of which five are located in a cluster ( ye0035 - 0039).	"LuxR	31	35	Protein"	"ye0035	127	133	Protein"	"0039	136	140	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LuxR"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ye0035"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""0039"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Homologues of these proteins are also present in P. aeruginosa, namely PA4352 and PA3309, a tandem - type Usp protein and a UspA - like protein, respectively.	"PA4352	71	77	Protein"	"PA3309	82	88	Protein"	"UspA	124	128	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PA4352"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PA3309"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""UspA"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In P. luminescens, expression of UspA has been shown to be under control of the AstS / AstR TCS, which is important for the correct timing of phase variant switching [ 28].	"UspA	33	37	Protein"	"AstS	80	84	Protein"	"AstR	87	91	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""UspA"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""AstS"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""AstR"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Because Y. enterocolitica produces the corresponding TCS BvgS / BvgR, but is not known to switch to another phenotypic variant, the possible role of UspA in global regulation still remains to be elucidated.	"BvgS	57	61	Protein"	"BvgR	64	68	Protein"	"UspA	149	153	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BvgS"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""BvgR"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""UspA"", ""start_span"": 149, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In Y. enterocolitica, the transcriptional repressor RovM ( YE1343) is similar to HexA of P. luminescens ( 61% identity and 75% homology), and has only recently been shown to control cell invasion, virulence and motility in Y. pseudotuberculosis, Y. pestis and Y. enterocolitica [ 51 - 53].

A GroEL homologue is present in P. luminescens ( Plu4134) which the P. luminescens UspG homologues might interact with.	"GroEL	2	7	Protein"	"Plu4134	49	56	Protein"	"UspG	83	87	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GroEL"", ""start_span"": 2, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Plu4134"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""UspG"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In contrast to P. luminescens, Y. enterocolitica encodes another member of the UspA subfamily, the UspC homologue YE2583 ( Tab. 2), which is not present in P. luminescens.	"UspA	79	83	Protein"	"UspC	99	103	Protein"	"YE2583	114	120	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""UspA"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""UspC"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""YE2583"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The UspA and the UspE homologues are predicted here to be relevant for insect infection, whereas UspC is assumed be more important for Y. enterocolitica in other environments / hosts.

Proteins containing a so - called GGDEF domain are responsible for the synthesis of c - di - GMP, and those with a so - called EAL domain for its degradation.

The PilZ domain is found as a stand - alone domain or in combination with GGDEF, EAL and other domains, thus assumed to function also as an allosteric domain to control other regulatory enzymes [ 58, 59].

The expression of two of those EAL - domain containing proteins, YE4063 and YE1324, is induced at low temperature ( Tab. 1).

P. luminescens contains no protein with GGDEF, EAL or PilZ domain.

Tc homologues have also been described to be present in Yersinia spp. and in other insect - associated bacteria such as Serratia entomophila and Xenorhabdus nematophilus [ 62, 63].

P. luminescens and Y. enterocolitica TPS systems include the calcium - independent hemolysin PhlA that is transported through the outer membrane and activated by PhlB.

Remarkably, their expression is induced by low iron concentration as encountered in the insect host, and phlA / phlB are up - regulated at 18degreesC compared to 28degreesC in Y. ruckeri [ 66].

FhaC which belongs to a family of hemolysin activator proteins related to ShlA from Serratia marcescens is present in both pathogens and also induced at low temperature [ 67].

Although it can not be excluded that the hemolysins of Y. enterocolitica act on the immune systems of both the insect and the mammalian host, the genetic overlap of this group of virulence factor between both pathogens, and the low - temperature expression of YE0479 / YE0480 and fhaC, indicates the presence of insect - specific hemolysins in the genome of Y. enterocolitica.

Expression of genes was upregulated by a loss of repressive function with the mutation of csrS gene in the all emm49 severe invasive GAS isolates.

In the present study, we aimed to explore the crucial factors in the pathogenesis of severe invasive GAS infections in the context of PMN - GAS relationship, using a panel of emm49 clinical isolates from patients with or without severe invasive infection, and their gene - manipulated mutants.

We further determined CsrS mutations in the severe invasive GAS was essential to control the expression of various virulence genes and contributed to the in vivo virulence and disease - specific pathophysiology in a mouse model.

As non - opsonized GAS was resistant to the phagocytosis by PMN [ 14], we opsonized GAS with human plasma in advance to the assay.

PMN death was induced shortly after encounter with severe invasive GAS, and PMN were not in apoptotic death because of low frequency of cells positive for annexin V ( data not shown), which was seen in the case of cytolysin - dependent cell injury [ 15].

Therefore, to know the mechanism underlying GAS - mediated killing of PMN, we investigated whether SLO produced by invasive GAS affect survival of PMN in an in vitro migration assay system.

Figure 3A shows that PMN killing by invasive GAS was blocked by anti - SLO Ab in culture medium within lower wells of a transwell system ( p = 0. 018 compared with control Ig), at similar extent by adding free cholesterol in the medium ( data not shown).

As shown in Figure 3C, SLO activity of severe invasive isolate NIH230 is increased as twice as that of non - invasive strain 1566 ( p = 0. 017).

Therefore, we quantified the amount of IL - 8 in culture before and after co - culture with clinically isolated GAS or its mutants.

These results demonstrate that clinically isolated invasive GAS impaired PMN recruitment and its survival, as a result of productions of ScpC and SLO, respectively.

These results demonstrate the prominent changes in the transcriptional profile of several virulence - associated genes, including the slo and the scpC, in the all severe invasive GAS.

Mutation of csrR or csrS can cause significant alterations in virulence in mouse models of infection, either increasing lethality or the severity of localized soft tissue lesions [ 5], [ 6].

The nucleotide sequence of the csrR gene was identical in all the isolates, and that of the csrS gene was identical among the all non - invasive GAS isolates ( data not shown).

Contrarily, no significant pathological alterations were observed in the mice injected with the 1566 and NIH230:: csrS + strains ( Figure 7B and 7C).

Figure 7D shows that subcutaneous infection of NIH230 formed the infected lesions with area significantly larger than those of 1566 and NIH230:: csrS +.

These results suggest that the invasive GAS isolates are more virulent in vivo than non - invasive GAS, and impair PMN function in vivo, owing, at least in part, to the mutations in the csrS gene.

Finally, we assessed the influence of enhanced expression of the scpC or the slo gene on the virulence in a mouse model.

As shown in Table 1, NIH230scpC and NIH230slo exerted the LD50 value 3 - 10 fold lower than that of the non - invasive isolate 1566, but 10 - 30 fold higher than that of severe invasive isolates.

The present study demonstrate that the loss - of - functional mutations in csrS gene which were accumulated in clinically isolated GAS from patients with severe invasive infections, but not with emm - matched non - invasive strains.

The csrS mutations enhanced the expression of scpC and slo, associated with the evasion of PMN functions and in vivo virulence.

Then we further examined whether severe invasive isolates of other than emm49 genotype have the mutation of the csrS and the csrR genes.

This dominant role of CsrS is the first important observation in this study, and its mutation is possibly more important than that of csrR in terms of etiopathogenesis of human severe invasive diseases.

Extracellular deoxyribonuclease ( DNase) is a virulence factor that protects emm1 type GAS against neutrophil killing by degrading the DNA framework of neutrophil extracelluar traps ( NETs) [ 25], [ 26].

However, we confirmed that addition of DNase in the culture did not alter the level of PI - positive PMN, meaning bright PI staining of PMN is not due to release of NETs from PMN ( Figure S1A).

DNase activity of the emm49 severe invasive GAS was lower than that of non - invasive GAS ( Figure S1B), possibly due to the difference of emm type.

The present study also uncovers that increased activity of SLO from invasive GAS isolates induces rapid and extensive necrosis to human PMN.

In contrast to the previous view [ 18], we observed that both of ScpC and SLO together, but not each of them, mediated sufficient in vivo virulence ( Table 1), thus compatible with the notion that plural virulence - associated factors under the regulation of csrS abrogate PMN bactericidal functions and induce invasive diseases in in vivo animal model.

Consistently, the high mortality and histopathological findings which lacks PMN infiltration in mice tissues infected with csrS - mutated GAS ( Figure 7) are similar to those seen in clinical invasive GAS infections [ 32].

Several clinical reports seem to support this hypothesis; Leukocytopenia seen in patients with STSS is more severe than that with non - STSS [ 33], and invasive GAS - infected patients with leukocytopenia show worse prognosis than those without leukocytopenia [ 33], [ 34].

Furthermore, DNA - induced expression of this operon resulted in up to 2560 - fold increased resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides and 640 - fold increased resistance to aminoglycosides, but had no effect on beta - lactam and fluoroquinolone resistance.

Alginate production has been shown to inhibit phagocytic killing of Pseudomonas, to protect from antibiotic exposure [ 13], [ 14], and is associated with poor prognosis for the infected patients [ 15], [ 16].

Additionally, the hybrid sensor kinases, LadS and RetS appear to work upstream of GacA to possibly control the switch to a biofilm lifestyle [ 34], [ 35].

These genes encode an LPS modification pathway required for the addition of aminoarabinose to lipid A, which reduces the OM permeability to CAPs [ 48].

One percent ( w / v) extracellular DNA in LB also inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Burkholderia cenocepacia ( data not shown), suggesting that the antimicrobial activity of DNA is not unique to P. aeruginosa.

The OM of P. aeruginosa contains a 20: 1 ratio of Mg2 +: Ca2 + cations [ 59], which bind to and stabilize LPS in the outer leaflet of the OM [ 58].

In a similar manner, the addition of excess Mg2 +, Ca2 + and Mn2 + restored growth of P. aeruginosa in BM2 media.

The increased protection observed following addition of Mg2 + and Ca2 + is likely due to their importance in membrane integrity where they function to stabilize the OM by crosslinking adjacent LPS molecules [ 58].

Since Mg2 + limitation has been shown to be associated with CAP resistance in P. aeruginosa [ 44], [ 45], [ 47], we sought to determine if Mg2 + chelation by DNA may account, at least in part, for the increased antibiotic resistance observed in biofilms.

Double staining of P. aeruginosa with syto9 ( stains viable cells green) and the extracellular DNA stain DDAO ( red) [ 51] was used to visualize DNA as a loose lattice in biofilms formed on polystyrene pegs after 24 h ( Fig 5A).

At sub - lethal concentrations, extracellular DNA imposes a cation limitation that leads to induction of PA3553 ( Fig 4A), which can be repressed by excess Mg2 + ( Fig 4B), indicating that P. aeruginosa senses Mg2 +.

The CAP resistance phenotype of biofilms grown in limiting magnesium ( 20 microM) was similar to biofilms grown in DNA, confirming that DNA imposes a magnesium limitation stress ( Table 2).

However, our data indicates that the presence of DNA in biofilms does indeed result in a cation - limited environment, resulting in the induction of the LPS modification operon PA3552 - PA3559.

It is also known that CF airway fluid contains high levels of neutrophil defensins [ 77] and that sub - lethal doses of CAPs induce PA3553 gene expression, although independently of PhoPQ and PmrAB [ 45].

Furthermore, these findings indicate that DNA - rich environments, such as bacterial biofilms or the CF lung, may represent the natural setting where bacterial growth is cation limited, and highlight the importance of the PhoPQ / PmrAB controlled response and LPS modifications in antibiotic resistance in biofilms.

To test whether DeltavicK infection confers immunity against S. equi infection, the seven mice recovered from the subcutaneous DeltavicK infection was reinfected subcutaneously with 1. 5 x 108 cfu wild - type S. equi 30 days after the first infection and monitored for 18 days.

However, the DeltavicK mutant is attenuated in virulence in both mouse models of subcutaneous and intranasal S. equi infections, indicating that VicRK is important to virulence.

S. equi DeltavicK mutant does not grow as well as the wild - type strain in both THY and blood, suggesting that the vicK deletion causes defect in growth, a plausible reason that likely contributes to the attenuation of S. equi virulence in the mouse infection models.

Small differences in intracellular growth were observed for ssrA / ssrB and slyA compared to the parent although larger differences have been observed previously [ 43] - [ 45] perhaps reflecting BMDM preparation techniques, bacterial strain differences, or opsonization differences [ 46].

The Mycobacterium tuberculosis universal stress protein ( USP) homolog, rv2623, is among the most highly induced genes when the tubercle bacillus is subjected to hypoxia and nitrosative stress, conditions thought to promote latency.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rv2623 regulates growth in vitro An rv2623 - deletion mutant of the virulent M. tuberculosis Erdman strain was generated by specialized transduction [ 12].

The rv2623 - specific allelic exchange construct was delivered via recombinant mycobacteriophage phAE159 and transformants were analyzed by Southern blot, confirming replacement of rv2623 with the hyg gene, which confers hygromycin resistance ( Figure 1A).

However, the in vitro growth kinetics of Deltarv2623 M. tuberculosis in OADC - supplemented Middlebrook 7H9 or minimal Sauton ' s medium is comparable to that of wildtype Erdman up to 14 days post - inoculation ( Figure 2A).

Guinea pigs are able to control the growth of Erdman bacilli following the onset of adaptive immunity at approximately3 weeks post - infection, as evident by the relatively stable pulmonary bacterial burden beyond the 3 week time point, yet levels of Deltarv2623 bacilli continued to increase at a reduced but steady rate resulting in a rapidly progressing infection.

This increase in lung pathology was also largely reversed in animals infected with the complemented Deltarv2623 attB:: Phsp60Rv2623 strain ( Figure 3B and C).

Thus, the hypervirulence phenotype of Deltarv2623 observed in the susceptible guinea pig model could have been masked in the C57BL / 6 mice.

Together, the animal studies provide strong evidence that Rv2623 regulates the growth of M. tuberculosis in vivo: in the absence of Rv2623, the tubercle bacillus fails to establish a chronic persistent infection, exhibiting a hypervirulent phenotype.

On the basis of structures of ATP - binding and non - ATP - binding USPs, a G - 2X - G - 9X - G ( S / T) motif was suggested to be essential for the binding of ATP [ 27].

Structure - based sequence alignments of both Rv2623 domains with the N631 consensus suggest that domain 2, which exhibits significantly higher conservation than domain 1 across global and ATP - binding subfamily consensus sequences, represents the ancestral domain among ATP - binding USPs with tandem - type architectures.

Likewise, following an overnight incubation with [ alpha - 33P] ATP at 4degreesC, the amount of protein - bound radioactivity, which represented a very small fraction of the total ATP binding sites, was significantly less for the mutant proteins than wild - type Rv2623 ( data not shown).

It is therefore likely that the D15E and G117A mutations produced local structural changes in the ATP binding loops that contributed directly to the reduced levels of bound ATP in comparing to wild - type Rv2623.

Results of these studies demonstrated that while overexpression of wildtype Rv2623 retards the growth of the recipient strain relative to cells transformed with vector alone, growth of the strains overexpressing ATP - binding - deficient mutant Rv2623 are only minimally affected by overexpression as assessed by spotting serial dilutions of the cultures of the appropriate strains onto solid Middlebrook 7H10 agar ( data not shown) as well as by monitoring the time to detection using the BD BACTEC 9000MB system ( Figure 8A).

While the non - ATP - binding UspA homologs appear to play diverse roles in promoting survival under a variety of environmental insults [ 15], [ 49], [ 50], [ 51], the function ( s) of ATP - binding type USPs remain unclear [ 9].

Based on in silico analyses, Florczyk et al. classified Rv2623 as belonging to a novel class of ATPases [ 52], although formal evidence for ATP binding by this protein has not been reported.

Furthermore, given that the attenuated growth phenotype caused by overexpression of Rv2623 could be abrogated by mutations that interfere with the binding of this protein to its nucleotide substrate, it is likely that the mycobacterial growth - regulatory faculty of Rv2623 is mediated by an ATP - dependent function.

It has been proposed that a nucleotide - binding USP from M. jannaschii, MJ0577, whose ability to hydrolyze ATP is dependent on interaction with factor ( s) present in the cell extract of this hyperthermophile [ 26], functions as a molecular switch much like the Ras protein family, whose GTP hydrolysis ability is modulated by interaction with a number of regulatory proteins [ 53], [ 54], [ 55].

It is therefore conceivable that M. tuberculosis Rv2623, as a component of the yet - to - be defined dormancy signaling pathway ( s), functions as a molecular switch by virtue of its ATP - binding and putative ATP - hydrolyzing properties, to mediate the establishment of tuberculous latency.

Inactivation of bfiS, bfmR, and mifR arrested biofilm formation at the transition to the irreversible attachment, maturation - 1 and - 2 stages, respectively, as indicated by analyses of biofilm architecture, and protein and phosphoprotein patterns.

Moreover, discontinuation of bfiS, bfmR, and mifR expression in established biofilms resulted in the collapse of biofilms to an earlier developmental stage, indicating a requirement for these regulatory systems for the development and maintenance of normal biofilm architecture.

These systems together form a coordinated signaling network that regulates three committed steps of the P. aeruginosa biofilm life cycle, in particular the transition to three later biofilm developmental stages following initial attachment, namely initiation of biofilm formation ( BfiRS), biofilm maturation ( BfmRS), and microcolony formation ( MifRS).

As PA4197, PA4101 and GacS were all phosphorylated by 24 hr of biofilm growth, we asked whether the three proteins are modified simultaneously or in a sequential manner.

PA4101 expression was detected to be biofilm - specific, while PA4197 and PA5511 were constitutively expressed regardless of the mode of growth ( Suppl. Fig. S4).

However, when placed in a PAO1 background ( PAO1 / pJN5511), overexpression of PA5511 resulted in biofilms composed of large microcolonies exceeding 250 microm in diameter ( compared to an average cluster diameter of 150 microm in P. aeruginosa PAO1, Fig. 2A, D).

To exclude the possibility that the DeltabfiS, DeltabfmR, and DeltamifR mutant biofilms may have disaggregated prematurely, the formation of mutant biofilms was monitored daily by confocal microscopy over a period of 144 hr.

The finding is consistent with our observation of GacS playing a dual role in biofilm formation, with phosphorylation acting as a switch in the function of GacS ( Fig. 3, Table 2): GacS participates in the planktonic / biofilm switch in its non - phosphorylated state, but limits / regulates the rate of biomass accumulation and biofilm development when phosphorylated.

In turn, expression of the BfiS cognate response regulator, BfiR, was found to be RsmA dependent [ 77] ( see Fig. 6).

Crystallographic analysis of SrcA at a resolution of 2. 5 A revealed a dimer similar to the CesT chaperone from enteropathogenic E. coli but lacking a 17 - amino acid extension at the carboxyl terminus.

Using competitive infections in mice we show that SrcA increases bacterial fitness during host infection, highlighting the in vivo importance of effector chaperones for the SPI - 2 T3SS.

Many Gram - negative bacteria that colonize host animals use a type III secretion system ( T3SS) to deliver effector proteins directly into host cells where their interaction with host proteins and membranes contribute to pathogenesis.

Crystal structures have been determined for three chaperones that coordinate translocation of effectors through the SPI - 1 T3SS ( InvB [ 11], SicP [ 12] and SigE [ 13]).

To determine the cellular distribution of SrcA we constructed a srcA - HA allele and expressed this gene in wild type and in ssrB mutant cells under conditions that activate the SPI - 2 T3SS [ 24].

As a positive control, SseC, an SsrB - regulated translocon protein of the SPI - 2 T3SS was present in the secreted fraction from wild type cells but not from an ssrB mutant.

To verify the role of srcA on this phenotype, we complemented the srcA mutant with a wild type srcA gene under the control of its endogenous promoter, which restored in vivo fitness to that of wild type ( Fig. 1D).

Sequence analysis showed 59% amino acid identity between SrcA and CesT, a secretion chaperone in enteropathogenic E. coli ( EPEC) ( Fig. 2A).

CesT and SicP were the most structurally similar to SrcA, aligning with RMSD of 1. 8 A and 2. 2 A respectively.

CesT, SicP and SrcA contain several clusters of highly conserved amino acids notable on primary sequence alignments ( Fig. 2A).

Binding of SptP occurs primarily in the N - terminus of SicP [ 12], which is similar to the effector binding surface for SrcA predicted in silico.

SseL was immunoprecipitated specifically along with SrcA - FLAG with a SILAC ratio of 0. 08, whereas additional abundant proteins displayed SILAC ratios closer to approximately1 ( OmpF is shown, Fig. 5B) ( mean SILAC ratio of all other peptides identified was 0. 93 ( Dataset S1).

Using this approach SseL - HA and PipB2 - HA were depleted from the secreted protein fraction of srcA mutant cells ( Fig. 5C) but reached similar levels in the bacterial cytoplasm ( Fig. 5D).

SrcA is required for PipB2 - dependent centrifugal displacement of the Salmonella - containing vacuole	"SrcA	0	4	Protein"	"PipB2	21	26	Protein"	"Salmonella	71	81	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""SrcA"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PipB2"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In enteropathogenic E. coli, a surface - exposed electronegative residue in the CesT chaperone ( Glu142) likewise contributes to Tir secretion but not Tir binding [ 16], suggesting a role in either targeting bound cargo to the T3SS or in the secretion process itself.	"CesT	80	84	Protein"	"Tir	129	132	Protein"	"Tir	151	154	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CesT"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Tir"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Tir"", ""start_span"": 151, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Interestingly, SrcA lacks 17 - amino acids that make up the carboxyl terminus of CesT, which includes Glu142, and yet it still retains effector binding, ATPase binding and effector secretion functionalities.	"SrcA	15	19	Protein"	"carboxyl	60	68	Chemical"	"CesT	81	85	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SrcA"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""carboxyl"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""CesT"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, it is likely that other surface charged residues of SrcA are involved in these functions or that SrcA targets effector cargo to the secretion apparatus through a mechanism distinct from CesT.

The interface for the SrcA homodimer is extensive and is more in keeping with the structural features of single - effector class IA chaperones ( approximately1100 - 1300 A2) compared to the reduced dimer interface of Spa15, a multi - cargo class IB chaperone from Shigella [ 31].

Similar to CesT and SicP, the dimer interface of SrcA adopts a parallel configuration when comparing alpha2 helices of opposing subunits.

The expression of srcA is coordinated with T3SS transcriptional activity via the SsrA - SsrB two - component regulatory system encoded in SPI - 2.

We recently described this type of regulatory evolution for pathogenic adaptation of Salmonella to its host [ 21] and srcA is consistent with regulatory evolution of chaperone - effector gene pairs that are not co - transcribed in operons.

Interestingly, STM2137 ( also known as SseK2) is a likely paralog of SseK1, an effector translocated by the SPI - 2 T3SS [ 33].

As it alternates between fleas and mammals, it is postulated that Y. pestis regulates gene expression appropriately to adapt to the two disparate host environments, and that different sets of genes are required to produce a transmissible infection in the flea and disease in the mammal.

Comparing the Y. pestis gene expression profile in the flea to those of in vitro biofilm and planktonic cells cultured at the low temperature typical of the flea implicated several genes in a flea - specific adaptive response and in proventricular blockage.

Transcriptional profile of Y. pestis in the flea Little is known about the environmental conditions in the flea digestive tract, how Y. pestis adapts to them, or the physiological state of the bacteria at transmission when they exit the flea and enter the mammal.

As Y. pestis does not have homologs of genes required to produce GABA or HPA, these metabolites may be taken up from the flea digestive tract.

Alternatively, the gabD and gabT gene products might act in the reverse direction to synthesize GABA, which has osmoprotective properties [ 13].

Acquisition of pentoses from the environment may be important because Y. pestis does not possess glucose 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase activity, the first step of the pentose phosphate pathway [ 19].

In summary, Y. pestis appears to use amino acids, particularly the L - glutamate family, as primary carbon, nitrogen, and energy sources in the flea.

Amino acid carbon is presumably funneled into the TCA cycle, the genes for which are highly expressed in the flea ( Table S3).

Y. pestis homologs of two genes with previously identified roles in biofilm, yidE, which encodes a hyperadherence factor in E. coli [ 27], and cpxP, a member of the cpxPAR ESR system, were upregulated in the flowcell; but predicted adhesin genes were not upregulated.

About 15% of Y. pestis genes showed significantly higher relative expression levels or expression only in the flea than in the bubo; 24% were more highly expressed in the bubo than in the flea; and 61% were not differentially expressed in the two hosts ( Fig. 3).

The analysis also reinforces the model that Y. pestis produces a hexaacylated lipid A in the flea, and that the change to the less immunostimulatory tetraacylated form occurs only after transmission [ 32].

Other virulence and transmission factors were not differentially regulated, including the hms genes; and the Y. pestis plasminogen activator ( pla), critical for dissemination from extravascular tissue at the fleabite site [ 33], and ymt were highly expressed in both hosts ( Table S3 and [ 11]).

yitR, a LysR - type regulator that activates the Tc - like yit genes [ 50], was upregulated > 10 - fold in the flea, but its expression was not detected in the rat bubo ( Table 1).

The specific induction in the flea of yitR and genes in the adjacent Tc - like yit and yip loci suggests that they are involved in adaptation to and colonization of the flea.

The upregulation of the innate immunity resistance genes phoP and mgtC suggest that those Y. pestis that are phagocytized may be prepared for resistance to CAMPs and intracellular survival while still in the flea vector.

Finally, the major essential virulence factors yadBC and pla, essential for Y. pestis dissemination from the dermis, were maximally or very highly expressed in the flea ( Tables 1, S3).

Background The two - component BvrR / BvrS system is essential for Brucella abortus virulence.

To determine the genes regulated by BvrR / BvrS, we performed a whole - genome microarray analysis using B. abortus RNA obtained from wild type and bvrR mutant cells grown in the same conditions.	"BvrR	36	40	Protein"	"BvrS	43	47	Protein"	"bvrR	148	152	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BvrR"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""BvrS"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""bvrR"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Up to now, BvrR / BvrS is the best characterized two - component regulatory system of Brucella [ 2] - [ 4].

BvrR is a cytoplasmic protein that shows significant similarity to OmpR / PhoB subfamily of response regulator proteins with a specific Asp residue located within a conserved regulatory domain and an effector domain with DNA - binding activity [ 5].

Although genome sequencing has revealed 21 putative two - component regulatory systems in the Brucella genus, the best characterized one implicated in virulence is the BvrR / BvrS system.	"Brucella	94	102	Organism"	"BvrR	168	172	Protein"	"BvrS	175	179	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Brucella"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""BvrR"", ""start_span"": 168, ""end_span"": 172, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""BvrS"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 179, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
BvrR / bvrS mutants are avirulent in mice, have increased susceptibility to killing by nonimmune serum, show reduced invasiveness to epithelial cells and macrophages, and are incapable of inhibiting lysosome fusion and of intracellular replication [ 4].

B. abortus mutants in this system were more susceptible to bactericidal polycationic substances like polymyxin B, melittin or poly - L - lysine, and displayed a more hydrophobic outer membrane surface than the parental strain [ 4].

To further understand the role of the BvrR / BvrS two - component signal transduction system, global gene expression profiles were analyzed by using ORFeome - based Brucella whole - genome DNA microarrays and confirmed by reverse transcription - PCR ( RT - PCR).	"BvrR	38	42	Protein"	"BvrS	45	49	Protein"	"Brucella	165	173	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""BvrR"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""BvrS"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Brucella"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Brucella mutants in the BvrR / BvrS two - component regulatory system are pleiotropic [ 3] - [ 6].

Whole - genome microarray analysis was made to determine the effect of the mutation in BvrR / BvrS in the gene expression pattern of Brucella.	"BvrR	87	91	Protein"	"BvrS	94	98	Protein"	"Brucella	133	141	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""BvrR"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""BvrS"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Brucella"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These data confirm that BvrR / BvrS regulates bacterial envelope changes that could modify surface properties relevant for Brucella virulence [ 6].

In addition, the complete maltose transport system of Brucella, which consists in a large operon containing thirteen genes ( BAB1 _ 0236 - 0248) was also affected.

To determine if the BvrR / BvrS system affects the metabolism, bvrR mutant and wild type strains were grown in synthetic minimal media.	"BvrR	20	24	Protein"	"BvrS	27	31	Protein"	"bvrR	63	67	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BvrR"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""BvrS"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""bvrR"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Since Brucella is an intracellular facultative pathogen, the bacteria could use these denitrification reactions to grow under low - oxygen condition by respiration of nitrate.

Brucella may also take advantage of denitrification to cope with nitric oxide ( NO) production in the macrophage during the innate response against infection.

Genes encoding proteins related to the PTS, including a HPr Ser - kinase, an EIIA permease of the mannose family and a HPr homologue precede those of the two - component regulatory system.

A link between carbon and nitrogen metabolism, PTS and two - component regulatory systems have been proposed for some bacteria [ 18], and our microarray results strongly suggest that same relationship could be made for Brucella.

All these data suggest that VjbR, similarly to the BvrR / BvrS system, is involved in the control of outer membrane composition and virulence.

Further analysis indicated that both the ExoR protein and the ExoS / ChvI two - component regulatory system are involved in the regulation of both polysaccharides and flagellum biosynthesis [ 31].

In addition, the transcription of the S. meliloti lpsS gene, that encodes a sulfotransferase that modifies LPS, is dependent on the exoR gene [ 32].	"lpsS	50	54	Protein"	"LPS	107	110	Chemical"	"exoR	132	136	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""lpsS"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""LPS"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""exoR"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Our results also support this hypothesis: the functional relationship between the exoR gene and the BvrR / BvrS system.

BvrR / bvrS mutants are unable to multiply intracellularly and are avirulent in the mouse model [ 4].

Most of the genes candidate to be regulated by BvrR / BvrS identified in our microarray experiments can be involved with the changes needed for intracellular survival of Brucella.

In conclusion, all these results and previous findings support the proposal that BvrR / BvrS controls a significantly broad set of phenotypes and define an important and coordinate gateway between the free - living and intracellular states of Brucella.

This protein also has the endopeptidase activity against human immunoglobulin G ( IgG), and the Cys94, His262 and Asp284 are critical for the enzymatic activity.

Gram - positive bacterium Streptococcus equi subspeices equi ( S. equi) causes equine strangles, a highly contagious purulent lymphadenitis and one of the most common infectious diseases in horses [ 1, 2].

This protein can cleave the heavy chain of human immunoglobulin G ( IgG) using Cys94, His262 and Asp284 as its catalytic triad [ 6 - 8].

Due to the unavailability of other purified subgroup IgG, it is not known whether SeMac cleaves the other IgG subgroups.

The bacteria were labeled with FITC, treated with S. equi - specific horse convalescent serum in the absence or presence of SeMac, and incubated with horse blood.

But the inclusion of SeMac in the assay did not affect opsonophagocytosis of S. equi ( Fig. 5A), suggesting that SeMac does not inhibit opsonophagocytosis of S. equi by horse PMNs.

Timoney et al. recently reported that IdeE / SeMac reduces the bactericidal activity of isolated equine PMNs for S. equi [ 19].

SeMac is not produced in vitro, whereas GAS Mac is [ 16].

This suggestion is supported by only 29% DNA sequence identity between S. equi and M1 GAS in the upstream region of the semac and mac genes.
