This conclusion is based on our observations that ( i) aprA mutants show attenuated virulence, ( ii) aprA mutants survive less well than wild - type P. entomophila in Drosophila and are more sensitive to Imd - mediated defense, and ( iii) AprA provides specific protection in vivo against Diptericin.

This finding is in accordance with previous observations that CovR and CovS are not committed to each other, as CovR could be phosphorylated in the absence of a functional CovS [ 22] and as different covS mutations, albeit clustered in the histidine kinase domain, might have different transcriptional effects [ 27], including opposite effects on different members of the CovR regulon [ 26].

It could be predicted given that inactivation of other S. agalactiae TCSs ( CovS / CovR, DltR / DltS, RgfA / RgfC) resulted in the changes of virulent properties, however, in all these studies the mutant strains became less virulent compared to the wild - type strains [ 8] - [ 12].
