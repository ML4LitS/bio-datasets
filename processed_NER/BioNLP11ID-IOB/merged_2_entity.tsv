It is interesting to note that there is only one bacterium else, the insect colonizing S. glossinidius, whose genome also carries a series of unclustered genes coding for PAS _ 4 / LuxR - like receptors, indicating that this kind of receptors plays a role during insect infection.

Phenotypic variation and thus the switch between mutualism and pathogenicity in P. luminescens is proposed to be regulated by a Ner - like and a HexA - like regulator that repress primary variant specific genes in the stage of the secondary variant [ 17].

Several of these genes are A + T rich ( > 60% compared to 48% for the Salmonella chromosome) and located within sequences that are not present in close relatives of Salmonella suggesting that they may be unidentified secreted effectors or other virulence determinants that have been acquired from other pathogens.

However this most likely is an underestimate of the true number of proteins that are regulated by Hfq, if accurate protein identifications could be made for the remaining 2829 orfs of the entire Salmonella proteome ( 4450 orfs) that are either expressed at levels too low to be detected or not expressed under the four growth conditions employed in this study.

To solve this problem in the context of mapping the SsrB binding element, we used comparative genomics to search for conserved promoter architecture in another organism with a similar genomic island to Salmonella SPI - 2.

However, other lines of evidence suggested that the recognition site architecture was flexible in nature: ( i) our bacterial one - hybrid screen isolated functional single hexamer sequences, ( ii) the SsrB footprint at the naturally evolved sseA promoter within SPI - 2 [ 26] contained only one reasonably well - conserved heptamer, and ( iii) degenerate or non - ideal palindromes exist in the genome.

Our ChIP - on - chip data further suggested that SsrB binding within SPI - 2 was specific, with binding peaks overlapping precisely with regions of the DNA footprinted by SsrB [ 25], [ 26].

A search of the S. enterica genome for this palindromic motif revealed candidates upstream of the previously noted SsrB dependent genes, including two additional SPI - 2 sites; one IGR site upstream of ssaR that until now had been cryptic, and one intragenic palindrome upstream of sseA in the ssaE CDS.	sseA,282,286,Protein	ssaE,294,298,Protein	"[{""token"": ""sseA"", ""start_span"": 282, ""end_span"": 286, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ssaE"", ""start_span"": 294, ""end_span"": 298, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Thus, in addition to supporting a pathogenic lifestyle within a host in Salmonella, it seems probable that this common promoter architecture may direct the activation of the SSR - 3 T3SS of S. glossinidius in its endosymbiotic relationship with the tsetse fly host, although we acknowledge this requires experimental validation.

The SsrB ortholog in S. glossinidius is approximately30% divergent with SsrB at the protein level, initially leading us to think that they might have different binding site preferences.

With the structure of SsrB available [ 32] and its recognized sequence now identified, future studies will be able to build a picture of how SsrB interacts with both its target DNA, RNA polymerase and potentially other transcription factors including nucleoid associated proteins in order to direct transcription of its regulon.

Using a murine subcutaneous chamber model to sample the bacteria prior to selection or expansion of mutants, we compared gene expression dynamics of wild type ( WT) and previously isolated animal - passaged ( AP) covS mutant bacteria both in vitro and in vivo, and we found extensive transcriptional alterations of pathoadaptive and metabolic gene sets associated with invasion, immune evasion, tissue - dissemination, and metabolic reprogramming.	murine,8,14,Organism	covS,213,217,Protein	"[{""token"": ""murine"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""covS"", ""start_span"": 213, ""end_span"": 217, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Whereas the overall mortality rate of GAS infections is less than 0. 1%, the mortality rate of invasive GAS infections, which have resurged in the past 30 years, mounts to 25% ( out of > 650, 000 new cases per year) [ 1].

Among these features is the ability of M1T1 bacteria to switch to a hypervirulent phenotype associated with invasive diseases in vivo [ 11], [ 12], [ 13], [ 14], a phenomenon that is not fully understood and whose specificity to the M1 serotype remains to be established [ 15].

One of the most striking outcomes of these mutations is the constitutive repression of a gene encoding the key GAS cysteine protease, SpeB, which remodels the host - pathogen interface [ 29] by differentially degrading bacterial surface and secreted proteins [ 12], [ 30], [ 31] as well as host proteins [ 32], [ 33], [ 34].

Additionally, the effects of covS mutations on bacterial niche adaptability are still undetermined because the in vivo transcriptomes of the wild type ( WT) and animal - passaged ( AP) bacteria have not been compared under the same experimental conditions.	covS,29,33,Protein	AP,181,183,Organism	"[{""token"": ""covS"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 181, ""end_span"": 183, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
This difference in buoyancy can be attributed to differences in proteolytic activity ( WT > > AP) that may degrade many surface proteins, including pilin, or induce changes in the surface charge making bacterial aggregates more compact.

In this study, we designed and performed in vivo passage experiments in which equal loads of in vitro - grown WT and AP bacteria were separately inoculated into murine subcutaneous chambers [ 16] and collected by needle aspiration after 24 h, a time sufficient for the bacteria to sense the host environment and transcriptionally respond to it, but not long enough to allow detectable restructuring of the bacterial community and selection of mutants.

Of interest, among the genes of known function, 25% of those whose transcription was modulated as a consequence of the covS mutation are virulence - related and another 25% are related to carbohydrate metabolism pathways, which are connected to virulence in streptococci [ 44], [ 45], [ 46].	covS,119,123,Protein	streptococci,258,270,Organism	"[{""token"": ""covS"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""streptococci"", ""start_span"": 258, ""end_span"": 270, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test

Most genes within the Trx locus are downregulated in AP GAS relative to WT, but upregulated in the WT bacteria in vivo ( Fig. 2, CC6 and Fig. 3) suggesting the possibility of CovS - dependent in vivo signaling.

( 2) The covS mutation in AP bacteria seems to be preferentially modulating virulence mechanisms, as about 25% of the known genes perturbed by the mutation belong to virulence subsystems ( Fig. 5) and many of the other perturbed genes are indirectly associated with virulence ( e. g., carbohydrate metabolism [ 66] and arginine utilization proteins [ 38]).	covS,9,13,Protein	AP,26,28,Organism	"[{""token"": ""covS"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test

In addition, some regions of CbpA protein has the certain similarity with beta - antigen.

The goal of the present study was to investigate the function of S. agalactiae Sak188 / Sak189 TCS.

For the purpose of insertional inactivation, the vector pVA891 - 2 that provides erythromycin ( Em) resistance was used.	erythromycin,81,93,Chemical	Em,96,98,Chemical	"[{""token"": ""erythromycin"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""Em"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"	test
Briefly, DNA fragments of sak188 and sak189 genes were PCR amplified using pairs of primers hkFor, hkRev, and rrFor, rrRev ( Table 1), respectively.	sak188,26,32,Protein	sak189,37,43,Protein	"[{""token"": ""sak188"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak189"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
On the other hand, the bac gene transcription level in sak188 mutant strain was almost similar to that in the wild - type strain that confirmed the results of SDS - PAGE and western - blotting.	bac,23,26,Protein	sak188,55,61,Protein	"[{""token"": ""bac"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak188"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Thus, these data demonstrate that Sak189 protein regulates expression of beta - antigen at transcriptional level.	Sak189,34,40,Protein	beta - antigen,73,87,Protein	"[{""token"": ""Sak189"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""beta - antigen"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Finally, insertional inactivation of sak189 gene, but not sak188 gene, significantly affects virulent properties of S. agalactiae.	sak189,37,43,Protein	sak188,58,64,Protein	"[{""token"": ""sak189"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak188"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
In some strains, the mutations in bac gene resulted in expression of truncated non - functional forms of beta - antigen [ 39], [ 40].	bac,34,37,Protein	beta - antigen,105,119,Protein	"[{""token"": ""bac"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""beta - antigen"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
In present study, the sak188 and sak189 genes of S. agalactiae were inactivated.	sak188,22,28,Protein	sak189,33,39,Protein	"[{""token"": ""sak188"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak189"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Given that insertional inactivation does not delete the entire gene from the chromosome and often results in truncated or modified protein, we analyzed which functional activities of Sak188 and Sak189 proteins could potentially retain if the modified proteins expressed.	Sak188,183,189,Protein	Sak189,194,200,Protein	"[{""token"": ""Sak188"", ""start_span"": 183, ""end_span"": 189, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Sak189"", ""start_span"": 194, ""end_span"": 200, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Thus, we can not rule out the possibility of a cross - talk between Sak189 response regulator and sensor kinase ( s) in S. agalactiae, and Sak189 can potentially recruit another histidine kinase for proper functioning.	Sak189,68,74,Protein	Sak189,139,145,Protein	"[{""token"": ""Sak189"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Sak189"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Intraperitoneal infection of laboratory mice demonstrated that Sak189 DNA - binding response regulatory protein is important for virulent properties of S. agalactiae.	mice,40,44,Organism	Sak189,63,69,Protein	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Sak189"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
In the present study, insertional inactivation of sak189 gene abrogated beta - antigen expression but resulted in increased virulence ( Fig. 4).	sak189,50,56,Protein	beta - antigen,72,86,Protein	"[{""token"": ""sak189"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""beta - antigen"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Thus, we suggest that beta - antigen located on the bacterial surface can interfere with the disease process and play a role of anti - virulent factor ( at least, in mice) similarly to hyaluronate lyase of S. pyogenes [ 41].	beta - antigen,22,36,Protein	mice,166,170,Organism	"[{""token"": ""beta - antigen"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 166, ""end_span"": 170, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
The difference among the growth curves of the wild - type and mutant strains ( data not shown) indicate that in addition to bac gene, some metabolic genes can be controlled by Sak188 / Sak189 TCS.	Sak188,176,182,Protein	Sak189,185,191,Protein	"[{""token"": ""Sak188"", ""start_span"": 176, ""end_span"": 182, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Sak189"", ""start_span"": 185, ""end_span"": 191, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
This suggestion is confirmed by the numerous studies demonstrating the genome - wide location of the genes affected by TCSs [ 10], [ 42], [ 43], and set of the genes controlled by Sak188 / Sak189 ( TCS regulon) can be identified using microarray technology.

As seen from the data of this study, transcription of bac gene and expression of encoded beta - antigen are the primary genotypic / phenotypic properties controlled by Sak188 / Sak189 TCS.

In conclusion, the data presented here characterize the functional role of S. agalactiae Sak188 / Sak189 two - component system.

Both transcription of bac gene and expression of encoded beta - antigen are controlled by Sak189 response regulator, and the regulation occurs at transcriptional level.	beta - antigen,57,71,Protein	Sak189,90,96,Protein	"[{""token"": ""beta - antigen"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Sak189"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
