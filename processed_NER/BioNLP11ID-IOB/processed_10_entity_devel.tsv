In contrast, promoter activity for sseA, ssaB, and sifA decreased in the rpoE mutant compared to wild type cells ( Figure 2A, B and 2D), whereas promoter activity from the ssaG and srfN reporters was upregulated in the rpoE mutant ( Figure 2C and 2F). beta - galactosidase activity observed from the sseL reporter was unaltered in the rpoE deletion compared to that in wild type cells ( Figure 2E).
