Besides mild acid pH, two other stimuli are known to promote expression of PmrA - activated genes: ( i) submillimolar levels of extracellular Fe3 + or Al3 +, which are directly sensed by the PmrB protein ( Wosten et al., 2000), and ( ii) low concentrations of extracellular Mg2 + ( Soncini and Groisman, 1996) ( Fig. 1).

This medium lacked Fe3 + or Al3 +, the only known PmrB ligands ( Wosten et al., 2000), and contained 10 mM MgCl2, which represses expression of PmrA - activated genes ( Soncini and Groisman, 1996; Kox et al., 2000).

Expression of pbgP was still induced when Salmonella was grown in the Chelex - treated medium ( Fig. 2D) or in media containing the specific Fe3 + chelator deferoxamine mesylate ( data not shown) supporting the notion that mild acid pH is responsible for the observed induction.	"pbgP	14	18	Protein"	"Salmonella	42	52	Organism"	"Chelex	70	76	Chemical"	"Fe3 +	141	146	Chemical"	"deferoxamine mesylate	156	177	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""pbgP"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Chelex"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""Fe3 +"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""deferoxamine mesylate"", ""start_span"": 156, ""end_span"": 177, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
We investigated whether PmrB was also required for the pH - dependent induction of pbgP, which was chosen as a prototypical PmrA - activated gene because the PmrA protein binds to the pbgP promoter in vitro ( Wosten and Groisman, 1999) and in vivo ( Shin and Groisman, 2005).	"PmrB	24	28	Protein"	"pbgP	83	87	Protein"	"PmrA	124	128	Protein"	"PmrA	158	162	Protein"	"pbgP	184	188	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pbgP"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 158, ""end_span"": 162, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pbgP"", ""start_span"": 184, ""end_span"": 188, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, we determined the beta - galactosidase activity of isogenic pmrB strains harbouring a chromosomal pbgP - lac transcriptional fusion: expression was approximately sixfold lower in a pmrB mutant than in the pmrB + strain following growth at pH 5. 8 ( Fig. 3), indicating that a functional pmrB gene is necessary for a normal response to mild acid pH.	"pmrB	66	70	Protein"	"pbgP	104	108	Protein"	"pmrB	187	191	Protein"	"pmrB	211	215	Protein"	"pmrB	293	297	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""pmrB"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pbgP"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pmrB"", ""start_span"": 187, ""end_span"": 191, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pmrB"", ""start_span"": 211, ""end_span"": 215, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pmrB"", ""start_span"": 293, ""end_span"": 297, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Consistent with this notion, pbgP transcription was abrogated in the pmrB mutant upon deletion of the pta and ackA genes ( Fig. 3), which encode the two enzymes that are required for the production of acetyl phosphate ( Wolfe, 2005) ( Fig. 1).	"pbgP	29	33	Protein"	"pmrB	69	73	Protein"	"pta	102	105	Protein"	"ackA	110	114	Protein"	"acetyl phosphate	201	217	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""pbgP"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pmrB"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pta"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ackA"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""acetyl phosphate"", ""start_span"": 201, ""end_span"": 217, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
In contrast, a strain lacking the ability to synthesize acetyl phosphate but with a functional pmrB gene exhibited wild - type pbgP expression levels ( Fig. 3), implying that under normal conditions ( i. e. when a functional pmrB gene is present) acetyl phosphate does not contribute to PmrA phosphorylation.	"acetyl phosphate	56	72	Chemical"	"pmrB	95	99	Protein"	"pbgP	127	131	Protein"	"pmrB	225	229	Protein"	"PmrA	287	291	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""acetyl phosphate"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""pmrB"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pbgP"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pmrB"", ""start_span"": 225, ""end_span"": 229, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 287, ""end_span"": 291, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This could be because PmrB is directly involved in sensing extracytoplasmic pH in a way analogous to its sensing of Fe3 + and Al3 + ( Wosten et al., 2000), or because PmrB plays an indirect role in its capacity of main ( if not sole) phosphodonor for PmrA.	"PmrB	22	26	Protein"	"Fe3 +	116	121	Chemical"	"Al3 +	126	131	Chemical"	"PmrB	167	171	Protein"	"PmrA	251	255	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Fe3 +"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""Al3 +"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 167, ""end_span"": 171, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 251, ""end_span"": 255, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To examine this hypothesis, we tested a Salmonella strain with a chromosomal pbgP - lac fusion, deleted for the chromosomal copy of the pmrB gene and harbouring a plasmid expressing a PmrB protein lacking its periplasmic domain for its ability to promote pbgP expression in response to different signals.	"Salmonella	40	50	Organism"	"pbgP	77	81	Protein"	"pmrB	136	140	Protein"	"PmrB	184	188	Protein"	"pbgP	255	259	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""pbgP"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pmrB"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 184, ""end_span"": 188, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pbgP"", ""start_span"": 255, ""end_span"": 259, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Strains expressing the mutant PmrB proteins could express pbgP normally in response to the low Mg2 + signal ( Fig. 6C) ( Wosten et al., 2000), indicating that mutations in residues of the periplasmic domain of PmrB do not impair the enzymatic activity of the cytoplasmic domain of the PmrB protein.

A Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium mlc mutant showed reduced levels of invasion and cytotoxicity compared to the wild - type, and exhibited reduced expression levels of hilD, hilA and invF, which are regulatory genes in the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI1).

The specific down - regulation of hilD observed in the presence of Mlc regulon - inducible sugars, such as glucose and mannose, could not be detected in the mlc mutant.

HilA plays a crucial role in the expression of genes that encode the SPI1 - T3SS apparatus, the prg and inv / spa operons, by binding upstream of prgH and invF ( 10).

Using two - hybrid analysis, it has been shown that HilE interacts with HilD, which suggests that HilE represses hilA expression by inhibiting the activity of HilD through a protein - protein interaction ( 19, 20).	"HilE	52	56	Protein"	"HilD	72	76	Protein"	"HilE	98	102	Protein"	"hilA	113	117	Protein"	"HilD	159	163	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""HilE"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""HilD"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""HilE"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilA"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""HilD"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 163, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The expression levels of hilA, invF and hilD, but not of hilC, are decreased in the mlc mutant	"hilA	25	29	Protein"	"invF	31	35	Protein"	"hilD	40	44	Protein"	"hilC	57	61	Protein"	"mlc	84	87	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""hilA"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""invF"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilD"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilC"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mlc"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We also observed reduced expression of the prgH and sigD genes, which are known to be regulated by HilA and InvF ( 10, 11, 29, 35), in SR1304 ( Figure 2B).

To study the effect of Mlc on hilE expression, we measured the expression of hilE - lacZY on the low - copy plasmid pMAB69, which contains the hilE promoter region from - 886 to + 121, relative to the translation start site.

However, the hilE / mlc double mutant showed an almost similar invasion ability to that of the hilE mutant ( Figure 3B), which suggests that the effect of the mlc mutation on the invasive phenotype is mainly dependent upon HilE function.	"hilE	13	17	Protein"	"mlc	20	23	Protein"	"hilE	95	99	Protein"	"mlc	159	162	Protein"	"HilE	223	227	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""hilE"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mlc"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilE"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mlc"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 162, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""HilE"", ""start_span"": 223, ""end_span"": 227, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
While hilD expression was reduced in the mlc mutant, it was slightly higher than the wild - type level in both the hilE and hilE / mlc mutant strains ( Figure 3C).	"hilD	6	10	Protein"	"mlc	41	44	Protein"	"hilE	115	119	Protein"	"hilE	124	128	Protein"	"mlc	131	134	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""hilD"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mlc"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilE"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilE"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mlc"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The low level of hilD expression in the mlc mutant can be explained by the fact that the increased level of HilE in the mlc mutant can repress the activity of HilD, which is known to act as an activator of its own expression ( 9, 36).	"hilD	17	21	Protein"	"mlc	40	43	Protein"	"HilE	108	112	Protein"	"mlc	120	123	Protein"	"HilD	159	163	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""hilD"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mlc"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""HilE"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mlc"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""HilD"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 163, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In the wild - type strain, glucose and mannose increased hilE expression 2 - fold and hilE activation reduced hilD expression ( Figure 6).	"glucose	27	34	Chemical"	"mannose	39	46	Chemical"	"hilE	57	61	Protein"	"hilE	86	90	Protein"	"hilD	110	114	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""mannose"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""hilE"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilE"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilD"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The 2 - 3 - fold decrease in hilD expression caused by the mlc mutation is sufficient to account for the nearly 10 - fold decrease in hilA and invFA transcription, owing to the nature of the feed - forward regulatory loop, in that moderate effects on HilD production are amplified ( 9).	"hilD	29	33	Protein"	"mlc	59	62	Protein"	"hilA	134	138	Protein"	"invFA	143	148	Protein"	"HilD	251	255	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""hilD"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mlc"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilA"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""invFA"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""HilD"", ""start_span"": 251, ""end_span"": 255, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The two Mlc - binding sites in hilE P3 identified by the gel mobility shift assay and DNase I footprinting analysis show high - level homology with the known consensus Mlc - binding sequences; additionally, the two Mlc - binding sites are separated by 98nt, as is the case for other promoters that have two Mlc - binding sites ( 41).

Glucose and mannose induce the Mlc regulon ( 39) by dephosphorylating EIICBGlc, which then sequesters Mlc from its binding sites ( 27, 43).

We observed a 2 - fold activation of hilE and concomitant repression of hilD in the presence of glucose or mannose, which are known inducers of the Mlc regulon, when TB was used ( Figure 6).	"hilE	37	41	Protein"	"hilD	72	76	Protein"	"glucose	96	103	Chemical"	"mannose	107	114	Chemical"	"Mlc	148	151	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""hilE"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilD"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""mannose"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""Mlc"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The PhoR sensor kinase phosphorylates PhoB when extracellular Pi levels are low, and the phosphorylated PhoB then binds and activates the promoters in the Pho regulon.

Thus, carbon metabolism sensed by PhoB / R may also affect hilE expression ( 22), and this may be one of the reasons for the elevated hilE expression in the presence of carbohydrates in the mlc mutant ( Figure 6A).

The repressive effect of glucose was also observed for the downstream members of the SirA regulon, such as csrB, csrC and hilA ( 48, 49).

To shed light on the mystery of high virulence of the epidemic outbreak strains of SS2, our joint research group completed a comprehensive study of comparative genomics, decoding the whole genome sequences of two virulent SS2 strains ( 98HAH12 and 05ZYH33) isolated from Chinese infected patients [ 6].

These genes include the total 26 ones that are down - regulated in the DeltasalKR mutant, four virulence factors ( CPS, MRP, EF, SLY) coding genes [ 40] - [ 44], genes immediately flanking the salKR locus ( 05SSU0945 and 05SSU0942), and 10 genes that selected from the chromosome of 05ZYH33 every 200 ORFs.

SsrB regulates the expression of SPI - 2 encoded substrate effectors including ssaB, as well as several integrated virulence effectors such as sseL [ 8] and srfN [ 9] that are encoded elsewhere on the chromosome but that have integrated into the SsrB regulon.

Consistent with the results for SseB, there was a decrease in SifA - 2HA levels in DeltarpoE compared to wild type, although deletion of rpoE did not have an effect on SseL - 2HA.

Although there is no evidence that sigmaE can directly repress transcription, the negative effect on two promoters observed here might be due to an intermediate RpoE - regulated repressor or compensatory effect where loss of rpoE increases the relative abundance of another sigma factor that can directly activate the ssaG and srfN promoters.

In addition to TB4953s ( motB, p < 0. 0001) and TB0173s ( cheB2, p < 0. 001), that presented strongly reduced adherence, five other clones were significantly affected in their adherence to cells when compared to the parental TB isolate ( Figure S1 and Table 1).

To ensure that the cheB2 gene in the TB strain is located in a cluster similar to the che2 cluster described for the PAO1 or PA14 strains, we further analyzed the corresponding TB chromosomal region.

The cheB2 mutant ( TB0173s) showed a significantly attenuated virulence during respiratory tract infection of mice as compared to the parental strain TB and the complemented strain TB0173sp2B2.
