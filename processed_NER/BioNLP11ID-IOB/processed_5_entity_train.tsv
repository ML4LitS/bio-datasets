The upregulated spy0127 - 0130 cluster is part of a larger genomic region known as FCT ( for fibronectin - and collagen - binding proteins and T antigen - encoding loci), which spans spy0123 - 0136 in the SF370 genome and encodes surface proteins and transcriptional regulators [ 46].

We created a spy0129 deletion mutant in strain SF370 ( SF370Deltaspy0129) to determine if genes contained within the spy0127 - 0130 cluster were directly involved in adherence to pharyngeal cells.

Unlike the regulatory mechanism of FimA by FimR, this regulation of the mfa1 gene is accomplished by FimR directly binding to the promoter region of mfa1.

FimR, a response regulator of the fimS / fimR two - component system was identified, and FimA expression was found to be dramatically reduced in fimR mutants ( Hayashi et al., 2000).	"FimR	0	4	Protein"	"fimS	34	38	Protein"	"fimR	41	45	Protein"	"FimA	89	93	Protein"	"fimR	145	149	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FimR"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fimS"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fimR"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FimA"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fimR"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Evidence is provided that unlike FimR - dependent fimA expression, FimR regulates mfa1 expression by directly binding to the promoter region of mfa1.

Role of FimR in mfa1 expression The fimA gene is the only gene known to be tightly controlled by the FimS / FimR system.	"FimR	8	12	Protein"	"mfa1	16	20	Protein"	"fimA	36	40	Protein"	"FimS	101	105	Protein"	"FimR	108	112	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FimR"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mfa1"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fimA"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FimS"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FimR"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
FimA protein was not detectable in the fimR - mutant, while a 50% lower level of Mfa1 protein was found in the fimR - mutant compared with that in wild - type strain 33277.	"FimA	0	4	Protein"	"fimR	39	43	Protein"	"Mfa1	81	85	Protein"	"fimR	111	115	Protein"	"33277	166	171	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""FimA"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fimR"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Mfa1"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fimR"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""33277"", ""start_span"": 166, ""end_span"": 171, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
It was postulated that different mechanisms might be involved in FimR - mediated mfa1 expression, since expression regulation of mfa1 by FimR was not controlled as tightly as observed for fimA expression.	"FimR	65	69	Protein"	"mfa1	81	85	Protein"	"mfa1	129	133	Protein"	"FimR	137	141	Protein"	"fimA	188	192	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FimR"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mfa1"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mfa1"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FimR"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fimA"", ""start_span"": 188, ""end_span"": 192, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
A comparison of the transcriptional level of the mfa1 in P. gingivalis wild - type strain and in the fimR mutant indicates that the FimS / FimR system is a positive regulator for the mfa1 gene, although the system controls two fimbrial genes at different levels.	"mfa1	49	53	Protein"	"fimR	101	105	Protein"	"FimS	132	136	Protein"	"FimR	139	143	Protein"	"mfa1	183	187	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""mfa1"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fimR"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FimS"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FimR"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mfa1"", ""start_span"": 183, ""end_span"": 187, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This strategy led us to identify and characterize a point mutation in the phoP / phoR two - component regulatory system of H37Ra that has uncovered novel regulatory links, which impact on the secretion and T cell recognition of the major T cell antigens ESAT - 6 and CFP - 10.	"phoP	74	78	Protein"	"phoR	81	85	Protein"	"H37Ra	123	128	Organism"	"ESAT - 6	254	262	Protein"	"CFP - 10	267	275	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""phoR"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 254, ""end_span"": 262, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CFP - 10"", ""start_span"": 267, ""end_span"": 275, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
While writing this article, the whole genome sequence of H37Ra became publicly available ( NC _ 009525), and comparison of the SNP data obtained from the H37Ra strain used in our laboratory ( Table S1) with the NC _ 009525 data, showed that some differences existed between the H37Ra strains, a phenomenon which was also previously observed for BCG [ 4] and H37Rv [ 17].	"H37Ra	57	62	Organism"	"H37Ra	154	159	Organism"	"H37Ra	278	283	Organism"	"BCG	345	348	Organism"	"H37Rv	358	363	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 159, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 278, ""end_span"": 283, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""BCG"", ""start_span"": 345, ""end_span"": 348, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""H37Rv"", ""start_span"": 358, ""end_span"": 363, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Based on the known role of phoP in virulence [ 14], the H37Ra strain complemented with I36 ( H37Ra:: phoP) was accorded highest priority for further molecular characterization and functional analyses, whereas the two other recombinants ( H37Ra:: fadE5, H37Ra:: rpsL) served as controls.

In contrast, splenocytes from H37Ra:: phoP inoculated mice showed very strong IFN - gamma production in response to incubation with ESAT - 6 and CFP - 10.

This test is based on the presentation of the immunodominant epitope contained in the first 20 amino acids of ESAT - 6 by H37Ra, recombinant H37Ra, or H37Rv infected bone marrow - derived dendritic cells ( BM - DC) to an ESAT - 6 - specific T cell hybridoma ( NB11), restricted by I - Ab.

However, in comparison to the corresponding MT103 wild - type strain, the SO2 strain showed a strongly reduced ESAT - 6 and CFP - 10 specific T cell response, corresponding to a similar low level as the H37Ra strain ( Figure 3B).	"MT103	44	49	Organism"	"SO2	74	77	Organism"	"ESAT - 6	111	119	Protein"	"CFP - 10	124	132	Protein"	"H37Ra	203	208	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""MT103"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""SO2"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CFP - 10"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 203, ""end_span"": 208, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Thus, in order to determine the reason for the observed failure of H37Ra to induce ESAT - 6 - specific responses, H37Rv and H37Ra strains were tested for their potential to express and secrete ESAT - 6 in vitro.

In previous studies rv3614c, rv3615c, rv3616c ( espA) were independently shown to be essential for proper ESAT - 6 secretion [ 27, 28].

The identification of the amino acid change S219L in the predicted DNA binding region of the C - terminal effector domain of PhoP [ 15, 22] in H37Ra was therefore a particularly exciting finding that has the potential to explain part of the attenuation of the H37Ra strain and to elucidate the PhoP / PhoR associated complex regulatory network in M. tuberculosis.

These transcriptome data corroborate our results obtained by quantitative RT - PCR using probe rv3614c, which showed that gene rv3614c was definitely expressed much lower in H37Ra than in H37Rv and H37Ra:: phoP strains ( Figure 6).

The csrS mutants from clinical severe invasive GAS isolates exhibited high mortality and disseminated infection with paucity of neutrophils, a characteristic pathology seen in human invasive GAS infection, in a mouse model.

However, GAS which lack either SLO or ScpC exhibit much less mortality than the csrS - mutated parent invasive GAS isolate to the infected mice.

Furthermore, an SLO deficient mutant from a STSS isolate NIH230 ( NIH230slo) lost the killing activity for PMN ( Figure 3A), thereby, strongly suggesting that SLO is a key element for PMN killing mediated by invasive GAS.

Contrarily, SLS - deficient mutant from NIH230 strain ( NIH230sagA) killed PMN, as efficiently as did parent strain, indicating that SLS is dispensable for killing of PMN mediated by invasive GAS.

GAS isolates from mice with severe invasive disease had mutations in csrS, raising the notion that CsrR / S function is important in modulating gene expression during infection.

The non - invasive 1566 strain displayed the LD50 value approximately 100 - fold higher than that of the severe invasive NIH230 strain ( Table 1), whereas a csrS deletion ( 1566DeltacsrS) caused an increase in the LD50 value comparable to that of the NIH230 strain.

Previous studies using animal - passaged GAS have shown that mutations in both csrS and csrR gene are important for the invasive phenotype [ 5], [ 6], and mutation frequency of csrS and csrR seems to be the same [ 21].

As examples, SpeB [ 22] and SLS [ 23] have been proposed as an invasive infection - associated factor by its cytotoxic effect, however, speB and sagA expression is not enhanced in any csrS - mutated severe invasive GAS isolate used in this study and others [ 5], [ 24].

Furthermore, SLS hemolytic activity of invasive GAS is significantly decreased as compared with non - invasive strains ( data not shown) and SLS - deletion in invasive GAS did not affect PMN survival at all, excluding the possibility for the role of SLS in PMN necrosis seen in this study.	"SLS	13	16	Protein"	"invasive GAS	39	51	Organism"	"non - invasive strains	96	118	Organism"	"SLS	141	144	Protein"	"SLS	250	253	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SLS"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""invasive GAS"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""non - invasive strains"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""SLS"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SLS"", ""start_span"": 250, ""end_span"": 253, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The expression of DNase as well as the slo and the scpC genes in emm1 - genotype strains was enhanced under the csrS mutation [ 5].

Therefore, the second important observation in the present study is that an essential requirement of csrS mutation for invasive infection is associated with increased expression of ScpC and SLO and in vitro evasion of PMN functions, though we do not exclude the possibility that other CsrS - regulating factors contribute to the escape of invasive GAS from host defense.

HPLC analysis of nucleotides extracted from Rv2623D15E and Rv2623G117A revealed that the mutant proteins are indeed deficient in ATP - binding, exhibiting approximately34% ( p < 0. 001) and approximately29% ( p = 0. 0018) of the amount of ATP bound by wild - type Rv2623, respectively ( Figure 7B).

The distinct effects exhibited by the wild type and the G117A and D15E mutants defective in ATP binding suggests a direct correlation between growth attenuation and ATP binding ( Figure 7B).

To examine whether the effects of overexpression of Rv2623 on M. smegmatis are operative in virulent M. tuberculosis, the growth kinetics of the Erdman strain overexpressing wildtype Rv2623, as well as the Rv2623G117A and the Rv2623D15E mutant proteins, were evaluated in vitro using the BACTEC 9000MB system ( Figure 8B).

More important, rv2623 was also shown to be up - regulated when the tubercle bacillus is internalized by human and mouse macrophages [ 10], [ 38] as well as in the lungs of mice with persistent M. tuberculosis infection [ 11].

Recent transcriptional analysis of Rv2623, while confirming the essentiality of the two 18 bp palindromic DosR - binding motifs that are present in the promoter region of this gene [ 38] for induction of Rv2623 under low oxygen conditions, also demonstrated the presence of additional regulatory elements within the rv2623 5 ' - untranslated region [ 18].

The fact that E. coli - expressed Rv2623 co - purifies with ADP as well as ATP suggests the possibility that this mycobacterial USP, like MJ0577, is capable of ATP hydrolysis.

Furthermore, the novel TCS systems described here appear to be linked via GacS to the multicomponent system RetS / LadS / GacAS / RsmA essential for regulating the switch between the planktonic and the sessile mode of growth.

While fruiting body formation is governed by a cascade of RpoN - dependent transcription factors in starving cells, endospore formation in B. subtilis requires the consecutive activity of multiple sigma factors including Sigma E, F, G, and K.

Since phosphorylation of GacS occurred following 8 hr of surface attached growth ( Table 1) and since RetS directly modulates the phosphorylation state of GacS [ 38], the findings may suggest that RetS only remains functional for a period of 8 hours during initial attachment after which RetS is rendered non - functional.

Identification of an SsrB - regulated secretion chaperone Transcriptional profiling of SsrB - regulated genes in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S.

The direct binding of SsrB to the promoter region upstream of srcA, along with SsrB - regulation of both sseL [ 19], [ 20] and pipB2 [ 32] is indicative of multiple cis - regulatory mutation events that have allowed for functional coordination of the distributed secretion apparatus, chaperone and effector cargos.

Conclusions / Significance All these data corroborate the impact of BvrR / BvrS on cell envelope modulation, confirm that this system controls the carbon and nitrogen metabolism, and suggest a cross - talk among some regulators to adjust the Brucella physiology to the shift expected to occur during the transit from the extracellular to the intracellular niche.

Although it has been showed that the mutants in the BvrR / BvrS system have no obvious defects with regard to the ability to grow on standard media [ 4], our microarray results suggests that the BvrR / BvrS system controls elements directly involved in adjusting the Brucella metabolism to the nutrient shift expected to occur during the transit to the intracellular niche.

The fact that the expression of VjbR, OmpR and ExoR was altered in the bvrR mutant demonstrated for the first time an interaction or cross - talk among these global regulators, all involved in the control of composition and structure of the cell envelope ( OMPs, LPS, chaperones, flagella, em).

The results indicate that SeMac is a cysteine endopeptidase but does not inhibit opsonophagocytosis of S. equi by horse PMNs, suggesting that SeMac has function other than evading horse acquired immunity against S. equi infection.

The protein shares 62. 4% identity in amino acid sequence with Mac made by serotype M1 GAS and a putative secretion signal sequence ( amino acids 1 - 34), and the catalytic residues of GAS Mac consisting of Cys94, His262 and Asp284 are conserved in SeMac ( Cys102, His272 and Asp 294) ( Fig. 1).

In this study we describe that SeMac is a cysteine endopeptidase with limited activity against horse IgG and is unable to inhibit opsonophagocytosis of S. equi by horse PMNs in a whole blood assay.
