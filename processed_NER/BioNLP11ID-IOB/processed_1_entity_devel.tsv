Growth in mild acid ( pH 5. 8) promotes transcription of genes activated by the response regulator PmrA, but the signalling pathway ( s) that mediates this response has thus far remained unexplored.

During infection of a mammalian host, Salmonella is exposed to severe acidity in the stomach ( Rychlik and Barrow, 2005) and mild acidification in the endocytic vacuoles of intestinal epithelia and macrophages ( Brumell and Grinstein, 2004).	"Salmonella	38	48	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Moreover, Salmonella has been recovered from soil and water ( Winfield and Groisman, 2003) where the pH can be significantly low.	"Salmonella	10	20	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Previous studies have revealed that Salmonella responds to acidic challenges through an adaptive system called the acid tolerance response in which adaptation to mild acid conditions enables the organism to survive periods of severe acid stress ( Foster and Hall, 1990; Foster, 1995).	"Salmonella	36	46	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The expression of these genes has been shown to be dispensable for the acid tolerance response ( Bearson et al., 1998) which suggests that there are still uncharacterized cellular function ( s) that Salmonella needs to regulate in acidic environments.

We examined transcription of the pmrD gene using RNA isolated from organisms grown at pH 5. 8 or 7. 7.	"pmrD	33	37	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""pmrD"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Growth at pH 5. 8 resulted in pmrD transcript levels that were approximately3. 5 - fold higher than in organisms grown at pH 7. 7 ( Fig. 4A).	"pmrD	30	34	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""pmrD"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Conserved histidine and glutamic acid residues in the periplasmic domain of PmrB are required for signalling in response to mild acid pH	"PmrB	76	80	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, we reasoned that if PmrB senses extracytoplasmic pH directly, its periplasmic domain ( Fig. 5A) was likely to be required for the response to this signal.	"PmrB	26	30	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
An alignment of the amino acid sequences corresponding to the putative periplasmic domain of the PmrB proteins from six enteric species revealed that nine residues are highly conserved ( Fig. 6A).	"PmrB	97	101	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Because the pKa of free histidine is approximately6, the pH at which PmrA - activated genes are induced, we hypothesized that this residue might be required for pH sensing.	"PmrA	69	73	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To test this hypothesis, we constructed a plasmid that produced a PmrB protein containing a single histidine to alanine substitution at position 35.	"PmrB	66	70	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Four of the nine conserved amino acids in the periplasmic domain of PmrB are glutamic acid residues, which also could be subjected to changes in protonation upon variations in the pH of their surroundings.	"PmrB	68	72	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Although the pKa of free glutamic acid is approximately4, which is well below the range of pH at which PmrA - activated genes are induced, the folding of a protein can dramatically change the pKa of its residues.	"PmrA	103	107	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
For instance, the pKa of one of the glutamic acid residues of the regulatory protein TraM is approximately7. 7 ( Lu et al., 2006).	"TraM	85	89	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TraM"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To test this hypothesis, we used plasmids that produced PmrB proteins containing single - amino - acid replacements in the conserved glutamic acid residues.	"PmrB	56	60	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
When either one of the four conserved glutamates was substituted by alanine Salmonella could no longer respond to mild acid pH ( Fig. 6B).	"Salmonella	76	86	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

In fact, the survival of wild - type cells to a challenge with polymyxin B was 100 000 - fold higher when they were grown at pH 5. 8 than when grown at pH 7. 7 ( Fig. 7).	"polymyxin B	63	74	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""polymyxin B"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
The periplasmic histidine and glutamates are conserved in the PmrB periplasmic domain of other enteric species, raising the possibility that the signalling pathway described in this article may be operating in other organisms in addition to S. enterica.

( 1981) determined that the intracellular pH in Escherichia coli cells was 7. 4 even when the external pH was 5. 5.	"Escherichia coli	48	64	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Escherichia coli"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
For example, the eukaryotic G - protein coupled receptor OGR1 is inactive at pH 7. 8 and fully active at pH 6. 8 suggesting that the pH sensing mechanism involves protonation of several extracytoplasmic histidines ( Ludwig et al., 2003), which is in agreement with the pKa of free histidine of approximately6.	"OGR1	57	61	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""OGR1"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In the case of PmrB, a normal response to mild acid pH requires not only a periplasmic histidine but also several glutamic acid residues.	"PmrB	15	19	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, regulation of PmrB activity may involve protonation of one or more of these amino acids.	"PmrB	25	29	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Indeed, the pKa of one of the glutamic acid residues of the regulatory protein TraM is approximately7. 7 in the folded protein ( Lu et al., 2006).	"TraM	79	83	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TraM"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, it is plausible that protonation / deprotonation of one or more of the glutamic acids in the periplasmic domain of PmrB could occur at pH approximately5. 8.	"PmrB	126	130	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PmrB"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
