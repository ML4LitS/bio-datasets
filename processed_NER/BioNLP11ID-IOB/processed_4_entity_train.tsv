To determine if SpeH plays a direct role in the adherence process, we created a deletion mutant in strain SF370 ( SF370DeltaspeH), which was confirmed by PCR ( unpublished data) and RT - PCR ( Figure 1A) and tested in vitro for adherence to human pharyngeal cells.

Only two clusters ( spy0127 - 0130 and spy1701 - 1704) could have been identified without neighbor clustering; however, a number of these genes were initially annotated as hypothetical proteins, so a potential relationship between the gene members may not have been readily apparent.

Recently, it was reported that the four genes spanning spy0127 - 0130 encode, and are responsible for, the formation of surface - localized, trypsin - resistant pili that induce protective immunity against a lethal dose of group A streptococci in a mouse model of infection [ 36].

We posited that a deletion in the spy0129 sortase gene may have the greatest overall effect on the production and processing of the gene products of this cluster, since both the spy0128 and spy0130 gene products do not localize to the cell - wall surface in the absence of the sortase enzyme [ 36].

In agreement with a previous report ( Nishikawa et al., 2004), rFimR did not bind to the fimA promoter region, suggesting that regulation of fimA expression by FimR is through a different mechanism.	"rFimR	63	68	Protein"	"fimA	89	93	Protein"	"fimA	141	145	Protein"	"FimR	160	164	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""rFimR"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fimA"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fimA"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FimR"", ""start_span"": 160, ""end_span"": 164, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The previous study suggested that regulation of fimA expression by FimR is through a regulation cascade involving interaction of FimR and the promoter region of the first gene in the fimA cluster ( Nishikawa et al., 2004).	"fimA	48	52	Protein"	"FimR	67	71	Protein"	"FimR	129	133	Protein"	"fimA	183	187	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""fimA"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FimR"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FimR"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fimA"", ""start_span"": 183, ""end_span"": 187, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Here it is demonstrated that FimR binds directly to the promoter region of the mfa1 gene, suggesting a direct role of FimR in activation of mfa1 expression.	"FimR	29	33	Protein"	"mfa1	79	83	Protein"	"FimR	118	122	Protein"	"mfa1	140	144	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FimR"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mfa1"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FimR"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mfa1"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Moreover, FimR appears to act on the promoter region identified here, suggesting that this promoter may make significant contributions toward mfa1 expression through the FimS / FimR system.

Expression of major fimbriae ( FimA) is extremely low in the fimR mutant, and minor fimbriae production in this mutant is inhibited by least 50%.

Two of the most widely used attenuated strains in the history of tuberculosis research are Mycobacterium bovis BCG ( BCG) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra ( H37Ra), which both lost their virulence during in vitro serial passage.	"Mycobacterium bovis BCG	91	114	Organism"	"BCG	117	120	Organism"	"Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra	126	158	Organism"	"H37Ra	161	166	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Mycobacterium bovis BCG"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""BCG"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 161, ""end_span"": 166, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Whereas the attenuation of BCG is due mainly to loss of the ESAT - 6 secretion system, ESX - 1, the reason why H37Ra is attenuated remained unknown.	"BCG	27	30	Organism"	"ESAT - 6	60	68	Protein"	"ESX - 1	87	94	Protein"	"H37Ra	111	116	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""BCG"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ESX - 1"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
"Only H37Ra "" knock - ins "" that carried an integrated cosmid with the wild - type phoP gene from M. tuberculosis H37Rv showed changes in colony morphology, increased virulence, ESAT - 6 secretion, and induction of specific T cell responses, whereas other H37Ra constructs did not."

It is clearly visible that at nucleotide position 656 of phoP two peaks exist, one originating from the SNP present in H37Ra and one from the integrated cosmid I36 carrying the H37Rv wild - type copy of phoP.

Complementation of H37Ra with the PhoP - expressing cosmid increased the virulence of the H37Ra:: phoP recombinant relative to H37Ra, resulting in a 1. 0 log and 0. 5 log increase in CFU number in lungs and spleens, respectively.

Firstly, we constructed a partially diploid H37Ra knock - in strain carrying cosmid RD1 - ppe68 - ko that, in BCG yields the greatest amounts of ESAT - 6 expression and secretion [ 24].	"H37Ra	44	49	Organism"	"ppe68	90	95	Protein"	"BCG	110	113	Organism"	"ESAT - 6	145	153	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""ppe68"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""BCG"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, in H37Ra the presence of this cosmid could not increase the weak ESAT - 6 and CFP - 10 T cell responses ( Figure 3B) in the splenocyte IFN - gamma assay.

In the bacterial world the PhoP / PhoR like two - component systems are widely distributed and fulfill a large variety of functions including sensing phosphate and magnesium [ 32, 33], or regulating virulence genes [ 34].

It was also found that the PhoP - PhoR system controls the biosynthesis of polyketide - derived lipids [ 35] and determines the amount of triacylated and monoacylated lipoarabinomannans in M. tuberculosis [ 36].

Most interestingly, about two thirds of these 44 genes were also found substantially lower expressed in H37Ra in comparison to H37Rv, when the transcriptional profiles of H37Ra and H37Rv cultures grown in various media were examined [ 12].	"H37Ra	104	109	Organism"	"H37Rv	127	132	Organism"	"H37Ra	171	176	Organism"	"H37Rv	181	186	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""H37Rv"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 171, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""H37Rv"", ""start_span"": 181, ""end_span"": 186, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, the most striking link in relation to our results on phoP and ESAT - 6 secretion that was revealed by these two transcriptional analyses, were the data on gene cluster rv3612c - rv3616c.	"phoP	62	66	Protein"	"ESAT - 6	71	79	Protein"	"rv3612c	177	184	Protein"	"rv3616c	187	194	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""rv3612c"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 184, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""rv3616c"", ""start_span"": 187, ""end_span"": 194, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Closer inspection of the data published in the corresponding supplemental materials showed that rv3612c - rv3616c were strongly downregulated in the H37Rv phoP ko mutant as well as in H37Ra [ 12, 21].	"rv3612c	96	103	Protein"	"rv3616c	106	113	Protein"	"phoP	155	159	Protein"	"H37Ra	184	189	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""rv3612c"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""rv3616c"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 159, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 184, ""end_span"": 189, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, upregulation of phoP and rv3614c - rv3616c was observed after incubation of M. tuberculosis in 5mM H2O2 [ 37].	"phoP	25	29	Protein"	"rv3614c	34	41	Protein"	"rv3616c	44	51	Protein"	"H2O2	108	112	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""rv3614c"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""rv3616c"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""H2O2"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
It should be mentioned here that the SO2 phoP ko strain, which showed strong ESAT - 6 expression but little ESAT - 6 secretion ( Figure 5), induced only very reduced ESAT - 6 - specific T cell responses ( Figure 3).	"phoP	41	45	Protein"	"ESAT - 6	77	85	Protein"	"ESAT - 6	108	116	Protein"	"ESAT - 6 -	166	176	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""phoP"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ESAT - 6"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ESAT - 6 -"", ""start_span"": 166, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As ESAT - 6 - specific T cell responses induced by this strain are low, ESAT - 6 - based IFN - gamma production assays might be used to differentiate between vaccination with SO2 and infection with wild - type M. tuberculosis.

Finally, it is intriguing that both BCG and H37Ra, the two most often used attenuated tubercle bacilli, are attenuated for reasons linked to loss of ESAT - 6 functions.

To confirm that SLO activity is increased in invasive GAS strain, we measured SLO hemolytic activity of GAS strains used in this study.

Although NIH230slo lost the killing activity for PMN, migration of PMN in response to IL - 8 in a transwell system was not restored in the presence of this mutant ( Figure 4A), thereby, suggesting that severe invasive GAS blocks PMN migration by influence on IL - 8 activity.	"NIH230slo	9	18	Protein"	"IL - 8	86	92	Protein"	"invasive GAS	209	221	Organism"	"IL - 8	259	265	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NIH230slo"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 8"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""invasive GAS"", ""start_span"": 209, ""end_span"": 221, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""IL - 8"", ""start_span"": 259, ""end_span"": 265, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Figure 4B shows that the amount of IL - 8 was significantly reduced by 60 - min co - culture with NIH230, as well as NIH230slo, but not with non - invasive GAS 1556.

Enhanced expression of the slo and the scpC genes in severe invasive GAS is attributed to mutation of a transcriptional regulator CsrS	"slo	27	30	Protein"	"scpC	39	43	Protein"	"invasive GAS	60	72	Organism"	"CsrS	130	134	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""slo"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""scpC"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""invasive GAS"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""CsrS"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, we analyzed the linkage between the csrS and / or csrR genes and the property of invasive GAS infection by sequencing these genes in the emm49 strains used in this study.

In order to clarify the role of CsrS regarding expression of the virulence - associated genes and resistance to PMN killing, we introduced the intact csrS gene of the 1566 strain into the severe invasive GAS ( see Figure 5A).	"CsrS	32	36	Protein"	"csrS	150	154	Protein"	"1566	167	171	Organism"	"invasive GAS	195	207	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""CsrS"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""csrS"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""1566"", ""start_span"": 167, ""end_span"": 171, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""invasive GAS"", ""start_span"": 195, ""end_span"": 207, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The csrS - introduced severe invasive GAS reduced the expression levels of the slo and the scpC genes, comparable to those detected in the non - invasive GAS.	"csrS	4	8	Protein"	"slo	79	82	Protein"	"scpC	91	95	Protein"	"non - invasive GAS	139	157	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""csrS"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""slo"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""scpC"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""non - invasive GAS"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In order to elucidate the role of csrS, in infections in vivo, we compared the virulence of GAS isolates using a mouse model which infected GAS intraperitoneally.	"csrS	34	38	Protein"	"GAS	92	95	Organism"	"mouse	113	118	Organism"	"GAS	140	143	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""csrS"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GAS"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""GAS"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Consistently, an introduction of the intact csrS gene into the NIH230 strain ( NIH230:: csrS +) reduced the LD50 value to the level observed in the non - invasive strain.	"csrS	44	48	Protein"	"NIH230	63	69	Organism"	"csrS +	88	94	Protein"	"non - invasive strain	148	169	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""csrS"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""NIH230"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""csrS +"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""non - invasive strain"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 169, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Subcutaneous inoculation of NIH230scpC and NIH230slo yielded the local infected lesions with area comparable to those of 1566 and NIH230:: csrS + during the course of infection ( Figure 7D).	"NIH230scpC	28	38	Protein"	"NIH230slo	43	52	Protein"	"1566	121	125	Organism"	"csrS +	139	145	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NIH230scpC"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""NIH230slo"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""1566"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""csrS +"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These results suggest that enhanced expression of ScpC and SLO in invasive GAS plays an important role in vivo virulence of GAS infection.	"ScpC	50	54	Protein"	"SLO	59	62	Protein"	"invasive GAS	66	78	Organism"	"GAS	124	127	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""ScpC"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SLO"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""invasive GAS"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""GAS"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
It have been demonstrated that CsrS / R is a member of the two - component regulatory systems for regulating the multipe virulence factors of GAS, by using genetically - manipulated GAS mutants [ 20].

Introduction of the intact csrS gene into the severe invasive GAS restored the susceptibility to the killing by PMN and abrogated the activity for inhibition of PMN recruitment and survival, thus, demonstrating an instructional role of the loss - of - functional mutations in csrS gene for the evasion of PMN functions, providing unique pathophysiology of invasive GAS infections.	"csrS	27	31	Protein"	"invasive GAS	53	65	Organism"	"csrS	276	280	Protein"	"GAS	365	368	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""csrS"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""invasive GAS"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""csrS"", ""start_span"": 276, ""end_span"": 280, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GAS"", ""start_span"": 365, ""end_span"": 368, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Furthermore, the expression of some human invasive disease - associated genes [ 5] including slo was enhanced in the csrS mutant ( Figure 5B), but not in the csrR mutant [ 20].	"human	36	41	Organism"	"slo	93	96	Protein"	"csrS	117	121	Protein"	"csrR	158	162	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""slo"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""csrS"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""csrR"", ""start_span"": 158, ""end_span"": 162, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
On the contrary of a dogma that CsrS / R is a definitive member of the two - component regulatory systems, which involve a coordinate pair of proteins known as the sensor kinase and the response regulator [ 20], CsrS may transmit a signal not only to CsrR but also to other regulators.

A study has demonstrated SLO from invasive GAS lyse PMN [ 27], however this effect is likely due to complement activation by SLO [ 28] or PMN activation [ 29] but not due to cytotoxity of SLO itself as judged by their flow cytometry profiles which are distinct from ours ( Figure 2A).

In the present study, we observed that SLO concentration in a short - time culture with severe invasive GAS did not reach the threshold level to kill PMN by formation of pores ( data not shown) and that PMN did not undergo necrosis upon incubation with culture media of severe invasive GAS ( Figure 3B), leading to the novel possibility that PMN are probably killed following encounter with invasive GAS in a contact - dependent manner.

Sub - inhibitory concentrations of DNA created a cation - limited environment that resulted in induction of the PhoPQ - and PmrAB - regulated cationic antimicrobial peptide resistance operon PA3552 - PA3559 in P. aeruginosa.

In P. aeruginosa, resistance to CAPs is inducible by the PhoPQ and PmrAB TCSs, both of which are activated independently in response to limiting Mg2 + [ 43] - [ 46].

The PhoPQ and PmrAB regulatory systems are well studied in planktonic cultures and have been shown to induce modest resistance to CAPs ( 8 - fold) under low Mg2 + conditions [ 45].

To confirm that DNA - mediated killing was a result of cation chelation, excess Mg2 +, Ca2 +, Mn2 +, and Zn2 + were added to P. aeruginosa cultures.

Kill curve assays indicated that the addition of Mg2 +, Ca2 + or Mn2 + provided protection from DNA - induced lysis, however, the addition of Zn2 + did not protect from DNA - mediated killing ( Fig 3A).

To determine if extracellular DNA imposes Mg2 + limitation, we measured the gene expression of a chromosomally encoded transcriptional lux ( bioluminescence) fusion to PA3553, as a measure of the CAP resistance operon expression in planktonic cultures.

We report here that DNA - induces aminoglycoside resistance in P. aeruginosa biofilms, and this resistance is partially dependent on the LPS modification operon PA3552 - PA3559.

Therefore, it appears that there are multiple environmental signals in the CF lung that can induce the expression the PA3552 - PA3559 operon, which may explain why many P. aeruginosa CF isolates show LPS modifications such as aminoarabinose addition to lipid A [ 78].

As many P. aeruginosa strains isolated from the CF lung overproduce the negatively charged EPS alginate, we hypothesized that alginate may also be a relevant in vivo signal inducing expression of the PA3552 - PA3559 operon.

Salmonella enteriditis serotype Typhimurium ( referred to simply as Salmonella or Typhimurium below) is a paradigm for understanding intracellular pathogenesis because of its established genetics and simple and inexpensive animal model - the mouse.

The use of streptonigrin, an antibiotic whose toxicity correlates with levels of free iron, was based on the observation that the intracellular environment of macrophages can induce a iron - scavenging response in mycobacteria [ 25], perhaps as a means of maintaining adequate levels of this important growth factor, and that an E. coli USP was shown to regulate iron uptake [ 9].

An HPLC - based examination of supernatants from boiled samples of His6 - Rv2623 demonstrated that His6 - Rv2623 co - purifies with both ATP and ADP ( Figure 5).

It is conceivable that the presence of ADP is the consequence of an Rv2623 - associated ATP activity and this putative ATPase function is currently under investigation.

Importantly, thermal denaturation profiles of wild - type Rv2623, Rv2623D15E and Rv2623G117A demonstrated virtually identical Tm values, implying that the native Rv2623 fold was not destabilized by these mutations ( Figure 7C).

RetS is postulated to act in concert with two other TCS sensor kinase - response regulator hybrids, GacS and LadS, to coordinate the expression of determinants involved in biofilm formation and the production of determinants required for cytotoxicity in P. aeruginosa via the small regulatory RNA rsmZ [ 36], [ 37].

Interestingly, PA4102 ( BfmS), the cognate sensor of PA4101, was found to be phosphorylated following PA4101 phosphorylation after 72 hr of biofilm growth ( Table 1).

No evidence of phosphorylation of PA4197, PA4101, or GacS was detected in DeltaPA4197 mutant biofilm phosphorylation patterns.

Since GacS was found to be phosphorylated in a BfiS - dependent manner following 8 hrs of growth, we asked whether a DeltagacS mutant forms biofilms similar in architecture to DeltabfiS biofilms.

The novelty of these TCS is further supported by the finding that a search for BfiS ( PA4197) and BfmR ( PA4101) homologues using BLAST ( http: / / blast. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov / Blast. cgi) and BLINK ( precomputed BLAST, [ 53]), did not reveal any proteins that have been previously characterized in the literature.

While our study did not result in the identification of RetS or LadS, we identified GacS by two different approaches and confirmed GacS phosphorylation by immunoblot analysis ( Table 1).

GacS acts as a suppressor of RetS ( and vice versa) with RetS regulating the suppressor activity of the membrane - bound sensor GacS by directly modulating its phosphorylation state [ 38].

Taken together, our observations suggest a link between the multi - component switch RetS / LadS / GacAS / RsmA which reciprocally regulates virulence and the transition between the planktonic and the surface attached mode of growth and the previously undescribed signaling network which regulates developmental steps once P. aeruginosa has committed to the surface associated lifestyle ( Fig. 6).

Further biochemical and quantitative proteomics data revealed three protein interactions with SrcA, including two effector cargos ( SseL and PipB2) and the type III - associated ATPase, SsaN, that increases the efficiency of effector translocation.

In addition to activating all of the T3SS structural operons, transcriptional profiling has uncovered new genes in the SsrB regulon that are required for bacterial pathogenesis including a translocated effector, SseL [ 19], [ 20], and a gene of unknown function called srfN that is common to the Salmonella genus [ 21].

Using a reverse genetics approach we identified an SsrB - regulated gene ( STM2138) that we named srcA ( SsrB - regulated chaperone A), whose gene product satisfied several a priori predictions relating to the physical properties associated with T3SS chaperones.

The srcA gene is not located in the vicinity of the T3SS encoded by SPI - 2 ( STM1378 - STM1425), but is 713 genes downstream on the chromosome ( STM numbers are based on the LT2 genome and ordered sequentially on the chromosome beginning at STM0001, thrL).

To verify SsrB input on srcA expression, we analyzed SsrB binding in vivo at the region of DNA surrounding srcA using genome - wide ChIP - on - chip [ 21] ( and unpublished data).

To evaluate the potential for an effector - binding surface on SrcA, the structure of SicP in complex with its effector SptP was aligned with SrcA and represented as a space - filling model ( Fig. 3B).

When SrcA was mixed with SsaN, a new protein complex of high molecular weight was observed, along with diminished peaks corresponding to the SrcA dimer and SsaN monomer ( Fig. 4C).

In our experiments, we could induce the ATPase domain of SsaN to oligomerize in the presence of SrcA, but not in its absence, which was intriguing because the purified enzyme lacked a domain at the carboxyl terminus thought to be involved in oligomer stability, at least for E. coli EscN [ 14].

On average, the mice challenged with Y. pestis DeltayitR - infected fleas, both those that developed disease and those that did not, received a higher cumulative number of bites from blocked fleas than the mice challenged with Y. pestis - infected fleas, but this difference was not statistically significant ( Fig. 5).

To characterize SeMac, the fragment of S. equi mac gene encoding mature SeMac was cloned, and recombinant SeMac was purified to > 95% purity as assessed by SDS - PAGE ( Fig. 3A).

To test whether SeMac is produced in vivo during S. equi infection, the presence of SeMac - specific antibody was assessed by Western immunoblot analysis with convalescent sera from 3 horses suffered from strangles and mice with experimental S. equi infection.

The results indicate that SeMac is a cysteine endopeptidase, which uses Cys102, His272 and Asp294 as its catalytic triad to cleave human IgG.

The inability of SeMac to inhibit S. equi opsonophagocytosis by horse PMNs may be due to its inability to cleave the majority of horse IgG.

Thus, like GAS M1 Mac [ 7, 8], SeMac is a cysteine endopeptidase.

The fact that SeMac does not inhibit opsonophagocytosis of S. equi by horse PMNs indicates that SeMac is not involved in the evasion of the acquired horse immunity against S. equi.
