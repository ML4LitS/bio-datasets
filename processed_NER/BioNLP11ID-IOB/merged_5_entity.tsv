Besides mild acid pH, two other stimuli are known to promote expression of PmrA - activated genes: ( i) submillimolar levels of extracellular Fe3 + or Al3 +, which are directly sensed by the PmrB protein ( Wosten et al., 2000), and ( ii) low concentrations of extracellular Mg2 + ( Soncini and Groisman, 1996) ( Fig. 1).

We investigated whether PmrB was also required for the pH - dependent induction of pbgP, which was chosen as a prototypical PmrA - activated gene because the PmrA protein binds to the pbgP promoter in vitro ( Wosten and Groisman, 1999) and in vivo ( Shin and Groisman, 2005).

Thus, we determined the beta - galactosidase activity of isogenic pmrB strains harbouring a chromosomal pbgP - lac transcriptional fusion: expression was approximately sixfold lower in a pmrB mutant than in the pmrB + strain following growth at pH 5. 8 ( Fig. 3), indicating that a functional pmrB gene is necessary for a normal response to mild acid pH.	pmrB,66,70,Protein	pbgP,104,108,Protein	pmrB,187,191,Protein	pmrB,211,215,Protein	pmrB,293,297,Protein	"[{""token"": ""pmrB"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pbgP"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pmrB"", ""start_span"": 187, ""end_span"": 191, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pmrB"", ""start_span"": 211, ""end_span"": 215, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pmrB"", ""start_span"": 293, ""end_span"": 297, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	valid
Consistent with this notion, pbgP transcription was abrogated in the pmrB mutant upon deletion of the pta and ackA genes ( Fig. 3), which encode the two enzymes that are required for the production of acetyl phosphate ( Wolfe, 2005) ( Fig. 1).	pbgP,29,33,Protein	pmrB,69,73,Protein	pta,102,105,Protein	ackA,110,114,Protein	acetyl phosphate,201,217,Chemical	"[{""token"": ""pbgP"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pmrB"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pta"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ackA"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""acetyl phosphate"", ""start_span"": 201, ""end_span"": 217, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"	valid
In contrast, a strain lacking the ability to synthesize acetyl phosphate but with a functional pmrB gene exhibited wild - type pbgP expression levels ( Fig. 3), implying that under normal conditions ( i. e. when a functional pmrB gene is present) acetyl phosphate does not contribute to PmrA phosphorylation.	acetyl phosphate,56,72,Chemical	pmrB,95,99,Protein	pbgP,127,131,Protein	pmrB,225,229,Protein	PmrA,287,291,Protein	"[{""token"": ""acetyl phosphate"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""pmrB"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pbgP"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pmrB"", ""start_span"": 225, ""end_span"": 229, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PmrA"", ""start_span"": 287, ""end_span"": 291, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	valid
This could be because PmrB is directly involved in sensing extracytoplasmic pH in a way analogous to its sensing of Fe3 + and Al3 + ( Wosten et al., 2000), or because PmrB plays an indirect role in its capacity of main ( if not sole) phosphodonor for PmrA.

To examine this hypothesis, we tested a Salmonella strain with a chromosomal pbgP - lac fusion, deleted for the chromosomal copy of the pmrB gene and harbouring a plasmid expressing a PmrB protein lacking its periplasmic domain for its ability to promote pbgP expression in response to different signals.

Strains expressing the mutant PmrB proteins could express pbgP normally in response to the low Mg2 + signal ( Fig. 6C) ( Wosten et al., 2000), indicating that mutations in residues of the periplasmic domain of PmrB do not impair the enzymatic activity of the cytoplasmic domain of the PmrB protein.

However, the hilE / mlc double mutant showed an almost similar invasion ability to that of the hilE mutant ( Figure 3B), which suggests that the effect of the mlc mutation on the invasive phenotype is mainly dependent upon HilE function.	hilE,13,17,Protein	mlc,20,23,Protein	hilE,95,99,Protein	mlc,159,162,Protein	HilE,223,227,Protein	"[{""token"": ""hilE"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mlc"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilE"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mlc"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 162, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""HilE"", ""start_span"": 223, ""end_span"": 227, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	valid

An occurrence of bac gene, sak188, sak189 TCS genes and erythromycin resistance among S. agalactiae strains A total of 239 S. agalactiae strains isolated from human and animals were studied.	bac,17,20,Protein	sak188,27,33,Protein	sak189,35,41,Protein	erythromycin,56,68,Chemical	human,159,164,Organism	"[{""token"": ""bac"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak188"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak189"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""erythromycin"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 164, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
Given that insertional inactivation of RR gene results in inactivation of HK gene [ 22] which are co - transcribed ( Fig. 1), the strain with insertionally inactivated sak189 gene can be considered as sak189 / sak188 double mutant strain, while the strain with insertionally inactivated sak188 gene - as sak188 mutant strain.	sak189,168,174,Protein	sak189,201,207,Protein	sak188,210,216,Protein	sak188,287,293,Protein	sak188,304,310,Protein	"[{""token"": ""sak189"", ""start_span"": 168, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak189"", ""start_span"": 201, ""end_span"": 207, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak188"", ""start_span"": 210, ""end_span"": 216, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak188"", ""start_span"": 287, ""end_span"": 293, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak188"", ""start_span"": 304, ""end_span"": 310, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Comparative analysis of Sak188 and Sak189 amino acid sequences in the wild - type strain 168 / 00 and deduced protein sequences in mutant strains predicted the replacement of 95 amino acids at the C - terminal end of Sak188 protein by 191 amino acids, and replacement of 51 amino acids at the C - terminal end of Sak189 protein by 15 amino acids ( Fig. 5).

Theoretically, in both sak188 mutant strain and sak189 / sak188 double mutant strain, the Sak188 / Sak189 TCS can be inactive.	sak188,23,29,Protein	sak189,48,54,Protein	sak188,57,63,Protein	Sak188,90,96,Protein	Sak189,99,105,Protein	"[{""token"": ""sak188"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak189"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak188"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Sak188"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Sak189"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Thus, we can conclude that sak188 and bac gene are not in the operon, and repression of bac gene transcription in sak189 / sak188 double mutant strain is not due to the polar effect.	sak188,27,33,Protein	bac,38,41,Protein	bac,88,91,Protein	sak189,114,120,Protein	sak188,123,129,Protein	"[{""token"": ""sak188"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""bac"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""bac"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak189"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak188"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
