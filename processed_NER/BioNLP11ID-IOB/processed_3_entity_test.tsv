To study how Drosophila flies deal with infectious diseases in a natural context, we investigated the interactions between Drosophila and a newly identified entomopathogen, Pseudomonas entomophila.	"Drosophila	13	23	Organism"	"Drosophila	123	133	Organism"	"Pseudomonas entomophila	173	196	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Pseudomonas entomophila"", ""start_span"": 173, ""end_span"": 196, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Interestingly, aprA mutants were able to survive to wild - type levels in immune - deficient Relish flies, indicating that the protease plays an important role in protection against the Drosophila immune response.	"aprA	15	19	Protein"	"Relish flies	93	105	Organism"	"Drosophila	186	196	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Relish flies"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 186, ""end_span"": 196, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We have isolated several Erwinia carotovora strains, such as Ecc15, for their capacity to persist in the Drosophila larval gut and to trigger a strong systemic immune response following oral infection [ 8].	"Erwinia carotovora	25	43	Organism"	"Ecc15	61	66	Organism"	"Drosophila	105	115	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Erwinia carotovora"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Ecc15"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Although not a pathogen to Drosophila, use of Ecc15 has been pivotal in revealing the ability of Drosophila to activate an adapted response to persistent microorganisms in the gut, including the induction of local immune responses.	"Drosophila	27	37	Organism"	"Ecc15	46	51	Organism"	"Drosophila	97	107	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Ecc15"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Among them we identified the GacS / GacA two - component regulatory system which, in Pseudomonas fluorescens, has been well characterized and demonstrated to be an essential regulator of virulence [ 11].	"GacS	29	33	Protein"	"GacA	36	40	Protein"	"Pseudomonas fluorescens	85	108	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""GacS"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GacA"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Pseudomonas fluorescens"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
P. entomophila gacA mutants are non - pathogenic and fail to trigger a systemic immune response after ingestion, indicating that the GacS / GacA two - component system regulates important bacterial virulence effectors required to infect and kill flies [ 9].	"gacA	15	19	Protein"	"GacS	133	137	Protein"	"GacA	140	144	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GacS"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GacA"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In P. fluorescens, membrane - localized anti - sigma factor PrtR cleaves the extracytoplasmic sigma factor PrtI, resulting in increased expression of multiple genes, including one encoding for a metalloprotease, aprX [ 16].	"PrtR	60	64	Protein"	"PrtI	107	111	Protein"	"aprX	212	216	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PrtR"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PrtI"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""aprX"", ""start_span"": 212, ""end_span"": 216, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To test a possible role of prtR in the regulation of aprA expression, we analyzed the proteins present in the supernatant of prtR mutants.	"prtR	27	31	Protein"	"aprA	53	57	Protein"	"prtR	125	129	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""prtR"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""prtR"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Measurement of in vitro protease activity with azocasein revealed that the gacA mutant secretes no detectable protease activity and that prtR mutants retain only 30% of wild - type supernatant activity, thus indicating a role for PrtR in the regulation of P. entomophila protease secretion ( Figure 1F).	"gacA	75	79	Protein"	"prtR	137	141	Protein"	"PrtR	230	234	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""prtR"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PrtR"", ""start_span"": 230, ""end_span"": 234, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Whereas this food - uptake cessation was still observed in aprA and prtR mutants, it was not evident in gacA mutant - infected larvae ( Figure 2D and data not shown for prtR).	"aprA	59	63	Protein"	"prtR	68	72	Protein"	"gacA	104	108	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""prtR"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The data presented above clearly indicate that AprA is a major virulence factor of P. entomophila that promotes bacterial persistence and killing of the host, but that other virulence factors controlled by gacA and prtR exist.	"AprA	47	51	Protein"	"gacA	206	210	Protein"	"prtR	215	219	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 206, ""end_span"": 210, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""prtR"", ""start_span"": 215, ""end_span"": 219, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The observation that P. entomophila persistence in flies and larvae is lower in aprA mutants clearly indicates that the AprA protease promotes bacterial persistence in the Drosophila gut.	"aprA	80	84	Protein"	"AprA	120	124	Protein"	"Drosophila	172	182	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 172, ""end_span"": 182, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Whereas the titer of gacA mutants decreased with time, we observed that the aprA derivative persisted at a level similar to wild - type bacteria in Rel - deficient mutant flies and larvae ( Figure 3A and 3B, and unpublished data).	"gacA	21	25	Protein"	"aprA	76	80	Protein"	"Rel	148	151	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Rel"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It is interesting to note that in agreement with the results described above, persistence of both the aprA mutant and wild - type bacteria was significantly altered in fly lines over - expressing the Imd pathway, and that aprA mutants survived less than wild - type bacteria ( Figure 4B).	"aprA	102	106	Protein"	"Imd	200	203	Protein"	"aprA	222	226	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 200, ""end_span"": 203, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 222, ""end_span"": 226, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
P. entomophila, but not the gacA derivative, rapidly activates both the local and systemic Imd - dependent immune responses in Drosophila adults, which can be demonstrated using RT - qPCR with fat body and gut extracts ( Figure 5A).	"gacA	28	32	Protein"	"Imd	91	94	Protein"	"Drosophila	127	137	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Imd"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Thus, we next compared survival of Rel flies specifically expressing a wild - type copy of Rel in the intestine using caudal ( cad) - Gal4.	"Rel	35	38	Protein"	"Rel	91	94	Protein"	"Gal4	134	138	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rel"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Rel"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Gal4"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Figure 5E shows that Rel flies expressing Rel in the gut survive better than Rel mutant flies.	"Rel	21	24	Protein"	"Rel	42	45	Protein"	"Rel	77	80	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rel"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Rel"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Rel"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Alternatively, in Photorhabdus luminescens, an AprA homologue, PrtA, has been proposed not to be a virulence factor, but rather to be involved in degrading host tissues following host death in order to promote efficient nutrition and development of its symbiotic nematode host [ 14, 29].	"Photorhabdus luminescens	18	42	Organism"	"AprA	47	51	Protein"	"PrtA	63	67	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Photorhabdus luminescens"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PrtA"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Many pseudomonads and other bacteria express proteases similar to AprA but are not able to infect Drosophila by oral ingestion.	"pseudomonads	5	17	Organism"	"AprA	66	70	Protein"	"Drosophila	98	108	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""pseudomonads"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""AprA"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The difference in pathogenicity exhibited by gacA, prtR, and aprA mutants underlines the complexity of P. entomophila virulence factors.	"gacA	45	49	Protein"	"prtR	51	55	Protein"	"aprA	61	65	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""prtR"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The observation that both aprA and prtR, but not gacA, mutants retained the capacity to trigger a systemic immune response indicates a clear distinction between pathogenicity and immune activation.	"aprA	26	30	Protein"	"prtR	35	39	Protein"	"gacA	49	53	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""prtR"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Another interesting feature of P. entomophila virulence is the food - uptake cessation which is observed in prtR and aprA but not in gacA mutants.	"prtR	108	112	Protein"	"aprA	117	121	Protein"	"gacA	133	137	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""prtR"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""aprA"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""gacA"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The three remaining motility genes that were not significantly enriched are two chemoreceptor genes, trg and aer, and the filament cap chaperone, fliT.	"trg	101	104	Protein"	"aer	109	112	Protein"	"fliT	146	150	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""trg"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""aer"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""fliT"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In addition, it has been reported that fliT mutations enhance expression of class 2 flagellar operons [ 20] because FliT acts as a negative regulator of these operons by binding to and inhibiting the activity of FlhDC [ 21].	"fliT	39	43	Protein"	"FliT	116	120	Protein"	"FlhDC	212	217	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""fliT"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FliT"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FlhDC"", ""start_span"": 212, ""end_span"": 217, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
"Therefore, in the absence of CheZ, CheY is maintained in the phosphorylated state, "" locking "" flagellar rotation in the CW direction, and hence minimizing infection by chi - phage."	"CheZ	29	33	Protein"	"CheY	35	39	Protein"	"chi	169	172	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""CheZ"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CheY"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""chi"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 172, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
To investigate this possibility, we introduced flhDC - lacZ translational fusions in the deletion strains and performed beta - galactosidase assays.	"flhDC	47	52	Protein"	"lacZ	55	59	Protein"	"beta - galactosidase	120	140	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""flhDC"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""lacZ"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""beta - galactosidase"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Surprisingly, a large fraction of the mutants tested showed significant reduction in flhDC - lacZ expression values relative to the wild - type strain, demonstrating that the motility defects can be partly attributed to reduced expression of the flhDC operon.	"flhDC	85	90	Protein"	"lacZ	93	97	Protein"	"flhDC	246	251	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""flhDC"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""lacZ"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""flhDC"", ""start_span"": 246, ""end_span"": 251, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In addition, we noticed that LPS mutants varied widely in flhDC expression and that the repression of this operon, and the corresponding motility defect, were related to the degree of LPS truncation ( Figure 4).	"LPS	29	32	Chemical"	"flhDC	58	63	Protein"	"LPS	184	187	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""LPS"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""flhDC"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""LPS"", ""start_span"": 184, ""end_span"": 187, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
The widespread influence of LPS and OPG mutations on swimming, swarming, and chi - phage infection prompted us to explore the genetic mechanism of these mutations in more detail.	"LPS	28	31	Chemical"	"OPG	36	39	Chemical"	"chi	77	80	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""LPS"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""OPG"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""chi"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Previous evidence links LPS and OPG mutations to the activation of the Rcs phosphorelay system [ 34, 35], and the Rcs system is known to negatively regulate the flhDC operon [ 36].	"LPS	24	27	Chemical"	"OPG	32	35	Chemical"	"flhDC	161	166	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LPS"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""OPG"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""flhDC"", ""start_span"": 161, ""end_span"": 166, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
An flhD mutant was used as a chi - phage - resistant control and, as expected, showed no sensitivity, whereas chi - phage multiplied rapidly in the presence of the wild - type strain ( Figure 5A).	"flhD	3	7	Protein"	"chi	29	32	Organism"	"chi	110	113	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flhD"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""chi"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""chi"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We found that mutants with OPG defects and severe LPS truncations were incapable of swarming and that introducing DeltarcsF deletions into these mutants was sufficient to rescue the phenotype ( Figures 3F and S6).	"OPG	27	30	Chemical"	"LPS	50	53	Chemical"	"DeltarcsF	114	123	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""OPG"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""LPS"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""DeltarcsF"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These data indicate that LPS and OPG are not directly necessary for swarming, and that the behavior exhibited by such mutants results from Rcs - mediated repression of the flhDC operon.	"LPS	25	28	Chemical"	"OPG	33	36	Chemical"	"flhDC	172	177	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LPS"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""OPG"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""flhDC"", ""start_span"": 172, ""end_span"": 177, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Based on these observations, we hypothesized that this mutant has flagella with an extreme CCW rotation bias, a phenotype also exhibited, to varying degrees, by cheA, cheR, and cheW mutants [ 43].	"cheA	161	165	Protein"	"cheR	167	171	Protein"	"cheW	177	181	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cheA"", ""start_span"": 161, ""end_span"": 165, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheR"", ""start_span"": 167, ""end_span"": 171, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheW"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 181, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In a final functional test, individual cells of four different strains - wild - type cells and mutants with yhjH, cheR, and cheZ deletions - were tethered to a microscope slide and the frequency of flagellar rotation switching was measured using computer tracking software in a fashion similar to Block et al.	"yhjH	108	112	Protein"	"cheR	114	118	Protein"	"cheZ	124	128	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""yhjH"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheR"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cheZ"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The other half of DeltayhjH suppressor mutations were found to contain insertions within the intergenic region between the divergently transcribed genes yfgF and yfgG, which encode gene products of unknown function.	"DeltayhjH	18	27	Protein"	"yfgF	153	157	Protein"	"yfgG	162	166	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DeltayhjH"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""yfgF"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""yfgG"", ""start_span"": 162, ""end_span"": 166, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, deletions of either yfgF or yfgG produced no measurable difference in motility in the DeltayhjH background ( Figure S9).	"yfgF	29	33	Protein"	"yfgG	37	41	Protein"	"DeltayhjH	95	104	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""yfgF"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""yfgG"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""DeltayhjH"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Conversely, overexpression of yfgF ( but not yfgG) was found to suppress the motility defect of DeltayhjH mutants ( Figure 6E).	"yfgF	30	34	Protein"	"yfgG	45	49	Protein"	"DeltayhjH	96	105	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""yfgF"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""yfgG"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""DeltayhjH"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The mechanisms by which deletion of yegE and overexpression of yfgF suppress the motility defect of DeltayhjH mutants are discussed in the next section.	"yegE	36	40	Protein"	"yfgF	63	67	Protein"	"DeltayhjH	100	109	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""yegE"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""yfgF"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""DeltayhjH"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
YhjH contains an EAL domain, and expression of this protein leads to the degradation of c - di - GMP and enhanced motility in S. enterica [ 52].	"YhjH	0	4	Protein"	"EAL	17	20	Protein"	"c - di - GMP	88	100	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""YhjH"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""EAL"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""c - di - GMP"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
If c - di - GMP levels act globally and can influence motility, then insertions in many of the genes containing active GGDEF domains should rescue motility in the DeltayhjH double mutant library.	"c - di - GMP	3	15	Chemical"	"GGDEF	119	124	Protein"	"DeltayhjH	163	172	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""c - di - GMP"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""GGDEF"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""DeltayhjH"", ""start_span"": 163, ""end_span"": 172, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, it has been reported that c - di - GMP binds to the PilZ domain of the aforementioned YcgR protein [ 48].

Such an interaction may explain the observed rotational bias of flagella in DeltayhjH mutants ( Figure 6B) and is in agreement with our finding that mutations in ycgR strongly suppress the motility defects of DeltayhjH mutants ( Figure 6F).

The observations that the DeltayhjH mutant is impaired in swimming but indistinguishable from the wild - type strain in swarming, while in contrast the DeltayfiR strain cannot swarm and is only mildly impaired in swimming, support the notion that c - di - GMP signaling pathways are temporally and / or spatially separated, as recently suggested by others [ 58, 59].

Multilocus sequence typing ( MLST) showed that OG1RF is clonally distinct from V583 ( differs in six out of seven alleles of housekeeping genes) [ 11] and characterization of regions flanking transposon insertions in OG1RF suggested that approximately 10% of their sequences differed [ 12].

In addition to its virulence, the main reasons for the extensive use of OG1RF as a laboratory strain are that it does not carry plasmids, is readily transformable by electroporation, and is not resistant to commonly used antibiotics, other than rifampicin and fusidic acid.

The cumulative contribution of the secreted cysteine protease SpeB to the pathogenesis of invasive GAS infection is at present unclear, and studies in various GAS serotypes and animal models have produced varying results [ 19] - [ 21].

In the globally - disseminated clonal M1T1 serotype associated with epidemic invasive GAS infection, an inverse relationship has been found between SpeB activity and clinical disease severity [ 8].

RopB has previously been shown to be necessary for SpeB production [ 23], [ 24] as well as regulation of other GAS virulence factors [ 25] - [ 29].

Restoration of full - length RopB in 5628R + resulted in gaining SpeB expression, but did not result in changes in hemolysis, DNase activity or resistance to killing by neutrophils.

Recently, we have demonstrated that WT, SpeB - positive bacteria undergo a phase - shift to a SpeB - negative phenotype after subcutaneous infection of mice [ 17].

Of the down - regulated genes in CovR / S mutant strains, SpeB would appear to be one of the most important due to its ability to degrade many host and self - proteins.	"CovR	33	37	Protein"	"S	40	41	Protein"	"SpeB	58	62	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CovR"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""S"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SpeB"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It is the loss of SpeB expression in these mutant bacteria that is hypothesized to allow the invasive spread of GAS by sparing from SpeB degradation self - proteins involved in plasminogen accumulation and activation [ 42].	"SpeB	18	22	Protein"	"GAS	112	115	Organism"	"SpeB	132	136	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SpeB"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GAS"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""SpeB"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In this study we found that SpeB - positive bacteria with a restored RopB reverted to a SpeB - negative phenotype on subcutaneous infection.

Furthermore, the switch to a SpeB - negative phenotype appeared to occur exclusively through mutations in covR / S.

Moreover, these data suggest that SpeB loss, only in the context of mutation of the covR / S regulatory circuit, promotes invasion.

Streptokinase and M1 protein are believed to play a role in the accumulation of host plasmin at the GAS cell surface, a process which is thought to accentuate invasive disease [ 5], [ 42], [ 43].

While co - immunoprecipiatation has proven valuable in identifying targets of Hfq, and thus targets of translational regulation, one possible criticism of this approach is that the RNA co - immunoprecipitated with Hfq may be brought down simply because Hfq strongly binds to RNA molecules and that the binding is somewhat non - specific.

The RpoS regulon in Salmonella Typhimurium has been initially characterized, identifying 13 conserved RpoS - regulated genes [ 48].

From our global proteomics analysis we were able to observe gene products for 8 of the 13 conserved RpoS - regulated genes, of which only a single protein, YciF, was regulated by SmpB.

In P. temperata lysR gene encoding transcriptional activator was induced, while genes yijC and rseA encoding transcriptional repressors were induced in X. koppenhoeferi.

Photorhabdus temperata induced genes for amino acid acquisition but X. koppenhoeferi upregulated malF gene, encoding a maltose uptake system.

For example, in Photorhabdus, mutational inactivation of phoP gene results in increased sensitivity to insect immune response and decreased virulence towards insects [ 6, 7], while in X. nematophila, phoPQ mutants are more susceptible to immune response but are fully virulent [ 3].

However, the genomes of Xenorhabdus bovienii and X. nematophila do not show homologues of LopT or a dedicated type III secretion system [ 3], and Xenorhabdus likely uses flagellar regulatory cascade to control cellular immunity [ 15].

For example, regulation of genes yncB and purH in P. temperata are influenced by aromatic compounds and formate, respectively ( see Additional file 1).

Further, in P. temperata, lysR gene encoding a transcriptional activator protein was found to be upregulated during infection of R. majalis, while two genes yijC and rseA encoding transcriptional repressors were identified in X. koppenhoeferi.

Unlike Photorhabdus, the genomes of Xenorhabdus bovienii and X. nematophila do not encode homologues of a dedicated type III secretion system [ 3], indicating that Xenorhabdus likely uses different effectors or secretion systems.

Gene surA is important for bacterial survival during infection [ 41, 42] to avoid accumulation of non - native protein conformations [ 42 - 44], and uspB gene product is usually accumulated in the stationary phase and probably important for ethanol stress [ 45].

Thus, although gshB and gor corresponding products are involved in different glutathione biosynthesis pathways, expression of these two genes may suggests possible role of detoxification mechanism in P. temperata and X. koppenhoeferi during infection of R. majalis.

In contrast, two genes kdgK and pckA involved in energy metabolism in the TCA cycle were upregulated in P. temperata [ 54, 55].

Genes related to the TCA cycle have been also found to be induced in other bacteria upon host infection, for example in P. luminescens in the presence of G. mellonella homogenate [ 16] and in Vibrio cholerae upon infection of infant mice [ 56, 57].

Further, as a cofactor in the metabolism of fatty acids and leucine, biotin plays a role in TCA cycle by assisting in metabolic reactions and helping to transfer carbon dioxide [ 58].

Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus bacteria appear to share more genes in host - induced stress protection category, including tolerance against universal stresses, glutathione - mediated protection against oxidative stress, and protection against nucleic acid damage, compared to genes in all other categories.

While many virulence factors have been identified, such as lipopolysaccharides, capsular polysaccharides, Apx toxins and iron acquisition systems [ 4], or suggested, like biofilm formation [ 8], autotransporter adhesin [ 9] and autotransporter protease synthesis [ 10], very little is known about the overall contribution of each component to the infection process.

These studies demonstrated the importance of anaerobic metabolism and HlyX - regulated mechanisms during A. pleuropneumoniae infection in the lungs, and led to the identification and characterisation of a maturation autotransporter protease, AasP, responsible for cleavage and release of fragments of OmlA from the cell surface [ 19].

To survive in the host environment, Salmonella enterica uses a type III secretion system and effector proteins, which are activated by the SsrA - SsrB two - component system in response to the host environment.

These experiments showed that the sseA ' sequence contributes approximately 75% of transcriptional output at the sseA promoter ( Figure 6C), since deleting the single heptamer in the sseA IGR had little effect on transcriptional output in any of the strain backgrounds.

We also identified many weakly co - expressed genes, some of which may represent ancestral Salmonella genes recruited into the SsrB regulon like the previously reported srfN [ 18].

The SSR - 3 region in S. glossinidius is fully conserved in gene synteny and content with that of SPI - 2 [ 31], with the exception of two effector genes missing in SSR - 3 ( sseF and sseG) that are required to localize vacuolar Salmonella to the perinuclear Golgi in host cells [ 38], [ 39].

To the contrary, high local conservation in the promoters evolved in Salmonella and Sodalis was the crux in defining the functional SsrB input among stochastic noise.

Salmonella may have retained or evolved SsrB input here to create a positive feedback loop on the regulatory system to rapidly adapt to the host environment during infection, similar to transcriptional surge described for the PhoP response regulator [ 40].

Having previously reported that M1T1 Streptococcus pyogenes become hypervirulent in mice due to selection of mutants in the covRS regulatory genes, we set out to dissect the impact of these mutations in vitro and in vivo from the impact of other adaptive events.

Additionally, our results reflect that WT bacteria ' s rapid host - adaptive transcriptional reprogramming was not sufficient for their survival, and they were outnumbered by hypervirulent covS mutants with SpeB - / Sdahigh phenotype, which survived up to 14 days in mice chambers.

Group A streptococci ( GAS) are human pathogens that infect over 700 million children and adults each year [ 1].

Among the various GAS serotypes, the globally disseminated M1T1 clonal strain remains the most frequently isolated from cases of invasive and non - invasive infections [ 2], [ 3], and although disease severity partially depends on host genetic factors [ 4], [ 5], [ 6], M1T1 GAS possesses unique genomic features that contribute to its evolutionary fitness [ 7], [ 8], [ 9], [ 10].

Mutations in covS are thus expected to affect CovR phosphorylation status differentially in vitro and in vivo ( under stress conditions), and to consequently modulate CovRS signaling - regulation circuits in a complex manner that remains largely unexplored.

One of these preserved factors is the highly potent DNase, Sda1, which destroys neutrophil extracellular traps, NETs [ 36], protecting the bacteria from neutrophil killing, promoting bacterial invasion, and facilitating human plasminogen - mediated bacterial dissemination into normally sterile sites, which results in invasive infections [ 14].

To address these issues and improve our understanding of the gene regulatory impact of mutational and adaptive events contributing to the hypervirulent phenotype of M1T1 strains, we analyzed differences in growth requirements, transcriptome profiles, and regulatory circuits of the virulent ( WT) and hypervirulent ( AP) phenotypes of the M1T1 strain both in vitro and during initial in vivo infection.

Minimal media are not optimal for the expression of GAS proteins, which may explain why GAS failed to grow at many of the PM conditions ( Fig. S1) and why fewer phenotypic differences were observed between WT and AP bacteria than transcriptomic differences ( see below).

For example, the expression of genes in the SLS and Trx operons is induced in vivo only in WT bacteria, but is mostly repressed in AP bacteria ( Fig. 2, CC6) both in vitro and in vivo.

It is possible that SLS is regulated by the catabolite control protein ( CcpA), which was recently shown to be another key transcriptional regulator of the SLS operon [ 46] and which may override CovR - mediated repression of SLS.

The TrxRS system reportedly responds to a yet - to - be - identified extracellular signal while TrxR itself is directly regulated by CovR [ 42].

These in vivo - selected bacteria with the AP phenotype could be differentiated from the WT bacteria by mutations that are clustered in the sensor kinase - encoding covS gene in AP bacteria [ 14], [ 27].

SpeB is a major virulence factor in GAS pathogenesis and its expression is regulated by different systems [ 40], [ 56], [ 57], [ 58], including the CovRS system [ 20], [ 53].

Finally, genes encoding the antiphagocytic M protein, and the toxins streptolysin O and NADGH were among few genes that were upregulated in all conditions except WT - vitro ( Fig. 2, CC7), which suggests that their transcription is dependent on multiple signals, including signals from the host as well as covS - dependent cues.

It is noteworthy that SpeB expression has a dominant effect, since even if secreted in low amounts by a minor subpopulation, this broad - spectrum protease would still be able to degrade, fully or partially, many GAS virulence proteins, including Sda1, thereby rendering the bacteria vulnerable to different effector mechanisms of the host ' s innate immune system including neutrophil killing [ 14], [ 67], [ 68].

4, the mortality rate caused by sak189 / sak188 double mutant strain significantly differed in comparison with that caused by the wild - type and sak188 mutant strains.	"sak189	32	38	Protein"	"sak188	41	47	Protein"	"sak188	146	152	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""sak189"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak188"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak188"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Compared to the wild - type strain, the differences in virulent properties were statistically significant in case of sak189 / sak188 double mutant strain ( P - value < 0. 02), and not significant in case of sak188 mutant strain ( P - value = 0. 73).	"sak189	117	123	Protein"	"sak188	126	132	Protein"	"sak188	207	213	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""sak189"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak188"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak188"", ""start_span"": 207, ""end_span"": 213, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In this study, we investigated the functional role of Sak188 / Sak189 two - component system in regulation of the expression of beta - antigen, an important virulence factor of S. agalactiae.

Variety of publications are currently available regarding the occurrence of bac gene among S. agalactiae strains as well as genetic polymorphism of bac gene and use of encoded beta - antigen as a vaccine component [ 32], [ 34] - [ 38].	"bac	76	79	Protein"	"bac	148	151	Protein"	"beta - antigen	176	190	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bac"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""bac"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""beta - antigen"", ""start_span"": 176, ""end_span"": 190, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In this study, both sak188 and bac genes located downstream the sak189 gene ( Fig. 1).

3, insertional inactivation of sak189 affected bac gene transcription, while insertional inactivation of the sak188 did not affect.	"sak189	31	37	Protein"	"bac	47	50	Protein"	"sak188	109	115	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""sak189"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""bac"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""sak188"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It is also possible that bac gene encoding for beta - antigen is not only target for Sak188 / Sak189 TCS.	"beta - antigen	47	61	Protein"	"Sak188	85	91	Protein"	"Sak189	94	100	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""beta - antigen"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Sak188"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Sak189"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Inactivation of histidine kinase Sak188 does not affect transcription of bac gene and expression of beta - antigen, that suggests the cross - talk between Sak189 and other sensor kinase ( s) in S. agalactiae.
