The PmrB protein is necessary for activation of the PmrA protein in low Mg2 + ( Kox et al., 2000; Kato and Groisman, 2004) and in the presence of Fe3 + ( Wosten et al., 2000), consistent with the notion that PmrB is the major phosphodonor for PmrA.

This acid pH - promoted increase appears to be specific to a subset of PhoP - activated genes ( our unpublished results) that includes pmrD because expression of the PhoP - regulated slyA gene and the PhoP - independent corA gene was not affected by the pH of the medium ( Fig. 4A).

On the other hand, although mild acid ( pH 6. 0) per se, i. e. even in the presence of high Mg2 +, promotes LPS modifications ( Gibbons et al., 2005), the low pH signal may also act synergistically with the low Mg2 + signal in vivo because Mg2 + deprivation alone is not sufficient to provide all the LPS modifications seen in Salmonella when present inside macrophages ( Gibbons et al., 2005).
