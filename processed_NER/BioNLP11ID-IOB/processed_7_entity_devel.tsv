The PmrA protein and its cognate sensor kinase PmrB form a two - component regulatory system that is required for virulence in mice ( Gunn et al., 2000), infection of chicken macrophages ( Zhao et al., 2002), growth in soil ( Chamnongpol et al., 2002), resistance to the cationic peptide antibiotic polymyxin B ( Roland et al., 1993) and resistance to Fe3 + - ( Wosten et al., 2000) and Al3 + - mediated killing ( Nishino et al., 2006).

Although it has been suggested that the Salmonella PhoQ protein senses acid pH ( Aranda et al., 1992) or responds to both pH and Mg2 + ( Bearson et al., 1998), a direct role for PhoQ in responding to acid pH appears unlikely because not all PhoP - regulated genes are activated under these conditions, which is in contrast to low Mg2 + activating the whole PhoP regulon ( see Groisman and Mouslim, 2006 for a review).

To identify the target gene in SPI1 that is regulated by Mlc, the expression patterns of the SPI1 - regulatory genes, which include hilA, invF, hilC and hilD, were examined by primer extension analysis of total RNA from SL1344 and SR1304 grown statically to the exponential phase.

Additionally, the over - expression of HilD from the plasmid pJB3 containing hilD gene under the control of a lac promoter caused the induction of hilA by approximately2 - fold and invF by approximately6 - fold irrespective of hilE or mlc mutation when real - time PCR was used to compare the expression levels ( data not shown).

SL1344 and SR1304 carrying either pMAB69 ( hilE - lacZY) or pJB5 ( hilD - lacZY) were cultivated in TB that was buffered to pH 7. 0 with 0. 1M MOPS, to minimize pH effects arising from growth in the presence of the various carbon sources.

The hilC mutation had little effect on SPI1 gene expression or the invasive phenotype, whereas the over - expression of hilC suppressed the hilD mutation, thereby promoting high levels of hilA and invF expression, which suggests that HilC can partially compensate for the loss of function of HilD and the invasive phenotype ( 8, 9, 15).

On the negative strand of 89K, peptides encoded by 05SSU0944 and 05SSU0943 exhibit 27% and 41% amino acid sequence identity with the SalK and the SalR proteins of Streptococcus salivarius, respectively, forming a TCSTS belonging to the Nar / LuxR family.

Downstream of salKR, the 05SSU0942, 05SSU0941, 05SSU0940, 05SSU0939, 05SSU0938 genes were predicted to encode peptides with significant identities to the orthologues of Streptococcus agalactiae.

These results suggested that salK and salR are transcriptionally coupled, and the five downstream ( 05SSU0942 - 05SSU0938) genes are co - transcribed from a promoter positioned immediately upstream of 05SSU0942 and that their transcription ends between the 05SSU0938 - 05SSU0937 intergenic region which contains a terminator - like inverted repeat sequence.
