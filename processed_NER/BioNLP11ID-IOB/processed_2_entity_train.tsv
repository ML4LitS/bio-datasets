We undertook the present study to understand and to assess more accurately the genome - wide transcriptional responses of streptococci during one of the earliest recognized stages of infection, namely adherence to human pharyngeal cells.

We verified the differential expression of spy2039 and spy0130 by qRT - PCR.

Streptolysin O is a cytotoxin that damages human tissue and increases host cell cytotoxicity [ 7, 25].

Based on its downregulation during adherence, we infer that slo was transcribed during pre - adherence associations, perhaps, as previously reported, to protect streptococci from phagocytic killing in vivo [ 27].

When SpeB expression is limited, several streptococcal proteins necessary for adherence remain intact [ 24, 32, 33]; thus, decreased SpeB production ( as indicated here) may promote pharyngeal cell attachment.

We observed significant upregulation of the gene spy0130, encoding a protein recently found to be associated with the production of surface - exposed pili on strain SF370 [ 36].

The speH gene ( spy1008) was induced, and the remaining genes, hypothetically involved in replication and regulation [ 39], were downregulated.

Increased expression of speH during pharyngeal cell adherence suggests that the SpeH exotoxin is either necessary for adherence, or is a component of a downstream infection process.

We observed no significant difference in adherence between the wild - type ( SF370) and mutant strains ( Figure 1B), indicating that SpeH is not involved directly in attachment to the pharyngeal cell.

We obtained a similar result for the eight - gene operon encoding the F0F1 - type proton translocating ATPase [ 41] ( spy0754 - 0761).

We determined experimentally that cluster spy0127 - 0130 is an operon, verifying both related function and regulation of the gene members.

Allelic replacement created two putative deletion mutants; however, RT - PCR analysis ( Figure 4A) revealed that only one such clone ( SF370Deltaspy0129. 2) was a true knock - out for the spy0129 gene and useful for further study.

In vitro pharyngeal cell adherence assays revealed that the SF370Deltaspy0129. 2 mutant was approximately 66% less adherent than the parental control strain, SF370 ( Figure 4B; p = 0. 03 as determined by the Student ' s t - test).

These results suggest that either the spy0130 gene product is involved directly in adherence, or that due to the elimination of the sortase, the pili, which may function in their entirety as adhesins, were not assembled on the surface of the mutant.

We are working to produce an in - frame deletion of spy0128 and a spy0130 single knock - out mutant to delineate the contribution of each individual clustered gene product to adherence.

Another cluster, spy1725 - 1719, contained six genes that together ( though not individually) exhibited significant downregulation.

We examined the spy1725 and spy1723 gene products ( annotated as hypothetical proteins [ 14]) for similarities with known proteins that might indicate a role for these gene products in protein biosynthesis.

The spy1723 gene product has similar domain structure to the YlxR protein of S. pneumoniae, an RNA - binding protein implicated in transcription termination [ 53].

For example, the algorithm identified a significant neighbor cluster spanning spy0711 - 0712.

This grouping encodes two known virulence factors, pyrogenic exotoxin SpeC and the MF2 DNase, previously shown to be commonly regulated as an operon [ 11].

Nonetheless, neighbor clustering provided a more comprehensive view of the transcriptome of group A streptococci during adherence to human pharyngeal cells, a critical step in the infection program of this organism.

Here, the novel finding that FimR, a member of the two - component regulatory system, is a transcriptional activator of the mfa1 gene is promoted.

The function of the FimA protein and regulation of fimA expression have been extensively studied.

A P. gingivalis fimA mutant shows impaired invasion capability of epithelial cells compared with wild - type strain, suggesting the involvement of FimA in the bacterial interaction with surface receptor ( s) on gingival cells ( Weinberg et al., 1997).

In a nutrient - limited medium, expression of FimA and Mfa1 are inhibited in P. gingivalis, whereas such differences are not found in gingipain expression.

In this study, it is demonstrated that FimR is a positive regulator of Mfa1 expression.

Statistically significant differences of the level of gene expression in 33277 and the fimR - mutant were calculated by a Student ' s t - test.

This analysis revealed that the expression of the fimA and mfa1 genes was consistent at the mRNA level and protein level ( Fig. 1b).

It is likely that mfa1 gene possesses two functional promoters, which are also detected in the fimA gene of P. gingivalis ( Xie & Lamont, 1999; Nishikawa et al., 2004).

The rHGP44 protein, a binding domain of P. gingivalis gingipains ( Xie et al., 2006), expressed in the same system and purified by the same procedures as rFimR was used as a control.

A number of overlapping cosmid clones that gave enhanced growth and survival in the spleens of infected mice relative to that of wild - type H37Ra were identified [ 9].

Microarray - Based Comparative Genome Sequencing of M. tuberculosis H37Ra The genome - wide comparative mutational analysis of H37Ra and H37Rv was carried out by NimbleGen Systems following a previously published method [ 13].

Since secreted proteins of the ESX - 1 system of M. tuberculosis constitute a major interface between the bacterium and its host [ 23], we analyzed the different strains for their potential to induce T cell responses against ESAT - 6 and its binding partner, the 10 - kD culture filtrate protein CFP - 10.

Two weeks after vaccination we assessed the interferon - gamma ( IFN - gamma) production of splenocytes mounted against ESX - 1 antigens or controls.

Most importantly, the various strains differed extensively in their potential to induce antigen specific T cell responses towards ESAT - 6 and CFP - 10.

To further evaluate the involvement of phoP and the ESX - 1 system in immunogenicity, C57BL / 6 mice were vaccinated with additional strains.

We have previously shown that antigen - specific IFN - gamma production of splenocytes is a reliable readout system to evaluate whether or not ESAT - 6 was secreted by recombinant strains [ 23, 24, 26].

However, hardly any ESAT - 6 was present in the culture filtrates of these cultures, indicating that these strains were unable to secrete ESAT - 6 under the in vitro conditions employed in spite of proper expression.

Analysis of the M. tuberculosis MT103 phoP ko strain SO2 showed strong expression of ESAT - 6, but only very little secreted ESAT - 6 ( Figure 5).

These findings are consistent with data from a previous transcriptional study [ 12] and suggest that the proposed ability of PhoP to downregulate its own expression [ 22] is affected by the S219L phoP mutation [ 29].

The attenuated H37Ra strain was obtained at the Trudeau Institute in the 1930s in an attempt to dissociate virulent and avirulent forms of the tubercle bacillus H37.

Although these different H37 daughter strains have been available for many years now and belong to the standard strain collections of almost every tuberculosis diagnostic or research laboratory in the world [ 30, 31], the genetic basis of the decreased virulence of H37Ra remained unknown.

For M. tuberculosis, several studies have described a link between the inactivation of phoP and loss of virulence, suggesting that the phoP gene is required for intracellular growth of M. tuberculosis [ 14, 25].

There were also several ppe genes that seem to be regulated by phoP but not ppe68 [ 21].

[ 12] show substantial differences between cultures grown in roller bottles relative to cultures grown in shake flasks, arguing that this gene cluster might be regulated by environmental conditions through the PhoP / PhoR system.

Furthermore, rv3614c - rv3616c were reported to be transiently upregulated in the phagosome and under acidic stress [ 38].

Construction of such strains has recently been initiated as a first step of a future study to gain deeper insight into signaling events and regulation of the ESX - 1 secretion system in different tubercle bacilli, including members of the putative progenitor species Mycobacterium prototuberculosis [ 40].

In conclusion, in this work we report the identification and profound consequences of the PhoP S219L mutation on the widely used H37Ra strain.

BLASTP comparisons of the PhoP sequence showed that the predicted DNA binding region, where the mutation occurred, is perfectly conserved among a wide range of actinobacteria, with H37Ra being the only strain showing such a mutation.

By complementation with the wild - type copy of PhoP, we obtained a significant increase in virulence in ex vivo and animal models as well as restoration of ESAT - 6 secretion and the accompanying antigen - specific immunological recognition by sensitized splenocytes or T cell hybridomas.

Indeed, preliminary comparison of the 4. 4 - Mb genome of H37Rv [ 7] ( NC _ 000962) with the recently accessible H37Ra genome ( NC _ 009525) revealed 194 differences, including 126 SNPs, 16 deletions, 27 insertions, and 25 substitutions.

At present, we do not know how many of these differences actually contribute to the attenuation of H37Ra, and it also remains to be determined how many differences exist among the various H37Ra strains that are presently used in the worldwide tuberculosis research laboratories.

The link described here between mutation of phoP and consequences on ESAT - 6 secretion, however, appears to be one factor that significantly contributes to attenuation.

Comparative analysis of the Photorhabdus luminescens and the Yersinia enterocolitica genomes: uncovering candidate genes involved in insect pathogenicity	"Photorhabdus luminescens	28	52	Organism"	"Yersinia enterocolitica	61	84	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Photorhabdus luminescens"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Yersinia enterocolitica"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Background Photorhabdus luminescens and Yersinia enterocolitica are both enteric bacteria which are associated with insects.

In addition, the genetic overlap unravelled a two - component system that is unique for the genera Photorhabdus and Yersinia and is therefore suggested to play a major role in the pathogen - insect relationship.

We therefore decided to perform a comparative study of the genomes of Photorhabdus luminescens and Yersinia enterocolitica.

However, Y. pestis, a blood - borne pathogen and the etiological agent of human plague, has long been known to be transmitted by insects, specifically by rat fleas.

In contrast, Photorhabdus luminescens is predominantly an insect pathogenic enterobacterium which maintains a mutualistic interaction with heterorhabditid nematodes, and can infect a wide range of insects [ 11, 12].

It is assumed that these strains are associated with spiders, because spider bites where attended with Photorhabdus human infections [ 15].

In P. luminescens, this TCS controls the expression of the pbgPE operon which is involved in lipid A modification and thus plays a role in colonization and infection of the invertebrate hosts [ 18, 31].

Therefore, the KdpD / KdpE system is also a further candidate system which might be involved in the regulation of insecticidal activity of Y. enterocolitica.

The only TCS of P. luminescens absent in Y. enterocolitica is TctE / TctD ( Fig. 2, marked in blue), which, however, is found in the genomes of Y. intermedia and Y. frederiksenii.

Instead of producing AHLs to regulate quorum dependent genes, a common strategy of insect - colonizing bacteria might be the detection of AHLs as a signal for the presence of other bacteria such as those colonizing the insect intestinal tract or living in soil.

Whether they sense self - produced or external AI - 2, or a combination of both, indicating a quorum sensing mechanism or a regulation similar to AHL as described above, remains to be elucidated.

It is interesting to note that there is only one bacterium else, the insect colonizing S. glossinidius, whose genome also carries a series of unclustered genes coding for PAS _ 4 / LuxR - like receptors, indicating that this kind of receptors plays a role during insect infection.	"PAS _ 4	171	178	Protein"	"LuxR	181	185	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PAS _ 4"", ""start_span"": 171, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""LuxR"", ""start_span"": 181, ""end_span"": 185, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, the potential PAS _ 4 / LuxR - like receptors of P. luminescens, Y. enterocolitica, and S. glossinidius might sense JH or other eukaryotic hormones of the insect to adapt their gene expression to the insect host.

This hypothesis is underlined by the fact that not more than five PAS _ 4 / LuxR - like receptors are present in S. glossinidius for which only one insect host has been reported.

In E. coli, the sequence motif of Usp proteins is not highly conserved: UspA and UspC show a sequence identity of 37% and a homology of 57%, for example.

In contrast, the UspA and the UspE homologues of P. luminescens and Y. enterocolitica are nearly similar, indicating that an identical stress response is regulated by these proteins.

It is discussed that the AstS / AstR - system prevents or delays phenotypic variation by protecting the cell from stress [ 18].

Phenotypic variation and thus the switch between mutualism and pathogenicity in P. luminescens is proposed to be regulated by a Ner - like and a HexA - like regulator that repress primary variant specific genes in the stage of the secondary variant [ 17].

Epidemiological and pathological findings, including sporadic incidents of severe invasive GAS infections [ 9], high frequency of severe invasive infections in immunocompromised host [ 9], and aggregation of bacteria and a paucity of polymorphnuclear neutrophils ( PMN) in foci of invasive GAS infection [ 10] suggest that host defense factors play an important role in the onset of invasive infections.

This suggestion is further supported by the observations that both the wild - type and DeltavicK mutant strains are resistant to phagocytosis by PMNs, which suggest that VicRK is not required for the evasion of S. equi to the innate immunity.

Secondly, DeltavicK inoculation protects mice against subsequent infection with wild - type S. equi.

To cause a systemic infection, Salmonella must respond to many environmental cues during mouse infection and express specific subsets of genes in a temporal and spatial manner, but the regulatory pathways are poorly established.

More than 4% of the entire genome is required for Typhimurium to infect the mouse [ 3].

During the course of systemic infection in mice, bacteria are found within neutrophils, monocytes, dendritic cells, and B and T cells but are not found extracellularly until the last one or two days immediately before death of the mouse [ 15] - [ 17].

Mutations that resulted in either no deaths, one death, or delayed death of infected mice were retested with groups of 5 mice at the same dose ( Figure 1A).

To validate this result we complemented the spvR mutation in trans and found complete complementation in mouse virulence ( Figure S1).

The ability of Salmonella to survive and replicate in macrophages is necessary but not sufficient for mouse virulence	"Salmonella	15	25	Organism"	"mouse	102	107	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Previous work demonstrated that Salmonella mutants that were unable to survive within elicited peritoneal macrophages were attenuated for virulence during systemic mouse infection [ 36].

It is possible that growth in cells types other than macrophages is necessary for Salmonella to cause a systemic infection in mice following i. p. administration.

In these studies we used primary bone marrow - derived macrophages ( BMDM) from the same strain of mouse as used in the original identification of attenuated regulatory mutants ( BALB / c).

No effect was found at any time point for a mutant in the plasmid - encoded regulator spvR in murine macrophages in agreement with other investigators [ 41], [ 42].

To identify global transcriptional changes for each regulator, mRNAs were isolated from each strain grown under the four conditions, converted to cDNA, and used to probe a spotted non - redundant pan - Salmonella orf microarray using hybridization of total genomic Salmonella DNA as an internal control [ 50].	"Salmonella	202	212	Organism"	"Salmonella	265	275	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 202, ""end_span"": 212, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 265, ""end_span"": 275, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
To assess the effects of growth conditions on expression of the SPI - 2 secretion apparatus we constructed a lacZ transcriptional fusion to ssaG, a component of the secretion apparatus, and tested expression in each mutant background under each of the four growth conditions.	"lacZ	109	113	Protein"	"ssaG	140	144	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""lacZ"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ssaG"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
At the same time we determined transcript levels via quantitative real - time PCR ( qRT - PCR), using transcripts from rpoD and gyrB as controls [ 51].	"rpoD	119	123	Protein"	"gyrB	128	132	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""rpoD"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""gyrB"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We observed that the results determined by these two methods matched closely ( Figure S2) and that the level of transcription of ssaG was highest when Salmonella was grown in minimal acidic media.	"ssaG	129	133	Protein"	"Salmonella	151	161	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""ssaG"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 151, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Note that rpoE and hfq mutants showed a dramatic reduction in macrophage survival, but little difference in transcription of SPI - 2 genes during growth in AMM.	"rpoE	10	14	Protein"	"hfq	19	22	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""rpoE"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hfq"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It has recently been reported that the translational regulator Hfq, regulates translation of RpoE explaining in part why the two mutations behave similarly [ 54].	"Hfq	63	66	Protein"	"RpoE	93	97	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Hfq"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RpoE"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore, Hfq regulates translation of more than 20% of all Salmonella proteins explaining why a mutation in this gene has such a dramatic phenotype ( [ 54]; Charles Ansong, Hyunjin Yoon, Steffen Porwollik, Heather Mottaz - Brewer, Briana Ogata - Petritis, Navdeep Jaitly, Joshua N. Adkins, Michael McClelland, Fred Heffron, and Richard D. Smith; Global systems - level analysis of small RNA - mediated translational regulation: Implications for virulence and global protein translation; Submitted).

Several of these genes are A + T rich ( > 60% compared to 48% for the Salmonella chromosome) and located within sequences that are not present in close relatives of Salmonella suggesting that they may be unidentified secreted effectors or other virulence determinants that have been acquired from other pathogens.	"Salmonella	70	80	Organism"	"Salmonella	165	175	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 175, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We analyzed expression of each of the 123 genes and found that only two genes ( pepA and mopB) are negatively regulated; the remaining 121 are positively regulated.	"pepA	80	84	Protein"	"mopB	89	93	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""pepA"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""mopB"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
So, in Figure 6B all regulatory effects on SPI - 2 have been removed except for those mediated directly by slyA and ssrB based on additional genetic data as described below.	"slyA	107	111	Protein"	"ssrB	116	120	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""slyA"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ssrB"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Expression of an episomal copy of ssrB resulted in expression of SPI - 2 genes in each mutant background, suggesting that SsrB is epistatic to other regulators for SPI - 2 transcription.	"ssrB	34	38	Protein"	"SsrB	122	126	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ssrB"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This result is in agreement with the model shown in Figure 6 where all positive regulation takes place via either ssrB or slyA or both as tested further below.	"ssrB	114	118	Protein"	"slyA	122	126	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ssrB"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""slyA"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
slyA transcriptional activation by PhoP has been reported [ 63], [ 64].	"slyA	0	4	Protein"	"PhoP	35	39	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""slyA"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PhoP"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To determine epistatic relationships, we introduced a slyA - expressing plasmid, pBAD30SlyA, into each regulatory mutant and examined complementation in each mutant background compared to an empty vector control ( Figure 7C).	"slyA	54	58	Protein"	"pBAD30SlyA	81	91	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""slyA"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pBAD30SlyA"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This suggests that slyA can regulate expression of SPI - 2 in a way that is independent of ssrB.

The mutant strains devoid of 83 regulators were tested in three mouse virulence assays to identify a subset of 14 that were most highly attenuated in a systemic mouse infection model.

This result is striking, given that STM3117 - 3120 are not transcribed under a variety of in vitro conditions including AMM1 and 2 and the many conditions corresponding to the transcriptional profiles reported for microarrays archived in GEO ( [ 68], J. McDermott and L Shi, Unpubl. Obs.).

For SPI - 2 ssrB plays this role and for SPI - 1 hilA is the central regulator.	"ssrB	12	16	Protein"	"hilA	49	53	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ssrB"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""hilA"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Previous results have shown that a conservative replacement of the amino acid that is the essential phosphate acceptor eliminated expression of SPI - 2 genes suggesting that SsrB requires phosphorylation for activity.

Yet, expression of ssrB without ssrA results in expression of all 7 SPI - 2 genes examined ( Figure 7A).

Figure 6B shows that there is a close relationship between these two regulators and that they can both affect each other through the ompR / envZ two - component regulator.

Post - transcriptional SPI - 2 regulation is a likely explanation for the large intracellular growth defects observed in the mutant smpB and hfq derivatives despite relative small transcriptional effects.

Similarly SsrB binds upstream of ssrA in a region of the promoter typical of response regulators but has no obvious recognition site and binds within the operons that encode structural components of the type III secretion system [ 52], [ 81].	"SsrB	10	14	Protein"	"ssrA	33	37	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ssrA"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
[ 81] found that there was no consensus SsrB binding site or distance relative to the transcription start sites and Walthers ( ibid) proposes that different promoters may be activated by distinct SsrB mechanisms.	"SsrB	40	44	Protein"	"SsrB	196	200	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SsrB"", ""start_span"": 196, ""end_span"": 200, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This possibility may be reflected in the differences in expression of the five operons within SPI - 2 following ssrB and slyA over - expression.	"ssrB	112	116	Protein"	"slyA	121	125	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ssrB"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""slyA"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Induction of rv2623 also occurs when M. tuberculosis encounters conditions associated with growth arrest, such as the intracellular milieu of macrophages and in the lungs of mice with chronic tuberculosis.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis, one of the most successful human pathogens, infects one - third of the world ' s population, causing nearly two million deaths per year [ 1].

Nitric oxide ( NO) produced by infected macrophages and relative hypoxia are signals likely to be encountered within tuberculous lesions that are believed, based on in vitro studies, to promote latency by prompting the M. tuberculosis dormancy response.

Exposure to these stimuli results in the induction of approximately50 M. tuberculosis genes, designated the dormancy regulon, via the two - component regulatory system DosR - DosS ( see Table S1 for accession numbers) [ 3], [ 4], [ 5].

Increased expression of rv2623 was also observed following phagocytosis by macrophages [ 10] and in the lungs of chronically infected mice [ 11], supporting a functional role during persistent M. tuberculosis infection.

Although USP family proteins are expressed by many bacterial pathogens [ 7], [ 8], to date, there has only been one in vivo study, which showed that a Salmonella USP promotes virulence in mice [ 17].

Low dose aerosol infection of outbred Hartley guinea pigs with approximately30 CFU revealed a clear growth advantage of the Deltarv2623 mutant strain relative to wildtype.

As early as 20 days post - infection, the number of M. tuberculosis bacilli present in the lungs of Deltarv2623 - infected guinea pigs was approximately10 - fold higher ( p < 0. 05) than those infected with wildtype Erdman, and continued to rise, attaining a 15 - fold ( p < 0. 001) difference by 60 days post - infection ( Figure 3A).

Moreover, Deltarv2623 - infected guinea pigs were moribund at 60 days post - infection, while those challenged with wildtype Erdman remained relatively healthy, providing further evidence that the mutant strain is hypervirulent in this model.

Overall, the progression of pulmonic lesions was accelerated in Deltarv2623 - infected animals compared to those infected with wildtype Erdman, accompanied by more extensive necrosis and widespread fibrosis.

However, the mouse is a relatively resistant host to M. tuberculosis, particularly in strains such as C57BL / 6 [ 20], [ 21].

Consequently, we examined the virulence of Deltarv2623 in the relatively susceptible C3H / HeJ mouse strain [ 24].

Manifestation of this hypervirulence phenotype is apparent as early as 3 weeks post - infection, with the lung bacterial burden of mice infected with Deltarv2623 M. tuberculosis approximately100 fold higher than that in the wildtype - infected animals.

These results support the notion that it is unlikely that M. tuberculosis Rv2623 is essential for resistance to stresses encountered in the host, which is consistent with the observed in vivo hypervirulence phenotype of Deltarv2623.

Gel filtration analysis of native His6 - Rv2623 revealed that the purified protein exists primarily as a single species with an apparent molecular mass of 61 + / - 1 kDa; suggesting that Rv2623 is a dimer under native conditions ( Figure S3), an observation that was later confirmed using nano electrospray ionization ( nano ESI) mass spectrometry ( data not shown).

The presence of this motif in each of the two tandem USP domains of Rv2623 [ 7] raised the possibility that this protein possesses ATP binding activity.

To examine the biochemical mechanisms responsible for Rv2623 function, we determined the crystal structure of wild - type Rv2623 at a resolution of 2. 9 A.

Dimerization of Rv2623 occurs along a 2 - fold axis orthogonal to the intramonomer dyad and juxtaposes ATP binding pockets from opposing monomers ( Figure 6B).

Taken together, these data strongly suggest that the ability of Rv2623 to regulate growth of M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis is dependent on an ATP - dependent process.

These genes, referred to as the dormancy regulon, are transcriptionally regulated by the mycobacterial two - component system DosR - DosS under hypoxic conditions [ 4].

We studied the M. tuberculosis USP rv2623 because it is one of the most highly induced genes in the dormancy regulon when bacilli are subjected to hypoxia and nitrosative stress [ 3], [ 4], [ 5], [ 36], [ 37].

In summary, the results of the present study have revealed that the M. tuberculosis USP Rv2623 has the ability to regulate mycobacterial growth, as evident by the in vivo hypervirulence phenotype of Deltarv2623, which fails to establish a persistent infection in susceptible hosts, as well as the growth attenuation observed in mycobacteria overexpressing this USP.

As a result, Rv2623 may contribute significantly to the propagation of the tubercle bacillus in the human host and the difficulties in eradicating tuberculosis.

Recent identification of the DosR - dependent dormancy regulon [ 3], [ 4], [ 5]; the DosR - independent enduring hypoxic response, which involves over 200 mycobacterial genes, including those known to regulate bacteriostasis [ 42]; and the demonstration that M. tuberculosis redox and hypoxia sensors can interact with multiple ligands that differentially modulate the activity of these important kinases [ 28], [ 29], [ 30], [ 31], [ 32], predict a complex regulatory network for tuberculous latency.

Further, we demonstrate the interdependency of this two - component systems network with GacS ( PA0928), which was found to play a dual role in biofilm formation.

In contrast, type IV pili and flagella deletion mutants exhibited reduced attachment indicating that attachment and biofilm formation are mediated by extracellular appendages [ 12], [ 15] - [ 17].

Furthermore, the intracellular signaling molecule bis - ( 3 ' - 5 ') - cyclic diguanylic guanosine monophosphate ( cyclic - di - GMP), first described to control extracellular cellulose biosynthesis in Acetobacter xylinum [ 18], [ 19], has been demonstrated in several microorganisms to modulate biofilm formation via the production of exopolysaccharides or matrix components, control auto - aggregation of planktonic cells, and regulate swarming motility [ 20] - [ 32].

This multi - component switch thus orchestrates the transition from the planktonic to the biofilm mode of growth by P. aeruginosa via phosphorylation events of the two - component regulatory system GacA / GacS [ 36] - [ 38].

In contrast, PA4197 and PA4101 mutant biofilms lacked microcolonies after 144 hr of growth ( Fig. 2B) and were only composed of a thin layer of cells at the substratum with an average height of 0. 5 and 1. 4 microm, respectively ( Table 2).

However, in contrast to PA4197 mutant biofilms, PA4101 mutant biofilms demonstrated the formation of some cellular aggregates which were less than 10 microm in height ( Fig. 2B).

Complementation of both PA4101 and PA4197 mutants restored biofilm formation to wild type levels ( Fig. 2C, Table 2).

These results allowed us to firmly conclude that the mutant biofilm phenotypes are caused by a defect in the PA4197 and PA4101 ORF.

Based on the role of PA4197 in the initiation of biofilm formation, we named the PA4197 ORF Biofilm initiation Sensor ( BfiS).

Due to its role in biofilm maturation, we named the PA4101 ORF Biofilm maturation Regulator ( BfmR).

The cognate sensor BfmS ( PA4102) is unusual in that it lacks an autophosphorylation site typically found in sensor kinases [ 53].

Furthermore, no difference in growth in broth or defect with respect to twitching, swimming, and swarming or Pel and Psl polysaccharide production was detected for any of the mutant strains ( not shown).

In addition, no difference in transcript abundance, as determined by semi - quantitative RT - PCR, of genes involved in Pel and Psl polysaccharide biosynthesis compared to wild type was detected ( not shown).

To determine the stage at which DeltabfiS and DeltabfmR mutant biofilms were arrested, the biofilm architecture of the mutant strains after 144 hr of growth was compared to the wild type P. aeruginosa biofilm architecture following 24, 72, and 144 hr of growth ( Table 2).

Based on the comparison of 5 biofilm variables, both mutant biofilms were more similar to 24 - hr - old biofilms, with DeltabfmR forming more substantial biofilms than DeltabfiS or 24 hr wild type biofilms ( Table 2).

Arrest of biofilm formation at the 1 - day time point correlated with the timing of BfiS and BfmR phosphorylation ( Tables 1 - 2).

Comparison of the DeltamifR biofilm architecture following 144 hr of growth to wild type biofilms indicated that DeltamifR biofilms were comparable to 72 - hr - old biofilms.

Since MifR was detected to be phosphorylated following 72 hr of biofilm growth ( Table 1), our findings indicate that phosphorylation of MifR is essential for the progression of P. aeruginosa biofilms from the maturation - 1 stage ( 72 hr) to the maturation - 2 stage ( 144 hr).

The DeltabfiS and DeltabfmR biofilms resembled wild type biofilms with respect to biomass and overall architecture at the 24 hr time point ( see Fig. 2A - B).

However, while wild type biofilms continued to mature / develop upon prolonged incubation ( see Fig. 2A), no additional biomass accumulation or alteration in architecture was observed for DeltabfiS and DeltabfmR biofilms post 24 hr of growth.

These findings suggest that GacS may play a dual role in regulating biofilm formation, which in turn may be dependent on the phosphorylation status of GacS ( Table 1).

The phosphoproteome of DeltabfiS biofilms as determined by LC - MS / MS was 74% similar ( 26% difference) to planktonic cells while DeltabfmR biofilms shared 60% of all detected phosphorylation events with planktonic cells ( 40% difference).

For instance, DeltabfiS and DeltabfmR biofilms lacked all phosphorylated proteins typically found in mature, 144 - hr - old biofilms.

In contrast, DeltabfmR biofilms were most similar to protein patterns obtained from 72 - hr - old wild type biofilms ( 85% similarity), while those of DeltamifR biofilms were similar to both 72 - and 144 - hr - old biofilms sharing 76 and 82% similarity, respectively, to both protein patterns ( Fig. 4B).

Inactivation of MifR appeared to result in the arrest of biofilm development in the transition between the maturation - 1 and - 2 stages ( 72 to 144 hr) while DeltabfmR biofilms were arrested in the transition between irreversible attachment to maturation - 1 stage.

However, biofilm development has been considered to be distinct from other developmental processes including the programmed differentiation seen in spore formation in Bacillus subtilis or fruiting body formation in Myxococcus xanthus [ 11], mainly because no regulatory pathways have yet been identified that are responsible for regulating committed steps in the formation of biofilms with the exception of attachment.

PhoP and MgtC are established virulence factors known to be important for survival of Y. pestis and other gram - negative bacteria in macrophages and for resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides ( CAMPs) of the mammalian innate immune response [ 38], [ 39], [ 40].

The PhoPQ system is induced in low Mg2 + or low pH environments, or by exposure to CAMPs [ 41], [ 42], [ 43].

The Mg2 + concentration and pH of the flea digestive tract have not been defined, so the inducing stimulus is unknown, but CAMPs are induced and secreted into the gut by blood feeding insects when they take a blood meal containing bacteria [ 44], [ 45].

X. cheopis fleas encode homologs of the insect CAMPs cecropin and defensin, and mount an inducible antibacterial response to infection ( unpublished data).

We previously reported that the genes for these Tc - like proteins are highly expressed in fleas, but that their products are nontoxic to fleas [ 49].

Coming from the flea, Y. pestis is also associated with the biofilm ECM, identical or closely related to the poly - beta - 1, 6 - N - acetyl glucosamine ECM of staphylococcal biofilms, which has been shown to provide protection from innate immune components [ 55], [ 56].

Besides degrading plasminogen, the Pla protease may also inactivate CAMPs, particularly when the F1 capsule is not present [ 57], which matches the phenotype of Y. pestis in the flea.

Increased resistance to innate immunity that is preinduced in the flea vector may be critical to productive transmission because blocked fleas transmit relatively few bacteria, often below the LD50 of Y. pestis grown in vitro at < 28degreesC [ 1], [ 52].

BvrS is a membrane - bound homodimeric protein that has three conserved regions frequently found in members of the histidine protein kinase superfamily: an amino - terminal periplasmic sensing domain with transmembrane segments, a cytoplasmic dimerisation domain with a specific His residue, and the carboxy - terminal ATP - binding kinase domain [ 5].

Although this general expression changes could explain the complete loss of virulence of these mutants, it was remarkable the presence among them of ten genes, in addition to bvrS, whose products are already known to be associated with Brucella virulence [ 10], [ 11], [ 33], [ 34].
