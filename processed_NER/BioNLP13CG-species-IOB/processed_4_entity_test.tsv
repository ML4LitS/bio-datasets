Various studies using the mouse, quail / chick, and frog have uncovered a number of signals that guide these complex processes but many gaps still exist in our understanding of the mechanisms by which the embryonic vasculature is built.

We used microdialysis to sample IL - 8 in normal human breast tissue in situ in pre - and postmenopausal women, preoperatively in breast cancers of women, and in experimental breast cancer in mice.

By introducing a cDNA library derived from rat embryonic fibroblast cells, we isolated several morphologically flat revertants of rat 3Y1 cells transformed by the E6 and E7 genes of human papillomavirus type 18 ( HPV18).
