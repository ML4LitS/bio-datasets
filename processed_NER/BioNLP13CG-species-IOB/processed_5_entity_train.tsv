The human T - cell leukemia viruses HTLV - I and HTLV - II are unique among the transforming retroviruses of vertebrates in their ability to transform human T cells in vitro and in their close association with human malignancies ( T - cell lymphomas and leukemia).

Chicken embryo fibroblasts and hamster BHK cells transformed by Rous sarcoma virus ( RSV) release in their culture media growth factors which enhance markedly anchorage - independent colony formation in gelified medium, at the restrictive temperature ( 41 degrees 5 C), of chicken embryo fibroblasts ( CEF) infected by RSV mutants with a ts mutation of the src gene.

To evaluate the concept that localized delivery of angiogenic factors via virus - mediated gene transfer may be useful in the treatment of ischemic disorders, the replication - deficient adenovirus ( Ad) vector AdCMV. VEGF165 ( where CMV is cytomegalovirus and VEGF is vascular endothelial growth factor) containing the cDNA for human VEGF165, a secreted endothelial cell - specific angiogenic growth factor, was constructed.
