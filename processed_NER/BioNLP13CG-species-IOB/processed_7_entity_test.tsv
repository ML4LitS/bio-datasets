Now, by competition experiments with a panel of different unlabelled cells we show that the VCSA expressed on RSV - transformed hamster fibroblasts is a complex of at least three distinct antigenic specificities: ( 1) one expressed on all RSV - transformed fibroblasts, regardless their species and the subgroup or strain of the transforming virus; ( 2) one cross - reacting with a cell - surface antigen ( CSA) expressed at various degrees on untransformed avian fibroblasts, but not on mammalian fibroblasts; ( 3) one species - specific, present only on RSV - transformed hamster fibroblasts.
