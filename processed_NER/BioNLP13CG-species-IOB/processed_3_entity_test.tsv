Many of the circulatory and transport properties of the sheep placenta are similar to those of the human placenta and as such, the pregnant sheep offers an excellent model in which to study the development of IUGR.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty - two MRI exams were performed with intravascular contrast media in 21 rats: tumours were induced by subcutaneous injection of colon carcinoma cells in 7 rats and mammary adenocarcinoma cells in 14 rats.

RESULTS: As regards the association of patients ' prognosis with EGFR staining and Ki - 67 index, a significant increase was observed in patients who died or had residual disease compared with patients who were alive without disease.

To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying compound - induced hemangiosarcomas in mice, and therefore, their human relevance, a systems biology approach was undertaken using transcriptomics and Causal Network Modeling from mice treated with 2 - butoxyethanol ( 2 - BE).

METHODS: Using human colon adenocarcinoma tissues ( hereinafter referred to as colon cancer) and their corresponding non - diseased colon from 114 patients ' biopsies, the expression of SPARC and vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) were investigated by immunohistochemistry staining to assessment the relationship between SPARC and VEGF, as well as their prognostic significance in patients.

The central region that is sufficient for these activities includes the evolutionarily highly conserved region among human, mouse and chicken c - fos proteins.
