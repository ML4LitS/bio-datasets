BACKGROUND: Patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa ( RDEB) have deficiencies of collagen type VII and have elevated levels of fibroblast collagenase, and a greatly increased risk of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.

The frequency of elevated bFGF values among all groups was statistically significant ( p = 0. 002), and the levels of bFGF in RDEB patients were significantly elevated compared with those of other groups ( p less than 0. 05).	patients,131,139,Organism	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
