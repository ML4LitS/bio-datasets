To this end, two candidate anti - angiogenic RNA - damaging agents, onconase and ( - 4) rhEDN, were screened for their effects on endothelial cell proliferation using three distinct types of endothelial cells in culture: HPV - 16 E6 / E7 - immortalized human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs), a Kras - transformed HPV - 16 E6 / E7 HUVEC ( Rhim et al., Carcinogenesis 4, 673 - 681, 1998), and primary HUVECs.

By means of intravital microscopy, tumor necrosis factor alpha - stimulated leukocyte - vessel wall interactions were studied in ear skin microvessels of nude mice bearing small human LS174T colon carcinomas and in C57Bl / 6 mice bearing murine B16F10 melanomas.

In this study, we determined the effectiveness of vasostatin delivered by recombinant pseudotype adeno - associated virus 2 / 5 ( rAAV2 / 5 - VAS) as a gene therapy approach for lung cancer treatment.

CONCLUSION: Our results show the effectiveness of rAAV2 / 5 - VAS as an angiogenesis inhibitor in suppressing tumor growth during different stages of tumor progression, validating the application of rAAV2 / 5 - VAS gene therapy in treatment against lung cancer.

We have established a model system to detect the presence of ras p21 in the sera of Balb / c mice carrying tumors induced by a mouse cell line transformed with the Harvey murine sarcoma virus in the presence of a helper Friend murine leukemia virus.
