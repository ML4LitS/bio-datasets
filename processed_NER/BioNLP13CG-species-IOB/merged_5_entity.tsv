The human T - cell leukemia viruses HTLV - I and HTLV - II are unique among the transforming retroviruses of vertebrates in their ability to transform human T cells in vitro and in their close association with human malignancies ( T - cell lymphomas and leukemia).	human T - cell leukemia viruses HTLV - I,4,44,Organism	HTLV - II,49,58,Organism	retroviruses,93,105,Organism	human,151,156,Organism	human,210,215,Organism	"[{""token"": ""human T - cell leukemia viruses HTLV - I"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""HTLV - II"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""retroviruses"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 151, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 210, ""end_span"": 215, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	train
Chicken embryo fibroblasts and hamster BHK cells transformed by Rous sarcoma virus ( RSV) release in their culture media growth factors which enhance markedly anchorage - independent colony formation in gelified medium, at the restrictive temperature ( 41 degrees 5 C), of chicken embryo fibroblasts ( CEF) infected by RSV mutants with a ts mutation of the src gene.

To evaluate the concept that localized delivery of angiogenic factors via virus - mediated gene transfer may be useful in the treatment of ischemic disorders, the replication - deficient adenovirus ( Ad) vector AdCMV. VEGF165 ( where CMV is cytomegalovirus and VEGF is vascular endothelial growth factor) containing the cDNA for human VEGF165, a secreted endothelial cell - specific angiogenic growth factor, was constructed.	adenovirus,187,197,Organism	Ad,200,202,Organism	CMV,213,216,Organism	cytomegalovirus,241,256,Organism	human,329,334,Organism	"[{""token"": ""adenovirus"", ""start_span"": 187, ""end_span"": 197, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Ad"", ""start_span"": 200, ""end_span"": 202, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""CMV"", ""start_span"": 213, ""end_span"": 216, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""cytomegalovirus"", ""start_span"": 241, ""end_span"": 256, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 329, ""end_span"": 334, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	train
Hepatitis B virus ( HBV) is strongly associated with the development of HCC in people chronically infected with the virus, but the mechanism of viral involvement remains unclear.
