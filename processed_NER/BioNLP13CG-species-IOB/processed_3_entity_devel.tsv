The mammalian proto - oncogene Cbl and its cellular homologues in Caenorhabditis elegans ( Sli - 1) and Drosophila ( D - Cbl) are negative regulators of some growth factor receptor signaling pathways.

We have modelled multiple stages of malignant transformation of human endothelial cells ( ECs) by overexpressing the catalytic subunit of human telomerase ( hTERT), together with SV40 T antigen ( SV40T) and oncogenic N - ras.

Transgenic mice engineered to express human endosialin bred on an immunocompromised background allowed the growth of human tumor xenografts.

In human colon carcinoma Colo205 and HT29 xenografts grown in human endosialin - transgenic mice, endosialin expression was largely confined to NG2 - expressing perivascular cells and not CD31 - positive endothelial cells.

In a mouse model of endotoxemia, DSCR - 1s - deficient mice demonstrated increased sepsis mortality, whereas adenovirus - mediated DSCR - 1s overexpression protected against LPS - induced lethality.

Here we characterized the effects of mutant CK1delta variants with impaired kinase activity on SV40 - induced cell transformation in vitro, and on SV40 - induced mammary carcinogenesis in vivo in a transgenic / bi - transgenic mouse model.

To characterize the effects of CK1delta on SV40 - induced mammary carcinogenesis, we generated transgenic mice expressing mutant CK1delta under the control of the whey acidic protein ( WAP) gene promoter, and crossed them with SV40 transgenic WAP - T - antigen ( WAP - T) mice.

However, by treatment with Ha - ras oncogenes derived from a human lung carcinoma or Harvey murine sarcoma virus, the KMST - 6 cells acquired elevated clonability in soft agar and transplantability in nude mice.

Since other DNA tumor viruses, such as simian virus 40 and adenovirus, have previously been shown to interact with cellular protein p53, we investigated whether infection of cells by HCMV would modulate cellular p53 levels.

HCMV immediate - early proteins were clearly shown to be responsible for elevating p53 levels in infected fibroblasts; expression of HCMV immediate - early region 1 and 2 proteins resulted in elevation of p53 levels in transfected human fibroblasts.
