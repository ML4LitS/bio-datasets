BACKGROUND: We suggest that surgical extirpation of primary breast cancer among other effects accelerates relapse for some premenopausal node - positive patients.	"patients	153	161	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

We could imagine that it also plays a role in adjuvant chemotherapy effectiveness since, perhaps not coincidentally, this is most beneficial for premenopausal node - positive patients.	"patients	175	183	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 183, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
HYPOTHESIS: We speculate that there is a burst of angiogenesis of distant dormant micrometastases after surgery in approximately 20% of premenopausal node - positive patients.	"patients	166	174	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 166, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We also speculate that this synchronizes them into a temporal highly chemosensitive state and is the underlying reason why adjuvant chemotherapy works particularly well for that patient category.
