The adenovirus type 5 55 - kDa E1B protein ( E1B - 55kDa) cooperates with E1A gene products to induce cell transformation.	"adenovirus type 5	4	21	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""adenovirus type 5"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We demonstrate directly that the wild - type 55 - kDa protein is able to block E1A - induced p53 - dependent apoptosis, whereas cells infected by mutant pm490 / 1 / 5A, which contains alanine residues at all three phosphorylation sites, exhibited extensive DNA fragmentation and classic apoptotic cell death.

[ Expression of metastasis suppressor gene nm23 in human hepatocellular carcinoma].	"human	51	56	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
For the purpose of investigating the relationship between the metastatic potential of the tumor as well as the expression of nm23 - H1 mRNA, and for determing the location of the positive sites in the cells, tumor metastasis suppressor gene nm23 - H1 in human hepatocellular carcinoma ( and the nonneoplastic area surrounding the tumor) was detected by in situ hybridization using digoxiginin - labeled nm23 - H1 antisense complementary RNA probe.	"human	254	259	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 254, ""end_span"": 259, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The primary results indicated ( i) positive results of in situ hybridization are presence of granules or masses in the cytoplasm; ( ii) the less expression of nm23 - H1 mRNA, the higher metastatic rate of the human hepatocellular carcinoma ( P < 0. 05); ( iii) expression of nm23 - H1 mRNA dose not correlate with some other factors such as tumor size and the background of other liver diseases.

BACKGROUND: The fate of patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia of type II A ( MEN II A) is determined by medullary thyroid carcinoma, which occurs in all cases.	"patients	24	32	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with MEN II A ( aged 4 - 24 years) who had undergone prophylactic thyroidectomy since 1990 were included in the study.	"patients	30	38	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""patients"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

RESULTS: Histology demonstrated C - cell hyperplasia in five patients ( aged 4 - 13 years), unilateral medullary microcarcinoma in six ( aged 9 - 17 years) and a bilateral medullary microcarcinoma in three cases ( aged 17 - 24 years).

CONCLUSION: In MEN II A patients undergoing prophylactic thyroidectomy, baseline but not stimulated calcitonin levels already correlate with the histologic tumor stage at the stage of clinically occult C - cell hyperplasia or medullary microcarcinoma.
