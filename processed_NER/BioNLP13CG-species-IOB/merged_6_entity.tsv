This restriction enzyme site polymorphism along with the sequence variations were also observed in 50 biopsy tissues as well as in the throat washings of 6 out of 20 healthy individuals that we examined, indicating that the EBV strain predominantly existing in these biopsy tissues was different from strains of B95 - 8, Jijoye or nude mouse passaged cells ( C15) with an African origin, but closely resembled other nude mouse passaged CAO cells which were originally derived from China.	individuals,174,185,Organism	EBV,224,227,Organism	B95 - 8,312,319,Organism	Jijoye,321,327,Organism	nude mouse,331,341,Organism	nude mouse,416,426,Organism	"[{""token"": ""individuals"", ""start_span"": 174, ""end_span"": 185, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""EBV"", ""start_span"": 224, ""end_span"": 227, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""B95 - 8"", ""start_span"": 312, ""end_span"": 319, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Jijoye"", ""start_span"": 321, ""end_span"": 327, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""nude mouse"", ""start_span"": 331, ""end_span"": 341, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""nude mouse"", ""start_span"": 416, ""end_span"": 426, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	valid
