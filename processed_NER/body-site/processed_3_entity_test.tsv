The inflammatory cells may extend into submucosa, smooth muscle and serosal layer.

Briefly, the luminal contents were separately gathered from the middle section of the colon and the ileum.

( B and C) Linear strips of gastric tissue, extending from the squamocolumnar junction to the proximal duodenum, were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin.

Three biopsies were obtained from the greater curvature sides of the mid - antrum and mid - body, in addition to the descending duodenum.
