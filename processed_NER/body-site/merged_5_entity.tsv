The percent GI damage was calculated by first measuring the linear length of the colon with damaged epithelial integrity using the pen tool in ScanScope ( Aperio Technologies) on colon segments stained for claudin - 3 and dividing this value by the measured linear length of the entire colon segments in each tissue section (% damage = ( damaged GI tract length / total GI tract length) 100).	colon,81,86,body-site	colon,179,184,body-site	colon,286,291,body-site	GI tract,346,354,body-site	GI tract,370,378,body-site	"[{""token"": ""colon"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""body-site""}, {""token"": ""colon"", ""start_span"": 179, ""end_span"": 184, ""type"": ""body-site""}, {""token"": ""colon"", ""start_span"": 286, ""end_span"": 291, ""type"": ""body-site""}, {""token"": ""GI tract"", ""start_span"": 346, ""end_span"": 354, ""type"": ""body-site""}, {""token"": ""GI tract"", ""start_span"": 370, ""end_span"": 378, ""type"": ""body-site""}]"	train
