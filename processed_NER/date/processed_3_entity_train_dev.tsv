At the steady - state period, three samples ( C4, D5 and E8) were collected on days 140 ( 13 January 2016), 162 ( 23 March 2016) and 190 ( 20 April 2016), respectively.

Samples were pooled in order to obtain sufficient DNA for each respective sequencing library; for 16S rRNA gene amplicon analysis, subsamples collected on 26 June ( 01: 00 PDT) and 27 June ( 16: 00 PDT) were pooled ( 250 m total depth resolution) and for metagenome sequencing subsamples collected on 26 June ( 16: 00 PDT) were combined ( 1 mm total depth resolution for a total of five metagenome libraries).
