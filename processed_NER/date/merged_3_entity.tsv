When the AnMBR faced hydraulic overloading due to the technical failure, one sample ( F10) was collected on day 210 ( 29 April 2016), and after twenty days later on day 230 ( 21 May 2016), a second sample ( J15) was collected to further understand this phenomenon, as a new inoculum ( Seed 2) was used on the day 220 ( 10 May 2016) to prevent the AnMBR process from failing.	29 April 2016,118,131,date	21 May 2016,175,186,date	10 May 2016,319,330,date	"[{""token"": ""29 April 2016"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""date""}, {""token"": ""21 May 2016"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 186, ""type"": ""date""}, {""token"": ""10 May 2016"", ""start_span"": 319, ""end_span"": 330, ""type"": ""date""}]"	test
At the steady - state period, three samples ( C4, D5 and E8) were collected on days 140 ( 13 January 2016), 162 ( 23 March 2016) and 190 ( 20 April 2016), respectively.	13 January 2016,90,105,date	23 March 2016,114,127,date	20 April 2016,139,152,date	"[{""token"": ""13 January 2016"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""date""}, {""token"": ""23 March 2016"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""date""}, {""token"": ""20 April 2016"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""date""}]"	train
Samples were pooled in order to obtain sufficient DNA for each respective sequencing library; for 16S rRNA gene amplicon analysis, subsamples collected on 26 June ( 01: 00 PDT) and 27 June ( 16: 00 PDT) were pooled ( 250 m total depth resolution) and for metagenome sequencing subsamples collected on 26 June ( 16: 00 PDT) were combined ( 1 mm total depth resolution for a total of five metagenome libraries).	26 June,155,162,date	27 June,181,188,date	26 June,301,308,date	"[{""token"": ""26 June"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 162, ""type"": ""date""}, {""token"": ""27 June"", ""start_span"": 181, ""end_span"": 188, ""type"": ""date""}, {""token"": ""26 June"", ""start_span"": 301, ""end_span"": 308, ""type"": ""date""}]"	train
