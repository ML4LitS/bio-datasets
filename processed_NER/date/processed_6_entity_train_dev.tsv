DNA Extraction DNA was extracted from filters collected in March, May, June, August, September, and November using a phenol - chloroform method described previously ( Bagnoud et al., 2016) with the following modifications; ( 1) filter pieces were subject to bead - beating ( 2 15 s) prior to incubation in lysozyme for 2 h at 37C; ( 2) lysate was incubated in Proteinase K ( 200 g / mL final concentration) for 2 h. DNA was quantified on a Qubit 3. 0 Fluorometer using the Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay kit ( Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.).
