When the AnMBR faced hydraulic overloading due to the technical failure, one sample ( F10) was collected on day 210 ( 29 April 2016), and after twenty days later on day 230 ( 21 May 2016), a second sample ( J15) was collected to further understand this phenomenon, as a new inoculum ( Seed 2) was used on the day 220 ( 10 May 2016) to prevent the AnMBR process from failing.
