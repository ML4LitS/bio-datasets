Overall, field evidence suggests that hyperalkaline seepages are numerous and are active late in the baseflow period of perennial streams ( December to April).

MATERIALS AND METHODS Sampling and physiochemical measurements Benthic mat samples were collected on 26 June 2012 at 16: 00 PDT ( photon flux 490 mol photons PAR m2 s1; due to partial cloudiness) and 27 June 2012 at 01: 00 PDT ( photon flux 0 mol photons PAR m2 s1) and at 16: 00 PDT ( photon flux 1225 mol photon PAR m2 s1) from a water depth of 3540cm located in northeastern Washington state ( USA) ( 48. 97347119. 476322).
