Twelve infants received antibiotics already during the first week of life, while five additional infants started antibiotic treatment during the second week.

In order to construct and validate microbial relationships, we first induce a community shift from simple to complex by manipulating artificial hibernation ( AH) in the treefrog Polypedates megacephalus.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Patient cohort This is a metataxonomic sequencing analysis of a subsample of 41 patients from the already published clinical investigation of Harks etal10 registered at Clinical Trials. gov ( NCT02697539).

Turkestan cockroach nymphs ( Finke, 2013) were fed to the treefrogs at a quantity of 10% of treefrog biomass twice a week.
