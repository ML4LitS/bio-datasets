Subsequent studies have revealed that ( i) cytoplasmic RelA is stably associated not only with I kappa B alpha but also with other ankyrin motif - rich proteins including the products of the NF - kappa B2 ( p100) and NF - kappa B1 ( p105) genes; ( ii) in contrast to RelA - I kappa B alpha, RelA - p100 cytoplasmic complexes are not dissociated following tumor necrosis factor alpha activation; ( iii) p100 functions as a potent inhibitor of RelA - mediated transcription in vivo; ( iv) the interaction of RelA and p100 involves the conserved Rel homology domain of both proteins but not the nuclear localization signal of RelA, which is required for I kappa B alpha binding; ( v) p100 inhibition of RelA function requires the C - terminal ankyrin motif domain, which mediates cytoplasmic retention of RelA; and ( vi) as observed with I kappa B alpha, nuclear RelA stimulates p100 mRNA and protein expression.	cytoplasmic RelA,43,59,Gene/Protein	I kappa B alpha,95,110,Gene/Protein	ankyrin motif - rich proteins,131,160,Gene/Protein	RelA,267,271,Gene/Protein	- I kappa B alpha,272,289,Gene/Protein	RelA - p100 cytoplasmic complexes,291,324,Gene/Protein	tumor necrosis factor alpha,355,382,Gene/Protein	p100,402,406,Gene/Protein	RelA,442,446,Gene/Protein	RelA,506,510,Gene/Protein	p100,515,519,Gene/Protein	conserved Rel homology domain,533,562,Gene/Protein	nuclear localization signal,592,619,Gene/Protein	RelA,623,627,Gene/Protein	I kappa B alpha,651,666,Gene/Protein	p100,681,685,Gene/Protein	RelA,700,704,Gene/Protein	C - terminal ankyrin motif domain,727,760,Gene/Protein	RelA,802,806,Gene/Protein	I kappa B alpha,835,850,Gene/Protein	RelA,860,864,Gene/Protein	p100 mRNA,876,885,Gene/Protein	"[{""token"": ""cytoplasmic RelA"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""I kappa B alpha"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""ankyrin motif - rich proteins"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 160, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""RelA"", ""start_span"": 267, ""end_span"": 271, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""- I kappa B alpha"", ""start_span"": 272, ""end_span"": 289, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""RelA - p100 cytoplasmic complexes"", ""start_span"": 291, ""end_span"": 324, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""tumor necrosis factor alpha"", ""start_span"": 355, ""end_span"": 382, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""p100"", ""start_span"": 402, ""end_span"": 406, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""RelA"", ""start_span"": 442, ""end_span"": 446, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""RelA"", ""start_span"": 506, ""end_span"": 510, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""p100"", ""start_span"": 515, ""end_span"": 519, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""conserved Rel homology domain"", ""start_span"": 533, ""end_span"": 562, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""nuclear localization signal"", ""start_span"": 592, ""end_span"": 619, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""RelA"", ""start_span"": 623, ""end_span"": 627, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""I kappa B alpha"", ""start_span"": 651, ""end_span"": 666, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""p100"", ""start_span"": 681, ""end_span"": 685, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""RelA"", ""start_span"": 700, ""end_span"": 704, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""C - terminal ankyrin motif domain"", ""start_span"": 727, ""end_span"": 760, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""RelA"", ""start_span"": 802, ""end_span"": 806, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""I kappa B alpha"", ""start_span"": 835, ""end_span"": 850, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""RelA"", ""start_span"": 860, ""end_span"": 864, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""p100 mRNA"", ""start_span"": 876, ""end_span"": 885, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"	train
