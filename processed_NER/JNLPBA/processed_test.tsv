NF - A1 is present in a variety of cell types, whereas the presence of NF - A2 is essentially confined to B cells, leading to the hypothesis that NF - A2 activates cell - type - specific transcription of the Ig promoter and NF - A1 mediates the other responses of the OCTA element.

This suggests that the constitutive OCTA - binding factor NF - A1 can activate transcription of the Ig promoter and that B - cell - specific transcription of this promoter, at least in vitro, is partially due to a quantitative difference in the amount of OCTA - binding protein.

A patient with the syndrome of glucocorticoid resistance was studied.	[]
A 27 - yr - old woman initially was diagnosed as having Cushing ' s disease, based on the findings of high plasma ACTH and serum cortisol levels, increased urinary cortisol secretion, resistance to adrenal suppression with dexamethasone, and bilateral adrenal hyperplasia by computed tomography and scintigraphy of the adrenal glands.

However, she had no signs or symptoms of Cushing ' s syndrome.	[]
During a 5 - yr follow - up, no clinical abnormalities developed, although hypercortisolism persisted.	[]
End - organ resistance to cortisol was suspected.	[]
To explain the end - organ resistance to cortisol, the glucocorticoid receptors ( GR) in peripheral mononuclear leukocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts from a forearm skin biopsy were characterized and compared with the results of similar studies in normal subjects.

Sensitive and receptor - mediated regulation by 1, 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D3 in normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes.	[]

The regulation of GM - CSF expression is seen in both normal human mitogen - activated T lymphocytes and T lymphocytes from a line ( S - LB1) transformed with human T cell lymphotropic virus 1 ( HTLV - 1).	"GM - CSF	18	26	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GM - CSF"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In contrast, cells from a HTLV - 1 transformed T lymphocyte line ( Ab - VDR) established from a patient with vitamin D - resistant rickets type II with undetectable 1, 25 ( OH) 2D3 cellular receptors are resistant to the action of 1, 25 ( OH) 2D3.	[]
Inhibition of GM - CSF expression by 1, 25 ( OH) 2D3 can occur independently of interleukin 2 regulation and is probably mediated through cellular 1, 25 ( OH) 2D3 receptors.

Altered interaction between triiodothyronine and its nuclear receptors in absence of cortisol: a proposed mechanism for increased thyrotropin secretion in corticosteroid deficiency states.	"nuclear receptors	53	70	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""nuclear receptors"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Thyroid hormones occasionally appear less effective when administered alone to patients with panhypopituitarism, and manifestations suggestive of hypothyroidism have been reported in patients suffering from untreated Addison ' s disease.	[]
In the latter condition, thyrotropin secretion is increased: this occurs already after as little as 2 days of temporary withdrawal of therapy with substitution doses of corticosteroids while circulating levels of thyroid hormones remain within normal limits.	[]
Therefore, a possible role of cortisol in interaction between triiodothyronine and its nuclear receptors was examined at the level of circulating lymphocytes obtained from patients with primary or secondary adrenocortical failure.	"nuclear receptors	87	104	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""nuclear receptors"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The affinity of these receptors was found to be decreased, by more than 50% on average, in the absence of cortisol treatments.	[]
This change was promptly corrected upon resumption of therapy.	[]
The number of binding sites was not significantly modified.	[]
The influence of cortisol on thyroid hormone receptors discussed here might account for the clinical observations mentioned above.	"thyroid hormone receptors	29	54	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""thyroid hormone receptors"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Inhibition by cortisol of human natural killer ( NK) cell activity.	[]
The effects of cortisol on the natural killer ( NK) activity of human peripheral blood mononuclear ( PBM) cells were studied in vitro using a direct 4 - h 51Cr - release assay and K 562 cell line as a target.	[]
Preincubation for 20 h of PBM cells drawn from healthy donors with 1 X 10 ( - 8) to 1 X 10 ( - 5) M cortisol resulted in a significant decrease of NK cell activity.	[]
The magnitude of the suppression was directly related to the steroid concentration and inversely related to the number of effector cells.	[]
Cortisol was able to minimize the enhancement of NK cytotoxicity obtainable in the presence of immune interferon ( IFN - gamma).	[]
A significantly higher suppression was achieved after sequential exposure of PBM cells to cortisol and equimolar levels of prostaglandin E2 ( PgE2).	[]
The concomitant incubation with theophylline and isobutyl - methylxanthine failed to enhance the cortisol - induced suppression, whereas PgE2 - dependent inhibition significantly increased after exposure of PBM cells to methyl - xanthines.	[]
The inhibitory effect of cortisol was partially or totally prevented by the concomitant incubation with equimolar amounts of 11 - deoxycortisol and RU 486 but not of progesterone.	[]
Treatment of NK effectors with a monoclonal anti - human corticosteroid - binding globulin ( CBG) antibody produced an enhancement of the spontaneous NK activity and a partial suppression of cortisol - mediated effects.	[]
Our results suggest that endogenous glucocorticoids play a role in the regulation of NK cell - mediated cytotoxicity.	[]
Since the effect of cortisol was additive to that of PgE2 and was not changed by phosphodiesterase inhibitors, it is conceivable that the hormone acts at a level different from the adenylate cyclase - phosphodiesterase system.

The new world primates as animal models of glucocorticoid resistance.	[]
Many New World primate species have greatly increased plasma cortisol concentrations, decreased plasma cortisol binding globulin capacity and affinity, marked resistance of the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal axis to suppression by dexamethasone, and no biological evidence of glucocorticoid excess.	[]
These primates also have high levels of circulating progesterone, estrogen, mineralocorticoid, androgen and vitamin D.	[]
The glucocorticoid target tissues that have been examined ( circulating mononuclear lymphocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts) have normal concentrations of glucocorticoid receptors with decreased affinity for dexamethasone.

The receptor in these cells has a low affinity for dexamethasone.	[]
The low affinity leads to an increased loss of specific bound ligand during thermal activation.	[]
Meroreceptor generation is normal.	[]
The molecular weight of the receptor, determined by SDS - PAGE, is similar to that of Old World primates ( approximately 92, 000) and the activation pattern per se, examined in vitro by heating cytosol and performing phosphocellulose chromatography, appears similar to that of human controls.	[]
The ratios of nuclear to cytosolic hormone - receptor - complexes and of cytosolic activated to unactivated receptor complexes in intact cells are similar to Old World primates.

Results from mixing studies do not support the hypothesis that a binding inhibitor ( s) or a deficient cytosolic positive modifier ( s) of binding underlies the findings in these primates.	[]
The New World primates, unlike men with the syndrome of primary cortisol resistance, have compensated for their condition with intra - adrenal and mineralocorticoid receptor adaptations.	[]
Thus, unlike Old World primates, cortisol in New World primates has only weak sodium - retaining potency because the aldosterone receptor has a low affinity for cortisol.

Eight patients in long - term ( LT; 3 to 15 years) and 15 patients in short - term ( ST; up to 3 years) remission were studied.	[]

Although all MRD - positive patients in LT remission are still until now event - free, 3 of the 7 MRD - positive ( MRD +) patients in ST remission soon relapsed.	[]
The total populations of CD4 +, CD8 + and CD56 + [ possible T - cell and natural killer ( T / NK) populations] in the BM of ST patients and MRD + / LT patients were significantly ( p <. 01) low.

The CD8 + CD28 + population showed the same tendency ( p <. 01 -. 02).	[]
The T / NK subsets in the BM of MRD - negative ( MRD -) LT ( MRD - / LT) patients showed similar numbers of cells as normal volunteers.	[]
Basically, the total percentage of the CD4 +, CD8 + and CD56 + cell populations in the BM was increased and in the following order: MRD - / LT patients, normal volunteers, MRD + / LT patients and MRD + or - / ST patients.	[]
The percentages of the T / NK - cell subsets in the PB were not significantly different among these groups.	[]
Thus, the difference of the possible T / NK - cell phenotype in the BM may strongly influence clinical and molecular remission.	[]
These results still remain to be confirmed by further studies of the functional anti - tumor immunity of T / NK cells of AML in remission.	[]

Tuberculosis has emerged as an epidemic, extended by the large number of individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV - 1).	[]
The major goal of this study was to determine whether the mycobacterial cell wall component mannose - capped lipoarabinomannan ( ManLAM) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M. tuberculosis) could activate transcription of HIV - 1 in T cells with the use of an in vitro cell culture system.	[]

Using the 1G5 cell line harbouring the luciferase reporter gene under the control of the HIV - 1 LTR, it was first found that culture protein filtrates ( CFP) from M. tuberculosis or purified ManLAM could activate HIV - 1 LTR - dependent gene expression unlike similarly prepared CFP extracts devoid of ManLAM.

Among several known transcription factor binding motifs, nuclear protein ( s) of VD3 - treated HL - 60 cells and THP - 1 cells bound to the CCAAT / enhancer binding protein ( C / EBP) - binding motif that was located in the upstream region of the MRP14 gene ( - 81), as evidenced by the competitive gel mobility - shift assay.

An antibody for C / EBP alpha super - shifted the nucleoprotein complex in THP - 1 cells but not in the VD3 - treated HL - 60 cells, whereas an antibody for C / EBP beta blocked the formation of the complex with the nuclear factor of the HL - 60 cells but not with that of THP - 1 cells.

Thus, it was concluded that C / EBP alpha and - beta were able to bind to the C / EBP motif, and that C / EBP alpha bound to the motif in THP - 1 cells and C / EBP beta bound to that in the VD3 - treated HL - 60 cells.

Furthermore, to examine the transcriptional activity of the C / EBP motif, we transfected several constructed luciferase reporter DNAs into HL - 60 cells and THP - 1 cells.

The luciferase activity of the C / EBP motif in HL - 60 cells was increased by VD3 treatment.	"C / EBP motif	31	44	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""C / EBP motif"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The C / EBP motif in the MRP14 gene was confirmed to function as a regulatory region in VD3 - treated HL - 60 cells and THP - 1 cells by the assay.

Patients with high - risk myelodysplastic syndrome can have polyclonal or clonal haemopoiesis in complete haematological remission.	[]
The clonality of mature peripheral blood - derived myeloid and lymphoid cells and bone marrow haemopoietic progenitors from 18 females with myelodysplasia ( MDS) ( five refractory anaemia, RA; one RA with ringed sideroblasts, RARS; three chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia, CMML; four RA with excess of blasts, RAEB; five RAEB in transformation, RAEB - t) was studied by X - chromosome inactivation analysis.	"X - chromosome	369	383	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""X - chromosome"", ""start_span"": 369, ""end_span"": 383, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Using the human androgen - receptor ( HUMARA) assay, we analysed the clonal patterns of highly purified immature CD34 + 38 - and committed CD34 + 38 + marrow - derived progenitors, and CD16 + 14 - granulocytes, CD14 + monocytes, CD3 + T and CD19 + B lymphocytes from peripheral blood.	[]
In high - risk patients ( RAEB, RAEB - t), clonality analysis was performed before and after intensive remission - induction treatment.	[]
All patients, except one with RA, had predominance of a single clone in their granulocytes and monocytes.	[]
The same clonal pattern was found in CD34 + progenitor cells.	[]
In contrast, CD3 + T lymphocytes were polyclonal or oligoclonal in 14 / 18 patients.	[]
X - chromosome inactivation patterns of CD19 + B cells were highly concordant with CD3 + T cells except for two patients ( one RA, one CMML) with monoclonal B and polyclonal T lymphocytes, therefore suggesting a clonal mutation in a progenitor common to the myeloid and B - lymphoid lineages or the coexistence of MDS and a B - cell disorder in these particular patients.	"X - chromosome	0	14	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""X - chromosome"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
After high - dose non - myeloablative chemotherapy, polyclonal haemopoiesis was reinstalled in the mature myeloid cells and immature and committed marrow progenitors in three of four patients achieving complete haematological remission.	[]
Therefore we conclude that most haematological remissions in MDS are associated with restoration of polyclonal haemopoiesis.	[]

This arrest is manifested at a molecular level as a reduction in mRNA levels of secretory immunoglobulin gene products such as mu ( s) and J chain as well as the loss of the transcriptional regulator BLIMP - 1.

A positively charged alpha - lipoic acid analogue with increased cellular uptake and more potent immunomodulatory activity.	[]
alpha - Lipoic acid ( LA) is taken up by cells and reduced to its potent dithiol form, dihydrolipoate ( DHLA), much of which is rapidly effluxed out from cells.	[]

OBJECTIVE: Carrier identification in X - linked immunodeficiency disorders can be based on the demonstration of non - random X inactivation ( NRXI) in affected blood cell lineages when growth is impaired in cells expressing the abnormal gene.	"abnormal gene	228	241	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""abnormal gene"", ""start_span"": 228, ""end_span"": 241, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
We examined the utility of seeking evidence of NRXI to test the carrier status of women in families affected by X - linked severe combined immunodeficiency ( XSCID) and X - linked hypogammaglobulinaem ( XLH), to identify as carriers the mothers of boys with SCID or hypogammaglobulinaem whose phenotype suggested X - linkage and to infer X - linkage in boys with SCID or hypogammaglobulinaem whose disease was not clearly X - linked on the basis either of family history or clinical and immunological characteristics.	[]
METHODOLOGY: A polymerase chain reaction - based method was used to amplify a polymorphic CAG repeat in the first exon of the androgen receptor gene after selective digestion of the active X chromosome with a methylation - sensitive enzyme, HpaII to distinguish between the paternal and maternal alleles and to identify their methylation status.

RESULTS: Heterozygosity was found in 24 of 31 female subjects ( 77%).	[]
As anticipated, NRXI could be demonstrated in all lymphoid cells studied from obligate carriers of XSCID and an obligate carrier of XLH but not on a carrier of X - linked immunodeficiency with hyper - IgM.	"hyper - IgM	193	204	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""hyper - IgM"", ""start_span"": 193, ""end_span"": 204, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The finding of NRXI in the mother of a boy with a SCID variant showed her to be a carrier of XSCID and establishes that her son has XSCID, not otherwise evident from available data.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: This PCR assay provides a rapid method for carrier detection of X - linked immunodeficiencies, and has allowed us to expand the phenotype of XSCID	[]
Leukocyte - endothelial interaction is augmented by high glucose concentrations and hyperglycemia in a NF - kB - dependent fashion.	[]
We addressed the role of hyperglycemia in leukocyte - endothelium interaction under flow conditions by exposing human umbilical vein endothelial cells for 24 h to normal ( 5 mM), high concentration of glucose ( 30 mM), advanced glycosylation end product - albumin ( 100 microg / ml), or hyperglycemic ( 174 - 316 mg / dl) sera from patients with diabetes and abnormal hemoglobin A1c ( 8. 1 + / - 1. 4%).	"product - albumin	246	263	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""product - albumin"", ""start_span"": 246, ""end_span"": 263, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
At the end of incubation endothelial cells were perfused with total leukocyte suspension in a parallel plate flow chamber under laminar flow ( 1. 5 dyn / cm2).	[]
Rolling and adherent cells were evaluated by digital image processing.	[]
Results showed that 30 mM glucose significantly ( P < 0. 01) increased the number of adherent leukocytes to endothelial cells in respect to control ( 5 mM glucose; 151 + / - 19 versus 33 + / - 8 cells / mm2).	[]
A similar response was induced by endothelial stimulation with IL - 1beta, here used as positive control ( 195 + / - 20 cells / mm2).	"IL - 1beta	63	73	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 1beta"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The number of rolling cells on endothelial surface was not affected by high glucose level.	[]
Stable adhesion of leukocytes to glucose - treated as well as to IL - 1beta - stimulated endothelial cells was preceded by short interaction of leukocytes with the endothelial surface.	[]
The distance travelled by leukocytes before arrest on 30 mM glucose, or on IL - 1beta - treated endothelial cells, was significantly ( P < 0. 01) higher than that observed for leukocytes adhering on control endothelium ( 30 mM glucose: 76. 7 + / - 3. 5; IL1beta: 69. 7 + / - 4 versus 5 mM glucose: 21. 5 + / - 5 microm).	[]
Functional blocking of E - selectin, intercellular cell adhesion molecule - 1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule - 1 on endothelial cells with the corresponding mouse mAb significantly inhibited glucose - induced increase in leukocyte adhesion ( 67 + / - 16, 83 + / - 12, 62 + / - 8 versus 144 + / - 21 cells / mm2).

Confocal fluorescence microscopy studies showed that 30 mM glucose induced an increase in endothelial surface expression of E - selectin, intercellular cell adhesion molecule - 1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule - 1.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay of nuclear extracts of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC) exposed for 1 h to 30 mM glucose revealed an intense NF - kB activation.

Treatment of HUVEC exposed to high glucose with the NF - kB inhibitors pyrrolidinedithiocar ( 100 microM) and tosyl - phe - chloromethylketone ( 25 microM) significantly reduced ( P < 0. 05) leukocyte adhesion in respect to HUVEC treated with glucose alone.	"NF - kB inhibitors	52	70	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NF - kB inhibitors"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
A significant ( P < 0. 01) inhibitory effect on glucose - induced leukocyte adhesion was observed after blocking protein kinase C activity with staurosporine ( 5 nM).	"protein kinase C	113	129	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""protein kinase C"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
When HUVEC were treated with specific antisense oligodesoxynucleotid against PKCalpha and PKCepsilon isoforms before the addition of 30 mM glucose, a significant ( P < 0. 05) reduction in the adhesion was also seen.

Advanced glycosylation end product - albumin significantly increased the number of adhering leukocytes in respect to native albumin used as control ( 110 + / - 16 versus 66 + / - 7, P < 0. 01).

Sera from diabetic patients significantly ( P < 0. 01) enhanced leukocyte adhesion as compared with controls, despite normal levels of IL - 1beta and TNFalpha in these sera.	"IL - 1beta	135	145	Gene/Protein"	"TNFalpha	150	158	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 1beta"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
These data indicate that high glucose concentration and hyperglycemia promote leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium through upregulation of cell surface expression of adhesive proteins, possibly depending on NF - kB activation.

Studies on the molecular mechanisms that control hemopoietic differentiation have focused on signaling cascades and nuclear effectors that drive this complex developmental system in a regulated fashion.	[]
Here we review the role of Ikaros, the founding member of a unique family of zinc finger transcription factors in this developmental process.

Studies on an Ikaros null mutation have revealed an essential role for this factor in lymphoid cell fate determination and at subsequent branch points of the T cell differentiation pathway.

The transcription factors encoded by the E2A and early B cell factor ( EBF) genes are required for the proper development of B lymphocytes.	"transcription factors	4	25	Gene/Protein"	"E2A	41	44	Gene/Protein"	"early B cell factor	49	68	Gene/Protein"	"EBF	71	74	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""transcription factors"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""E2A"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""early B cell factor"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""EBF"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
However, the absence of B lineage cells in E2A - and EBF - deficient mice has made it difficult to determine the function or relationship between these proteins.	[]
We report the identification of a novel model system in which the role of E2A and EBF in the regulation of multiple B lineage traits can be studied.

We found that the conversion of 70Z / 3 pre - B lymphocytes to cells with a macrophage - like phenotype is associated with the loss of E2A and EBF.

Moreover, we show that ectopic expression of the E2A protein E12 in this macrophage line results in the induction of many B lineage genes, including EBF, IL7Ralpha, lambda5, and Rag - 1, and the ability to induce kappa light chain in response to mitogen.

Activation of EBF may be one of the critical functions of E12 in regulating the B lineage phenotype since expression of EBF alone leads to the activation of a subset of E12 - inducible traits.

Our data demonstrate that, in the context of this macrophage line, E12 induces expression of EBF and together these transcription factors coordinately regulate numerous B lineage - associated genes.

Role of cell cycle regulation.	[]
A 5. 4 - kilobase mRNA, the expression of which is down - regulated after treatment of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs) with various T cell - activating agents, was isolated using an mRNA differential display method.	[]
Nucleotide sequence analysis identified the 5 ' end of this RNA as human retinoid receptor RXRalpha mRNA.

Here, we report the nucleotide sequence of 3. 6 kilobases of this RNA, which represents the 3 ' end of RXRalpha mRNA, the sequence of which has not been previously described.

Activated PBMCs also expressed lower levels of RXRalpha protein, and a DNA binding assay showed that the activation - induced loss of RXRalpha mRNA and protein expression correlated with the loss of DNA binding activity of this protein.

We present evidence that the transition from G0 / G1 to S phase of the cell cycle results in the down - regulation of RXRalpha expression and that cell cycle inhibitors, which block the cells in G1 phase, prevent this down - regulation.

Epidemiology and pathogenesis of AIDS - related lymphomas.	[]
Among patients with congenital and acquired immunodeficiencies, non - Hodgkin ' s lymphoma ( NHLs) are the most common tumors of the immune system.	[]
In the setting of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV) infection, as many as 10% to 20% of people ultimately developed NHLs.	[]
These tumors are clinically aggressive, frequently involve extranodal sites, and often exhibit unique features that distinguish them from NHL arising in individuals with other forms of immunosuppression.	[]
Important in the development of HIV - associated NHL are cytokines and other factors that induce B - cell proliferation and increase the likelihood of mutations of c - myc, bcl - 6, and other tumor - suppressor genes with carcinogenic potential.

Within 6 hours, an accumulation of apolipoprotein B and epitopes present on oxLDL are detected in the arterial endothelium and media.	"epitopes	56	64	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""epitopes"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The presence of oxLDL is associated with activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor - kappaB in the endothelium as well as endothelial expression of intercellular adhesion molecule - 1.	"transcription factor	59	79	Gene/Protein"	"nuclear factor - kappaB	80	103	Gene/Protein"	"intercellular adhesion molecule - 1	160	195	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""transcription factor"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""nuclear factor - kappaB"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""intercellular adhesion molecule - 1"", ""start_span"": 160, ""end_span"": 195, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Injection of LDL enriched with the antioxidant probucol resulted in arterial accumulation of apolipoprotein B, but the expression of oxLDL - specific epitopes was reduced at 24 hours.	[]
Thus, this simple model has the potential to analyze the mechanisms behind and biological effects of LDL oxidation in vivo.	[]

Adherence, which is important for MO differentiation, induced CRABP II expression, but the addition of 10 ( - 7) M retinoic acid inhibited the upregulation of CRABP II expression during MO / MAC differentiation.

A stable and stoichiometric complex of CaMKIV with protein serine - threonine phosphatase 2A ( PP2A) was identified in which PP2A dephosphorylates CaMKIV and functions as a negative regulator of CaMKIV signaling.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: To determine whether NF - kappa B is activated in patients with insufficient glycemic control ( HbA1c > 10%), we developed a tissue culture - independent electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA) - based semiquantitative detection system that allowed us to determine NF - kappa B activation in ex vivo - isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs).

10 of those received the antioxidant thioctic acid ( 600 mg / day p. o.) for 2 weeks.	[]

Stem cell factor ( SCF) and erythropoietin ( EPO) work synergistically to support erythropoiesis, but the mechanism for this synergism is unknown.

By using purified human erythroid colony - forming cells ( ECFC), we have found that SCF and EPO synergistically activate MAP kinase ( MAPK, ERK1 / 2), which correlates with the cell growth and thus may be responsible for the synergistic effects.

Treatment of the cells with PD98059 and wortmannin, inhibitors of MEK and PI - 3 kinase, respectively, inhibited the synergistic activation of MAPK and also the cell growth, further supporting this conclusion.

Wortmannin only inhibits MAPK activation induced by EPO but not that by SCF, suggesting that SCF and EPO may activate MAPK through different pathways, which would facilitate synergy.

Furthermore, EPO, but not SCF, led to activation of STAT5, whereas SCF and wortmannin had no effect on the EPO - induced STAT5 activation, suggesting that STAT5 is not involved in the synergistic action of SCF and EPO.

The molecular and phenotypic profile of primary central nervous system lymphoma identifies distinct categories of the disease and is consistent with histogenetic derivation from germinal center - related B cells.	[]
Primary central nervous system lymphoma ( PCNSL) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV) - infected individuals.	[]
The precise histogenetic derivation and the molecular pathogenesis of PCNSL is poorly understood.	[]
In an attempt to clarify the histogenesis and pathogenesis of these lymphomas, 49 PCNSL ( 26 acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [ AIDS] - related and 23 AIDS - unrelated) were analyzed for multiple biologic markers, which are known to bear histogenetic and pathogenetic significance for mature B - cell neoplasms.	[]
PCNSL associated frequently ( 50. 0%) with mutations of BCL - 6 5 ' noncoding regions, which are regarded as a marker of B - cell transition through the germinal center ( GC).

Expression of BCL - 6 protein, which is restricted to GC B cells throughout physiologic B - cell maturation, was detected in 100% AIDS - unrelated PCNSL and in 56. 2% AIDS - related cases.

Notably, among AIDS - related PCNSL, expression of BCL - 6 was mutually exclusive with expression of Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV) - encoded latent membrane protein ( LMP) - 1 and, with few exceptions, also of BCL - 2.

All but one PCNSL expressed hMSH2, which among mature B cells selectively stains GC B cells.	[]
These data suggest that PCNSL may be frequently related to GC B cells and may be segregated into two major biologic categories based on the expression pattern of BCL - 6, LMP - 1, and BCL - 2.

BCL - 6 ( +) / LMP - 1 ( -) / BCL - 2 ( -) PCNSL occur both in the presence and in the absence of HIV infection and consistently display a large noncleaved cell morphology.

Conversely, BCL - 6 ( -) / LMP - 1 ( +) / BCL - 2 ( +) PCNSL are restricted to HIV - infected hosts and are represented by lymphomas with immunoblastic features.

Antioxidant regulation of phorbol ester - induced adhesion of human Jurkat T - cells to endothelial cells.	[]
Regulation of adhesion molecule expression and function by reactive oxygen species via specific redox sensitive mechanisms have been reported.	[]
The effects of clinically safe antioxidants in the regulation of adhesion molecule expression in human endothelial cells ( ECV), and adherence of human Jurkat T cells to ECV cells were investigated.	[]
The thiol antioxidant, alpha - lipoate, at clinically relevant doses down - regulated phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA) - induced adhesion molecule expression and cell - cell adhesion.	[]
Inhibition of PMA - induced ICAM - 1 and VCAM - 1 expression as well as PMA - induced adhesion of Jurkat T - cells to ECV cells by alpha - lipoate was dose dependent ( 50 - 250 microM).	[]
The effect was significant for ICAM - 1 ( p <. 01) and VCAM - 1 ( p <. 01) expression in cells pretreated with 100 microM alpha - lipoate compared to PMA - activated untreated cells.

Inhibition of PMA - induced adhesion molecule expression and cell - cell adhesion was more pronounced when a combination of antioxidants, alpha - lipoate and alpha - tocopherol, were used compared to the use of either of these antioxidant alone.	[]
The regulation of adhesion molecule expression and function by low concentration of antioxidants investigated does not appear to be NF - kappaB regulated or transcription dependent because no change in the mRNA response was observed.

Protein kinase C ( PKC) has been suggested to regulate PMA - induced adhesion molecule expression by post - transcriptional stabilization of adhesion molecule mRNA.

Alpha - lipoate pretreatment did not influence the response of PKC activity to PMA.	"PKC	63	66	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PKC"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Oxidants are known to be involved in the regulation of cell adhesion processes.	[]
Treatment of ECV cells with PMA induced generation of intracellular oxidants.	[]
Alpha - lipoate ( 100 or 250 microM) treatment decreased PMA - induced generation of intracellular oxidants.	[]
The inhibitory effect of low concentration of alpha - lipaote alone or in combination with alpha - tocopherol on agonist - induced adhesion processes observed in this study may be of potential therapeutic value.	[]
Binding of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 to CD4 and CXCR4 receptors differentially regulates expression of inflammatory genes and activates the MEK / ERK signaling pathway.

We have previously shown that binding of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV - 1) virions to CD4 receptors stimulates association of Lck with Raf - 1 and results in the activation of Raf - 1 kinase in a Ras - independent manner.

In the present study, we demonstrate that HIV - 1 envelope glycoproteins of both T - cell - tropic and macrophagetropic strains rapidly activate the ERK / mitogen - activated protein ( MAP) kinase pathway and the binding of nuclear transcription factors ( AP - 1, NF - kappaB, and C / EBP) and stimulate expression of cytokine and chemokine genes.

The activation of this signaling pathway requires functional CD4 receptors and is independent of binding to CXCR4.

Binding of the natural ligand stromal cell - derived factor 1 ( SDF - 1) to CXCR4, which inhibits entry of T - cell - tropic HIV - 1, activates also the ERK / MAP kinase pathway.

However, SDF - 1 did not affect the CD4 - mediated expression of cytokine and chemokine genes.

These results provide firm molecular evidence that binding of HIV - 1 envelope glycoproteins to CD4 receptor initiates a signaling pathway ( s) independent of the binding to the chemokine receptor that leads to the aberrant expression of inflammatory genes and may contribute significantly to HIV - 1 replication as well as to deregulation of the immune system.

The bcl - 6 proto - oncogene encodes a POZ / zinc finger transcriptional repressor expressed in germinal center ( GC) B and T cells and required for GC formation and antibody affinity maturation.

Deregulation of bcl - 6 expression by chromosomal rearrangements and point mutations of the bcl - 6 promoter region are implicated in the pathogenesis of B - cell lymphoma.

Phosphorylation, in turn, targets BCL - 6 for rapid degradation by the ubiquitin / proteasome pathway.

Nevertheless, whole cell binding studies reveal similar levels of GR in immature thymic T lymphocytes and more mature, splenic T lymphocytes.	"GR	66	68	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GR"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

The mammalian E2A, HEB, and E2 - 2 genes encode a unique class of basic helix - loop - helix ( bHLH) transcription factors that are evolutionarily conserved and essential for embryonic and postnatal development.	[]
While the structural and functional similarities among the gene products are well demonstrated, it is not clear why deletion of E2A, but not HEB or E2 - 2, leads to a complete arrest in B - lymphocyte development.

To understand the molecular basis of the functional specificity between E2A and HEB / E2 - 2 in mammalian development, we generated and tested a panel of E2A knockin mutations including subtle mutations in the E12 and E47 exons and substitution of both E12 and E47 exons with a human HEB cDNA.

Further, we find that HEB driven by the endogenous E2A promoter can functionally replace E2A in supporting B - cell commitment and differentiation toward completion.

Differential protection of normal and malignant human myeloid progenitors ( CFU - GM) from Ara - C toxicity using cycloheximide.	[]
Cycloheximide, a reversible protein synthesis inhibitor, is thought to block DNA replication in normal cells by preventing synthesis of a labile protein.	"labile protein	138	152	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""labile protein"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

Malignant cells appear not to be susceptible to cycloheximide - induced cycle arrest and, subsequently, may not be protected from Ara - C cytotoxicity.	[]
The effect of cycloheximide on granulocyte / macrophage progenitors ( CFU - GM) after in vitro Ara - C exposure was examined using normal human bone marrow, malignant progenitors from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML), and clonogenic cells from the human acute nonlymphocytic leukemia cell lines HL - 60 and KG - 1.

Mononuclear or clonogenic cells were incubated for one hour with cycloheximide, followed by the addition, for three or 17 hours, of Ara - C before being plated in a methylcellulose culture system.	[]
CFU - GM survival was significantly increase if normal cells were treated with cycloheximide before Ara - C exposure.	[]

Specific uptake of 1, 25 - dihydroxycholecalcif by human chronic myeloid leukemia cells.	[]
We have examined mononuclear cell preparations from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia [ CML] for binding of and response to 1, 25 - dihydroxycholecalcif [ 1, 25 - ( OH) 2D3].	[]
Whole cells specifically took up [ 3H] - 1, 25 - ( OH) 2D3 with high affinity ( Kd 3. 6 X 10 ( - 11) M) and low capacity.	[]
Subcellular fractionation of labeled cells showed that binding was restricted to cytosols and nuclei.	[]
Sucrose gradient centrifugation of cells preincubated with [ 3H] - 1, 25 - ( OH) 2D3 revealed a single 3. 6S peak which was totally displaced with 100 - fold excess nonradioactive hormone.	[]
However, we were unable to demonstrate specific binding of 1, 25 - ( OH) 2D3 by postlabeling standard cytosol preparations.	[]
In addition, cytosols prepared from a mixture of CML cells and 1, 25 - ( OH) 2D3 receptor - positive T47D ( human breast cancer) cells had less than 10% of the binding measured in T47D cytosol alone.	[]
However, the levels of binding in T47D cytosols were not reduced if the receptors were occupied with [ 3H] - 1, 25 - ( OH) 2D3 prior to the addition of the CML cytosols.	[]
Thus, CML cells appear to contain both the receptor for 1, 25 - ( OH) 2D3 and an unknown substance which prevents its detection following the preparation of cytosol.	[]
Cells from patients with CML in the chronic phase specifically bound more 1, 25 - ( OH) 2D3 [ 18. 0 + / - 3. 2 ( S. E.) fmol / 10 ( 7) cells] than did those in acute myeloid transformation [ 7. 2 + / - 1. 5] or than did cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia [ 2. 6 + / - 0. 8].	[]
Only cells from the first group of patients responded to the addition of 1, 25 - ( OH) 2D3 by differentiating along the monocyte - macrophage pathway.	[]
We conclude that the differentiation - induction effect of 1, 25 - ( OH) 2D3 is likely to depend on adequate levels of receptor and that intact cells rather than cytosol preparations should be studied before cells of a particular tissue are designated as receptor negative.	[]
Effect of cell cycle position on dexamethasone binding by mouse and human lymphoid cell lines: correlation between an increase in dexamethasone binding during S phase and dexamethasone sensitivity.	[]
We determined the effect of cell cycle position on the amount of dexamethasone that was specifically bound by mouse and human lymphoid cell lines.	[]
Cell lines that were either sensitive or resistant to growth inhibition by dexamethasone were compared.	[]
Exponentially growing cells were separated by centrifugal elutriation into fractions that corresponded to different positions in the cell cycle.	[]
The cell cycle phase distribution of each fraction was estimated by flow cytometry and autoradiography.	[]
The amount of dexamethasone bound per cell in each fraction was measured by a whole cell binding assay.	[]
In three dexamethasone - sensitive cell lines ( two mouse and one human), we found that the amount of dexamethasone bound per cell increased 2 - 4 - fold between G1 phase and S phase, and then decreased during G2 / M phase.	[]
Results were the same when the amount of dexamethasone bound per milligram of cell protein was measured.	"cell protein	78	90	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cell protein"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Binding affinity was the same during G1 phase and S phase, but the proportion of bound dexamethasone that translocated to the nucleus was greater during S phase.	[]
In contrast, we found that the amount of dexamethasone bound per cell by three dexamethasone - resistant cell lines ( two mouse and one human) did not increase during S phase.	[]
Our results indicate that cell cycle changes in dexamethasone binding are not simply related to changes in cell protein or cell volume during the cell cycle.	"cell protein	107	119	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cell protein"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

Correlation to their glucocorticoid - like effects on in vitro functions of human mononuclear leukocytes.	[]

As compared to the reference compound dexamethasone ( relative receptor binding affinity defined as 100%), two potent synthetic progestins with a pregnane - type structure, megestrol acetate and medroxyprogesterone acetate, were found to display a considerable binding affinity towards the receptor ( 46 and 42%, respectively).

The relative binding affinity of the naturally occurring ligand, cortisol, to the receptor was clearly lower ( 25%).	[]

The progestin effect appears to be mediated through a radiosensitive ( suppressor) subpopulation of T lymphocytes.	[]
In contrast, the synthetic progestins related structurally to 19 - nortestosterone, norethisterone and d - norgestrel, were virtually devoid of binding affinity towards the glucocorticoid receptor nor did they measurably influence the in vitro lymphocyte functions.

Metabolic and ultrastructural aspects of the in vitro lysis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells by glucocorticoids.	[]
Human chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL) cells like prothymocytes and immunoactivated T - lymphocytes are readily lysed in vitro by pharmacological concentrations of glucocorticoids such as cortisol, whereas peripheral blood lymphocytes and thymocytes are unaffected by the hormone.

In this study, metabolic and ultrastructural aspects of the cortisol - induced killing process of CLL cells are recorded.	[]
In vitro lysis was found to be temperature dependent and was detected only after 6 to 8 hr incubation with cortisol by means of the trypan blue exclusion test.	[]
However, 30 min of incubation with cortisol at either 37 degrees or 4 degrees followed by the removal of the hormone was still sufficient to induce the lytic process.	"hormone	109	116	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""hormone"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

This variability can not be explained by the known correlation between active cell proliferation and an increase in the number of receptors, since the tumors with the highest growth fraction ( i. e., Burkitt ' s lymphoma and T - cell leukemia) tend to have lower average receptor numbers than do tumors with lower growth fractions such as common ALL.	[]
All clinical specimens from patients with lymphatic leukemia have some measurable level of glucocorticoid receptors; therefore, the resistance seen in vivo can not be explained by the lack of receptors.

However, there has been a positive correlation, in our hands, with receptor level and prognosis.	[]
On the basis of in vitro models, it is proposed that perhaps the high receptor cell lines ( i. e., common ALL of childhood) have relative stability of their genetic material making glucocorticoid - resistant mutations less likely to occur in patients with these cells than in low - receptor cell lines ( i. e., T - cell leukemia).	[]
This greater genetic variability in the low - receptor lines could account for the earlier emergence of clinical glucocorticoid resistance in these patients.	[]

It appears that pseudohypoaldosteron is caused by a Type I receptor defect, that the defect may be complete or partial, that transmission may be autosomal recessive, and that the study of patients with pseudohypoaldosteron may indicate physiologic roles for Type I receptors in nonepithelial tissues.

Characterization of aldosterone binding sites in circulating human mononuclear leukocytes.	[]
Aldosterone binding sites in human mononuclear leukocytes were characterized after separation of cells from blood by a Percoll gradient.	[]
After washing and resuspension in RPMI - 1640 medium, cells were incubated at 37 degrees C for 1 h with different concentrations of [ 3H] aldosterone plus a 100 - fold concentration of RU - 26988 ( 11 alpha, 17 alpha - dihydroxy - 17 beta - propynylandrost - 1, 4, 6 - trien - 3 - one), with or without an excess of unlabeled aldosterone.	[]
Aldosterone binds to a single class of receptors with an affinity of 2. 7 + / - 0. 5 nM ( means + / - SD, n = 14) and a capacity of 290 + / - 108 sites / cell ( n = 14).	[]
The specificity data show a hierarchy of affinity of desoxycorticosterone = corticosterone = aldosterone greater than hydrocortisone greater than dexamethasone.	[]

Short - term and long - term effects of estrogen on lymphoid tissues and lymphoid cells with some remarks on the significance for carcinogenesis.	[]
Estrogens have long been thought to play a role in regulating the immune system.	[]
The difference in some types of immune responses between males and females is well - known, as is the pronounced thymic involution induced by exogenous estrogens.	[]
Estrogens stimulate some aspects of macrophage activity and, depending on dose and mitogen, inhibit or stimulate lymphocyte proliferative response in vitro.	"mitogen	83	90	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""mitogen"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Another example is the estrogen effect on the delayed type hypersensitivity response.	[]
A broad review is given of such estrogen effects on lymphoid tissue and immune response.	[]
Most of the studies published so far are phenomenological.	[]
However, the recent description of estrogen receptors in the thymus and in some lymphocyte subpopulations, as well as a deeper understanding of regulating factors in the immune system, open the possibility of a more detailed understanding of the estrogen mechanism of interference.

Estrogen effects in adults are reversible.	[]
After treating neonatal mice with the synthetic estrogen diethylstilbestrol ( DES), disturbances are induced in lymphocyte populations and lymphocyte functions which are permanent and irreversible.	[]

A detailed analysis demonstrated a decreased T helper cell population.	[]
The activity of Natural Killer cells is permanently reduced and this functional impairment is related to a decreased number of these cells, in turn determined at the bone marrow level.	[]

The association between estrogen - associated malignancy and estrogen effects in lymphocyte functions deserves further study.	[]
Drugs affecting the hormonal receptors of normal and leukaemic peripheral leucocytes.	[]
The authors investigated the behaviour of steroid hormone uptake in leukaemic cells ( CML, CLL, AML, ALL), in basal conditions and after incubation with drugs which modify the cellular concentration of cAMP, PGE and PGF.	[]
The results demonstrated the presence in leukaemic cells of an alteration in the incorporation of steroid hormones.	[]
This alteration was scarcely modified by incubation with theophylline, which increases cellular concentration of cAMP.	"theophylline	57	69	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""theophylline"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
On the other hand, it was moderately counteracted by thioproline and was evidently inhibited by flurbiprofen, which also reduced cellular concentrations of prostaglandins, particularly PGE2, with the exception of PGF2 which showed a poor response.	[]
Differences were observed in the behavior of hormonal uptake of CML, in contrast to that of AML, CLL and ALL peripheral leucocytes.	[]
Human breast cancer and impaired NK cell function.	[]
Recent advances in tumor immunology have led to the discovery of a new lymphoid cell with unique antitumor activity.	[]
Natural killer ( NK) cells form an antitumor surveillance system and appear to be vital in preventing tumor growth and metastasis in animal models.	[]
We studied NK activity in patients with benign and malignant breast disease, using a chromium - 51 release microtiter cytotoxicity assay with K562 cells as targets.	[]
Compared with benign controls, patients with malignancies had significantly depressed NK - mediated lysis ( P less than 0. 01).	[]
Furthermore, lysis in those with advanced disease ( stages II, III, and IV) was significantly less than in those with limited disease ( stage I) ( P less than 0. 01).	[]
NK activity was not correlated to estrogen or progesterone receptor states.	[]
Positive correlation of a depressed natural killer activity with the extent of tumor spread supports the concept of an NK cell immune surveillance system in breast cancer and emphasizes its importance in this malignancy.	[]
Immunosuppressive effect of serum progesterone during pregnancy depends on the progesterone binding capacity of the lymphocytes.	[]
Cytotoxic activity and progesterone binding capacity of the lymphocytes, together with serum progesterone concentrations, were determined in women with normal pregnancy or with a clinical diagnosis of threatened abortion or threatened premature labour.	[]
The lymphocytes of women with threatened abortion or threatened premature labour showed significantly higher cytotoxic activity ( P less than 0. 001) and significantly lower progesterone binding capacity ( P less than 0. 001) than did lymphocytes obtained from the healthy pregnant women.	[]
Significant inverse correlation was found between progesterone binding capacity and cytotoxic activity of the lymphocytes ( P less than 0. 001), but the progesterone concentration of the pregnancy serum appeared to have no influence on the other two parameters.	[]
The findings indicate that intact progesterone binding capacity of the lymphocytes is an essential factor for the manifestation of the blocking effect exerted by pregnancy serum on lymphocyte cytotoxicity in vitro.	[]

Moreover, an increasing tendency in the activities of serum alkaline phosphatase and gamma - glutamyltransferase during the interferon therapy shows that interferon may slightly interfere with the liver function.

By exposing human blood - derived macrophages and alveolar macrophages in vitro to dexamethasone, we showed in these studies that glucocorticoids markedly suppress the antimicrobial activity of macrophages but not macrophage activation by lymphokines.	[]
As little as 2. 5 X 10 ( - 8) mol / liter of dexamethasone prevented macrophages from inhibiting germination of Aspergillus spores or from eliminating ingested bacteria such as Listeria, Nocardia, or Salmonella.	[]
Damage to macrophage function was inhibited by progesterone and appeared to be receptor - mediated.	[]
In accordance with in vivo observations, dexamethasone required 24 - 36 h to suppress antimicrobial activity.	[]
While glucocorticoids interfered with base - line activity of macrophages, dexamethasone concentrations comparable to drug levels in patients had no effect on macrophage activation.	[]
Proliferating lymphocytes and gamma - interferon thus increased the antimicrobial activity of phagocytes exposed to glucocorticoids over that of control cells.

White cells from depressed patients with significant hypercortisolemia would be expected to show a similar change in receptor concentration if peripheral tissues are adequately exposed to and sensitive to the hormone.	[]
In this study we compared the binding of [ 3H] dexamethasone to lymphocytes from normal subjects and depressed patients with hypercortisolemia.	[]
Lymphocytes from normal subjects had a mean receptor concentration of 10. 2 + / - 0. 66 fm / 10 ( 6) cells ( S. E. M.) and a dissociation constant of 4. 8 + / - 0. 47 nM.	[]
Lymphocytes from depressed patients with abnormal 0800 h serum cortisol after dexamethasone had a mean receptor concentration of 8. 8 + / - 0. 75 fm / 10 ( 6) cells, which was not significantly different from that in lymphocytes from normal subjects or from depressed subjects with normal post - dexamethasone cortisol levels ( 9. 4 + / - 0. 95 fm / 10 ( 6) cells).	[]
Lymphocytes from depressed patients with elevated urinary free cortisol excretion ( UFC) also had normal receptor concentration and binding affinity for dexamethasone.	[]
The lack of a change in lymphocyte glucocorticoid receptor concentration in the presence of cortisol excess suggests the possibility that hypercortisolemia in depressive illness represents a state of peripheral glucocorticoid resistance.

The glucocorticoid receptor is an intracellular protein which possesses three distinct domains, one that binds agonist and antagonist steroids, one that binds DNA, and one that binds anti - receptor antibodies and is required for glucocorticoid modulation of gene expression.

In intact cells, receptor number, affinity and activity can change in response to factors that bind to the receptor, or that act indirectly through ill - defined mechanisms which may include resumption or arrest of cell cycling and variations in intracellular calcium ion concentrations.	[]
Some of these factors appear to exert their effect by controlling critical receptor properties such as ATP - dependent phosphorylation, integrity of thiol groups, and exposure of key amino acid residues.

Glucocorticoid agonists promote the ' transformation ' of the receptor into the DNA - binding state, which is competent for modulating gene expression.	[]
Glucocorticoid antagonists are steroids that interact with the receptor but either fail to produce a stable complex or produce a stable but inefficient complex.

Although substituent groups that confer agonist or antagonist activity to the steroid have been identified, the molecular determinants of this difference at the receptor level remain unknown.	[]
Most in vitro and in vivo data on receptor regulation can be accommodated by postulating the existence of an intracellular cycle that involves five states of the receptor.	[]
The active free receptor is phosphorylated, reduced, and presumably oligomeric ( state A).	[]
Following binding of an agonist ( state B), it can become transformed by dissociation into its subunits and dephosphorylation ( state C).	[]
The transformed receptor then interacts with chromatin ( state D).

The thermodynamics of the interaction of glucocorticoids with their receptor were studied in cytosol from human lymphoblastoid cells.	[]
The rate and affinity constants of dexamethasone and cortisol between 0 degree and 25 degrees C were calculated by curve - fitting from time - course and equilibrium kinetics.	[]
The data were consistent with a simple reversible bimolecular interaction.	[]
Arrhenius and Va n ' t Hoff plots were curvilinear for both steroids.	[]
At equilibrium, the solution for the equation delta G = delta H - T X delta S ( eqn. 1) was ( in kJ X mol - 1) - 47 = 36 - 83 ( dexamethasone) and - 42 = - 9 - 33 ( cortisol) at 0 degree C.	[]
Enthalpy and entropy changes decreased quasi - linearly with temperature such that, at 25 degrees C, the respective values were - 50 = - 75 + 25 and - 43 = - 48 + 5.	[]
Thus, for both steroids, the interaction was entropy - driven at low temperature and became entirely enthalpy - driven at 20 degrees C.	[]
Thermodynamic values for the transition state were calculated from the rate constants.	[]
For the forward reaction, eqn. ( 1) gave 45 = 84 - 39 ( dexamethasone) and 46 = 60 - 14 ( cortisol) at 0 degree C, and 44 = 24 + 20 ( dexamethasone) and 46 = 28 + 18 ( cortisol) at 25 degrees C.	[]
These data fit quite well with a two - step model [ Ross & Subramanian ( 1981) Biochemistry 20, 3096 - 3102] proposed for ligand - protein interactions, which involves a partial immobilization of the reacting species governed by hydrophobic forces, followed by stabilization of the complex by short - range interactions.	[]
On the basis of this model, an analysis of the transition - state thermodynamics led to the conclusion that no more than half of the steroid molecular area is engaged in the binding process.	[]

Few but significant numbers of glucocorticoid receptors ( 2700 / cell) and no insulin receptors ( - 1 / cell) were found in the resting ( G0) phase.

As cells entered the G1a phase the specific binding of dexamethasone increased and of insulin took place.	[]
Although the specific binding further increased as T - cells entered the G1b phase ( as measured at 44 h of incubation and using hydroxyurea - treated cells), the major changes in the specific binding of dexamethasone took place during the period 16 - 20 h after stimulation.	[]
Based on these findings, it is concluded that both receptor types ( cell membrane and cytoplasmic receptors) are being formed and increased at G1 phase prior to cell proliferation, indicating the importance of G1 phase in immunoregulation.

Glucocorticoid receptors and cortico - sensitivity in a human clonal monocytic cell line, CM - SM.	"Glucocorticoid receptors	0	24	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Glucocorticoid receptors"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
CM - SM is a clonal line of human precursor mononuclear phagocytes inducible to macrophage differentiation in response to the tumor promoter phorbol ester 12 - O - tetradecanoyl - phorbol - 13 - acetate ( TPA).	[]
Untreated CM - SM cells contain single class, high - affinity ( KD = 4. 0 X 10 ( - 9) M) glucocorticoid - specific receptor sites ( approximately 60, 000 per cell), as measured by a whole cell assay, at 37 degrees C, using [ 3H] triamcinolone acetonide ( TA).	[]
Exposure of CM - SM to dexamethasone ( DEX) produced a progressive, dose - and time - related series of changes in CM - SM cell growth, saturation density, morphology, and functional properties, with half - maximal effects at about 10 ( - 9) M for DEX.	[]
TA - receptor sites rapidly decreased ( about 70%) after DEX treatment, without any apparent change in steroid specificity and affinity.	[]
After 5 days in culture with a saturating concentration ( 3. 6 X 10 ( - 8) M) of hormone, the cells reached a saturation density of about 9. 0 X 10 ( 6) viable cells / ml ( about 4. 0 X 10 ( 6) viable cells / ml in the controls), while the modal volume of the resulting cell population was approximately 60%, as compared to the volume of untreated cells.	[]
DEX - treated cells appeared less differentiated than controls, as assessed by combined morphologic, antigenic, and cytoenzymatic analyses.	[]
DEX almost completely inhibited TPA activation of the following macrophage functions: adherency to the culture plate, expression of lysosomal enzymes, Fc and C3 receptors, and stimulation of phagocytosis.

After removal of DEX, the cells, within a few passages, returned to a state apparently identical to the untreated controls and could be induced to macrophage differentiation in response to TPA.	[]
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children: current status, controversies, and future perspective.	[]
Disease - free survival ( DFS) in childhood ALL is 60%, and survival in good, average, and poor prognostic groups defined by initial WBC and age is 90, 60, and 45%, respectively.	[]
Additional immunological, morphological, biochemical, cytokinetic, and cytogenetic factors have been identified, illustrating the heterogeneity of ALL and its derivation from malignant clones at various stages of differentiation and with varying rates of proliferation.	[]
Of biologic importance, these factors may refine further the characteristic features of clinically - determined prognostic groups.	[]
Multivariate analysis of large prospective trials with homogeneous therapy will be required to determine the independent prognostic importance of these factors.	[]
Current treatment strategies in ALL include ( 1) tailoring therapy and its intensity to prognostic groups; ( 2) multiple - drug combinations in induction; ( 3) early use of intrathecal ( IT) methotrexate ( MTX); ( 4) CNS prophylaxis with IT MTX alone in good prognosis patients and combined cranial radiation ( CXRT), 1800 rads plus IT MTX, in average and poor prognosis patients.	[]
Current studies show a CNS relapse rate of 5% in all prognostic groups.	[]
Late neuropsychological defects caused by cranial XRT and IT MTX have prompted programs designed to reduce the potential late toxicity of CNS prophylaxis.	[]
More pronounced in younger children, these abnormalities include decreased IQ, visual - motor incoordination, poor performance in mathematics, and memory dysfunction.	[]
Until 1980, more intensive induction, consolidation, and maintenance therapy had failed to prolong DFS in children with a poor prognosis.	[]
In West Germany ( Berlin - Frankfurt - Muenster protocol) a 70 to 75% DFS is seen in all patients regardless of initial WBC, suggesting that effective therapy will override prognostic factors.	[]
Ultra - high - dose MTX, without cranial radiation, is also showing promise in poor prognosis patients.	[]
Other issues include the optimal duration of therapy, the role of testicular biopsies, and prophylactic testicular radiation.	[]
Recent studies suggest that prognostic factors lose their significance after 2 years of continuous complete remission and that 2 years of maintenance therapy is adequate.	[]
Bilateral open - wedge testicular biopsies have identified occult testicular disease in 8 to 10% of males.	[]
A unified approach to children with leukemia / lymphoma, a group with a particularly poor prognosis, utilizing NHL - type therapy may be more effective than conventional ALL therapy.	[]

Glucocorticoid receptor and in vitro sensitivity to steroid hormones in human lymphoproliferative diseases and myeloid leukemia.	"Glucocorticoid receptor	0	23	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Glucocorticoid receptor"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The glucocorticoid receptor ( GR) quantitation by a whole - cell assay and / or cytosol technique and the in vitro sensitivity to steroids have been assessed in peripheral blood cells from normal donors and patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia ( CLL), acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL), lymphosarcoma cell leukemia ( LSCL), acute nonlymphatic leukemia ( ANLL), and chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML).

Within the lymphoproliferative diseases, ALL cells exhibited the highest GR concentration ( regardless of the method used) and the highest in vitro inhibition of spontaneous [ 3H] thymidine ( [ 3H] TdR) uptake by glucocorticoids.	"GR	73	75	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GR"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
A significant relationship between GR concentration ( whole - cell assay) and in vitro sensitivity to dexamethasone was also found.	"GR	35	37	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GR"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
On the contrary, CLL cells presented the highest sensitivity to glucocorticoids in PHA - stimulated cell cultures.	[]
Cells from the only two ALL patients who did not undergo a remission after glucocorticoid - inclusive chemotherapy had both the lowest in vitro sensitivity to dexamethasone and the lowest GR concentration with whole - cell assay.	[]
Concerning myeloid leukemia, ANLL patients had GR concentrations slightly higher than those found in the ALL group but exhibited the lowest degree of inhibition of spontaneous [ 3H] TdR uptake by dexamethasone ( stimulatory effects occurred in some cases).	"GR	47	49	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GR"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
CML cells exhibited an inhibition degree by in vitro glucocorticoids significantly higher than that of ANLL cells but not different from that of lymphoproliferative diseases.	[]
No clear relationship among GR pattern, in vitro cell sensitivity to glucocorticoids, and clinicohematologic parameters was observed in myeloid leukemia - bearing patients.	[]
Glucocorticoid receptors and in vitro corticosensitivity of peanut - positive and peanut - negative human thymocyte subpopulations.	"Glucocorticoid receptors	0	24	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Glucocorticoid receptors"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In 6 human thymus glands, the immature subset of thymocytes was separated from the more mature one, by differential peanut lectin agglutination.	[]
These 2 cell subpopulations were analyzed for glucocorticoid receptor content by using a whole cell assay, with ( 3H) - triamcinolone acetonide as tracer.	"glucocorticoid receptor	46	69	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""glucocorticoid receptor"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The unagglutinated thymocytes ( peanut negative) contained about 2 times more receptor sites per cell than agglutinated ( peanut positive) ones ( 7650 + / - 1550 S. D. verus 3195 + / - 896 S. D.).	[]
The affinity for steroid was similar in both cell subsets, as was the stereospecificity for glucocorticoids, the time - course of steroid - receptor association, and cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation.	[]
Despite the greater number of glucocorticoid receptor sites, the peanut - negative thymocyte subpopulation did not differ from the peanut - positive one in its sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of triamcinolone acetonide, as determined by measurements of the incorporation of radiolabeled precursors of protein and DNA.	"glucocorticoid receptor	30	53	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""glucocorticoid receptor"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Moreover, the peanut - negative subset appeared more resistant in vitro to the steroid - induced cell lysis as compared to the peanut - positive one.	[]
Thus, our data suggest that glucocorticoid receptor density and corticosensitivity are not directly correlated and that the number of glucocorticoid receptor sites may be dependent on the degree of immunologic maturation	"glucocorticoid receptor	28	51	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""glucocorticoid receptor"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Defective binding and function of 1, 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptors in peripheral mononuclear cells of patients with end - organ resistance to 1, 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D.	[]
Lectin - induced DNA synthesis by peripheral mononuclear cells from 17 normal donors was inhibited ( 40 - 60%) by 1, 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1, 25 [ OH] 2D3) at physiological concentrations ( 10 ( - 10) - 10 ( - 9) M).	[]
The lymphocytes acquire specific receptors for 1, 25 ( OH) 2D3 upon activation by the lectins.	"lectins	86	93	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""lectins"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
This process precedes the inhibitory effect of 1, 25 ( OH) 2D3.	[]
We studied lymphocytes from six patients from four different kindreds with the syndrome of hereditary end - organ resistance to 1, 25 ( OH) 2D ( the so - called vitamin D - dependent rickets type II).	[]
In five patients ( three kindreds) peripheral blood mononuclear cells did not acquire receptors for 1, 25 ( OH) 2D3 upon phytohemagglutinin - induced activation.	[]
Moreover, in contrast to normal lymphocytes, the mitogenic stimulation of these patients ' lymphocytes by phytohemagglutinin and concanavalin A was not inhibited by 1, 25 ( OH) 2D3.	"phytohemagglutinin	106	124	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""phytohemagglutinin"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Activated lymphocytes of the sixth patient from a fourth kindred exhibited normal binding of [ 3H] 1, 25 ( OH) 2D3 but the hormone failed to inhibit the mitogenic stimulation.	[]
A similar pattern of the vitamin D effector system was previously observed in fibroblasts cultured from skin biopsies of the same group of patients.	[]
The conclusions from these findings are: ( a) the inhibition of mitogenic stimulation by 1, 25 ( OH) 2D3 is mediated by specific functional receptors to the hormone; and ( b) the receptors for 1, 25 ( OH) 2D3 in mononuclear cells are probably controlled genetically by the same mechanisms as the effector system in well - characterized target organs of the hormone, such as intestine and kidney.

The present study was performed to analyse glucocorticoid receptor ( GR) binding in peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes ( MNL) from 39 myasthenia gravis ( MG) patients ( unoperated patients ( n = 13), thymectomized patients ( n = 14) and patients receiving glucocorticoids: thymectomized ( n = 11) and unoperated ( n = 6].

Immunological interference of high dose corticosteroids.	[]
High - dose corticosteroids ( HDC) will influence cellular as well as humoral participants of the immune response.	[]
The lymphoid tissue will decrease in size and weight after prolonged treatment with HDC.	[]
Lymphocyte functions will be impaired.	[]
Reduced synthesis of B - as well as T - lymphocytes will be seen.	[]
The inhibitory effect on B - cell function can be observed both as decreased serum levels of immunoglobulins and as impaired binding of antibodies and complement to the cellular surface.

Reduced lymphocyte adherence to antigen and suppressed lymphocyte reaction have also been observed.	[]
Humoral factors involved in chemotaxis, opsonisation, phagocytosis, vascular permeability leading to leakage of fluid and cells and factors involved in lysis of antigens are impaired.	[]
This can be explained partly by the observed reduced complement activation via the alternative as well as the classical pathway in association with HDC therapy.	[]
Acute processes with increased vascular permeability and accumulation of leukocytes as impairing factors could be influenced beneficially by HDC therapy.	[]
This positive effect can be seen in treatment of septic shock or rejection of a transplant.	[]
However, if sepsis or rejection is not rapidly reversed, complications such as multisystem organ failure and bacteremia are prone to appear.	[]

Sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of [ 3H] DM - labeled IM - 9 cytosol identified a major competable band with a molecular weight of approximately 90, 000, three minor competable components with molecular weights of approximately 78, 000, approximately 51, 000, and approximately 38, 500, and at least 21 other noncompetable components.	[]
Following immunoprecipitation of [ 3H] DM - labeled cytosol with immune serum, only the Mr 90, 000 and 78, 000 components were seen.	[]
Sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of [ 3H] DM - labeled CEM - C7 cytosol revealed a larger number of [ 3H] DM - labeled components.	[]
However, after immunoprecipitation of [ 3H] DM - labeled CEM - C7 cytosol, a predominant competable component with a molecular weight of 90, 000 was easily identified.	[]
This component was markedly diminished when cytosols from the glucocorticoid receptor - deficient cell line ICR - 27 were used.	[]
Thus, the combination of affinity labeling and anti - human glucocorticoid receptor antibodies is capable of providing direct physical identification of human lymphoid glucocorticoid receptors.

Incubation with thymosin fraction 5, ( TMS F5 at 300 micrograms / ml) a partially purified thymic factor, reduced the steroid binding activity of human infant thymocytes from 9. 6 + / - 2. 1 fmole / ml to 5. 0 + / - 2. 0 fmole / ml.	[]
The glucocorticoid receptor activity in normal infant thymocytes was found to be 2, 146 + / - 726 ( s. d.) sites per cell with dissociation constant of 1. 4 + / - 0. 6 X 10 ( - 8) M.

Effects of chronic glucocorticoid excess in man on insulin binding to circulating cells: differences between endogenous and exogenous hypercorticism.	[]
We measured [ 125I] insulin binding to circulating monocytes or erythrocytes from 16 patients with chronic glucocorticoid excess, 9 chronically treated with prednisone and 7 with adrenocortical hyperfunction.	[]
With monocytes, [ 125I] insulin binding was iincreased in all patients.	[]
Analysis of binding data indicated that increased binding in patients treated with prednisone was due to an ncrease in receptor concentration, whereas in patients with adrenocortical hyperfunction, it was due to an increase in receptor affinity.	[]
With erythrocytes from patients with adrenocortical hyperfunction there was an increase in receptor affinity and a decrease in receptor concentration, so that the binding of [ 125I] insulin was normal.	[]
The disparity of results between endogenous and exogenous hypercorticism, between the two cell types, and between the present studies and previous studies suggest that the effects of glucocorticoid excess on the insulin receptor are extremely complex and wide - ranging and that in this condition, extrapolations in humans from data with circulating cells to liver and muscle may not be appropriate.

Using a competitive binding whole cell assay, we have examined the binding of [ 3H] - dexamethasone at 24 and 37 degrees C in untreated normal subjects and in healthy subjects taking various glucocorticoid preparations.	[]
At 24 degrees C normal human lymphocytes had 6000 binding sites / cell and a dissociation constant of 4 x 10 ( - 9) M.	[]
The administration of 1 mg of dexamethasone, 5 mg of prednisone, and 37. 5 mg of cortisone acetate resulted in a 30% decrease in binding sites after 1 week with no change in binding affinity.	[]
No changes in the number of binding sites was noted before 1 week and the diminished number persisted for 1 week after discontinuation of glucocorticoid treatment.	[]
Lymphocytes from hospitalized patients taking 40 - 60 mg of dexamethasone daily demonstrated the same change in number of binding sites that was seen in normal subjects taking 1 mg of dexamethasone.	[]
When binding assays were carried out at physiologic temperature there was the same decrease in number of binding sites after dexamethasone administration, and in addition, there was a two - fold increase in binding affinity.	[]
Glucocorticoid administration results in a time - dependent decrease in the number of lymphocyte glucocorticoid binding sites that is independent of the type of glucocorticoid administered.	[]
This is the first in vivo demonstration that glucocorticoids modulate their own receptors in man.	[]

To directly examine the effect of 1, 25 - ( OH) 2D3 on T cell activation in the absence of other complicating interactions, we utilized a panel of cloned Ia - restricted T cell hybridomas that secrete IL 2 on activation by cloned Ia - bearing stimulator cells ( TA3) or when stimulated by mitogen.

Physiologic concentrations of 1, 25 - ( OH) 2D3 ( 0. 01 to 0. 1 nm) inhibited the antigen - induced secretion of IL 2 by several of these T cell hybridomas.	[]
This inhibition was dependent on the concentration of the free hormone and could be overcome by increasing the number of Ia - bearing stimulator cells used.	[]
Pretreatment of the T hybridoma but not the TA3 stimulator cell with 1, 25 - ( OH) 2D3 resulted in inhibition of activation.	[]
These results are consistent with the finding that specific 1, 25 - ( OH) 2D3 receptors are present on the T cell hybridomas but are lacking in TA3 cells.	[]
1, 25 - ( OH) 2D3 failed, however, to inhibit the activation of the T cell hybridomas by lectin or by an anti - Thy - 1 antibody.

Cortivazol ( CVZ) and deacylcortivazol ( DAC) are pyrazolosteroids with potent glucocorticoid activity.	[]
In previous work we showed that DAC is 40 - fold more potent than dexamethasone ( DEX) in lysing leukemic lymphoblasts.	[]
To assess the interaction between these atypical steroids and the glucocorticoid receptor, we examined the binding of [ 3H] CVZ to cytosol from glucocorticoid - sensitive and - resistant variants of the human leukemic cell line CEM C7.

Scatchard analysis of the binding of [ 3H] CVZ in glucocorticoid - sensitive cells revealed a curvilinear plot which resolved into high ( 0. 4 nM) and low ( 11 nM) affinity components.	[]
The receptor concentration of the low affinity site ( 0. 30 pmol / mg protein) was approximately twice that of the high affinity site ( 0. 14 pmol / mg protein).

Examination of the binding of [ 3H] CVZ using 10 ( - 5) M DEX as the competing ligand showed that DEX binds only to the low affinity site detected by [ 3H] CVZ.	[]
In cytosol from a glucocorticoid - resistant cell line with virtually no [ 3H] DEX binding, [ 3H] CVZ detected a single high affinity binding site that was similar in dissociation constant ( 0. 8 nM) and receptor concentration ( 0. 13 pmol / mg protein) to the high affinity site detected in the glucocorticoid - sensitive cell line C7.

Plasmacytoid blast crisis in B - cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia: effect of estradiol on growth and differentiation in vitro.	[]
Evolution of a case of chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL) into blast crisis was found to be characterized by three unusual features ( 1) the phenotype of the emerging blast cells was that of pre - plasmacytoid cells as shown by plasma cell morphology and an immunological phenotype corresponding partially with CLL - or intermediate B - cells, partially with plasma cells ( terminal transferase -, common acute lymphocytic leukemia antigen -, Ia +, surface immunoglobulin heavy chains -, surface kappa light chains +, intracytoplasmic immunoglobulin A + and G +, BA - 1 +, polyclonal gammaglobulin production); ( 2) cytogenetic analysis of spontaneous metaphases revealed that in addition to the typical CLL abnormality, trisomy 12, in all of the cells, an additional translocation between chromosomes 14 and 17 was present in 40% with a presumptive breakpoint on chromosome 14 ( q12 - 3) never described before ( commonly q32) and ( 3) the progression of the disease was associated with a striking increase in the expression by the transformed cells of specific binding sites for estradiol ( E2) due to an actual increase in total cellular receptor proteins and not to a change in receptor affinity for E2.

Due to Jurkat T - cells being IL - 2 - independent, it was postulated that IL - 2 might provide a necessary co - stimulus for phosphorylation of CREB in primary lymphocytes.

Interestingly, inhibiting PKC signaling with calphostin C further increased P - CREB levels 3 - fold over that observed in IL - 2 / CD3 co - stimulated cells not pretreated with a PKC inhibitor.	[]
In contrast to previous studies performed in the absence of exogenous IL - 2, no increase in binding of CREB to a 32P - labeled oligonucleotide probe was observed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay.

As a result of this interaction, p12 ( I) increases signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 ( STAT5) DNA binding and transcriptional activity and this effect depends on the presence of both IL - 2R beta and gamma ( c) chains and Jak3.

Transduction of primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs) with a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 - based retroviral vector expressing p12 ( I) also resulted in increased STAT5 phosphorylation and DNA binding.

To determine the mechanisms by which IL - 18 might regulate these diametrically distinct immune responses, we have analyzed the role of cytokines in the regulation of IL - 18 receptor alpha chain ( IL - 18Ralpha) expression.

IL - 12 - mediated upregulation of IL - 18Ralpha required IFN - gamma.

Activated CD4 ( +) T cells that expressed low levels of IL - 18Ralpha could produce IFN - gamma when stimulated with the combination of IL - 12 and IL - 18, while CD4 ( +) cells which expressed high levels of IL - 18Ralpha could respond to IL - 18 alone.

In contrast, T cell stimulation in the presence of IL - 4 resulted in a downregulation of IL - 18Ralpha expression.

Both IL - 4 ( - /) - and signal transducer and activator of transcription ( Stat) 6 ( - /) - T cells expressed higher levels of IL - 18Ralpha after TCR stimulation.

Glucocorticoids are the most effective antiinflammatory drugs used in the treatment of asthma.	[]

Differential ultraviolet - B - induced immunomodulation in XPA, XPC, and CSB DNA repair - deficient mice.	[]
Ultraviolet B irradiation has serious consequences for cellular immunity and can suppress the rejection of skin tumors and the resistance to infectious diseases.	[]
DNA damage plays a crucial role in these immunomodulatory effects of ultraviolet B, as impaired repair of ultraviolet - B - induced DNA damage has been shown to cause suppression of cellular immunity.	[]
Ultraviolet - B - induced DNA damage is repaired by the nucleotide excision repair mechanism very efficiently.	[]
Nucleotide excision repair comprises two subpathways: transcription - coupled and global genome repair.	[]
In this study the immunologic consequences of specific nucleotide excision repair defects in three mouse models, XPA, XPC, and CSB mutant mice, were investigated.	[]
XPA mice carry a total nucleotide excision repair defect, whereas XPC and CSB mice only lack global genome and transcription - coupled nucleotide excision repair, respectively.	[]
Our data demonstrate that cellular immune parameters in XPA, XPC, and CSB mice are normal compared with their wild - type ( control) littermates.	[]
This may indicate that the reported altered cellular responses in xeroderma pigmentosum patients are not constitutive but could be due to external factors, such as ultraviolet B.	[]
Upon exposure to ultraviolet B, only XPA mice are very sensitive to ultraviolet - B - induced inhibition of Th1 - mediated contact hypersensitivity responses and interferon - gamma production in skin draining lymph nodes.	"interferon - gamma	162	180	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""interferon - gamma"", ""start_span"": 162, ""end_span"": 180, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Lipopolysaccharide - stimulated tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin - 10 production are significantly augmented in both XPA and CSB mice after ultraviolet B exposure.	"tumor necrosis factor alpha	32	59	Gene/Protein"	"interleukin - 10	64	80	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""tumor necrosis factor alpha"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""interleukin - 10"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Lymph node cell numbers were increased very significantly in XPA, mildly increased in CSB, and not in XPC mice.	[]
In general XPC mice do not exhibit any indication of enhanced ultraviolet B susceptibility with regard to the immune parameters analyzed.	[]
These data suggest that both global genome repair and transcription - coupled repair are needed to prevent immunomodulation by ultraviolet B, whereas transcription - coupled repair is the major DNA repair subpathway of nucleotide excision repair that prevents the acute ultraviolet - B - induced effects such as erythema.

Biomechanical strain induces class a scavenger receptor expression in human monocyte / macrophages and THP - 1 cells: a potential mechanism of increased atherosclerosis in hypertension.

BACKGROUND: Although hypertension is an important risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis, the mechanisms for this interaction are incompletely described.	[]
Previous studies have suggested that biomechanical strain regulates macrophage phenotype.	[]
We tested the hypothesis that biomechanical strain can induce expression of the class A scavenger receptor ( SRA), an important lipoprotein receptor in atherogenesis.

Mechanical strains induced SRA mRNA ( 3. 5 + / - 0. 6 - fold at 3% strain for 48 hours, P < 0. 01) and SRA protein in THP - 1 cells in an amplitude - dependent manner.

This induction was accompanied by augmented expression of the class B scavenger receptor CD36 ( 2. 8 + / - 0. 3 - fold, P < 0. 001) but not by increased peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - gamma expression.

High glucose induces MCP - 1 expression partly via tyrosine kinase - AP - 1 pathway in peritoneal mesothelial cells.	[]
BACKGROUND: High glucose in peritoneal dialysis solutions has been implicated in the pathogenesis of peritoneal fibrosis in chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis ( CAPD) patients.	[]
However, the mechanisms are not very clear.	[]
Peritoneal macrophages seem to participate in the process of peritoneal fibrosis and monocyte chemoattractant protein - 1 ( MCP - 1) plays a key role in the recruitment of monocytes toward the peritoneal cavity.

Our findings of distinct signal transducer requirements, with the added consequences of cross - talk, offers an explanation for variable modulation of costimulatory molecule expression in response to diverse physiological stimuli.	[]
Importantly, these results also reveal how concentration threshold barriers for recruitment of individual second messengers can be overcome by constructive convergence of signaling modules.	[]
The role of Epstein - Barr virus in neoplastic transformation.	[]
In this review, we focus on new data from basic, translational and clinical research relating to the Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV).	[]
Beside its well - known tropism for B lymphocytes and epithelial cells, EBV also infects T lymphocytes, monocytes and granulocytes.	[]
After primary infection, EBV persists throughout the life span in resting memory B cells, from where it is reactivated upon breakdown of cellular immunity.	[]
In the process of neoplastic transformation, the EBV - encoded latent membrane protein 1 ( LMP1) oncogene represents the major driving force.	[]
LMP1 acts like a constitutively activated receptor of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family and allows the amplification or bypassing of physiological regulatory signals through direct and indirect interactions with proteins of the tumor necrosis factor receptor - associated factor ( TRAF) family.

The ability of LMP1 to suppress germinal center formation and its capacity to mediate its own transcriptional activation shed new light on the pathogenesis of EBV - associated latency type II lymphoproliferations like Hodgkin ' s disease and angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy.

The ability of interferon ( IFN) - alpha to induce autoimmunity and exacerbate Th1 diseases is well known.	[]
We have recently described enhanced expression of IFN - alpha in the mucosa of patients with celiac disease ( CD), a gluten - sensitive Th1 - mediated enteropathy, characterized by villous atrophy and crypt cell hyperplasia.

Previous studies from this laboratory have shown that T cell activation in explant cultures of human fetal gut can also result in villous atrophy and crypt cell hyperplasia.	[]
We have, therefore, examined changes that take place in explant cultures of human fetal gut after activation of T cells with anti - CD3 and / or IFN - alpha.

We show that activation of T cells with anti - CD3 alone elicits a small IFN - gamma and TNF - alpha response with no tissue injury.

METHODS: Human monocytes were stimulated with Escherichia coli LPS ( 100 ng / ml) with and without forskolin ( FSK, 50 microM) or dibutyryl cyclic AMP ( dbcAMP, 100 microM).	[]
Cytokine ( TNF - alpha and IL - 10) release was measured by immunoassay.

In the present study, we demonstrated that BMP - 2 activated the mouse p21 ( CIP1 / WAF1) promoter in HS - 72 cells, and that a 29 - base pair ( b) region of the promoter ( - 1928 / - 1900 relative to the TATA box), conserved between mice and humans, was responsive to BMP - 2 as well as expression of Smad1, Smad4, and constitutively active mutants of BMP type I receptors.

Furthermore, an oligonucleotide containing the 29 - b region was found to be associated with Smad4 and phosphorylated Smad1 in the nuclear extract of BMP - 2 - stimulated HS - 72 cells.

Dendritic cell development from common myeloid progenitors.	[]
Dendritic cells ( DCs) are professional antigen - presenting cells which both initiate adaptive immune responses and control tolerance to self - antigens.	"self - antigens	138	153	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""self - antigens"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
It has been suggested that these different effects on responder cells depend on subsets of DCs arising from either myeloid or lymphoid hematopoietic origins.	[]
In this model, CD8 alpha + Mac - 1 - DCs are supposed to be of lymphoid while CD8 alpha - Mac - 1 + DCs are supposed to be of myeloid origin.	[]
Here we summarize our findings that both CD8 alpha + and CD8 alpha - DCs can arise from clonogenic common myeloid progenitors ( CMPs) in both thymus and spleen.	[]
Therefore CD8 alpha expression DCs does not indicate a lymphoid origin and differences among CD8 alpha + and CD8 alpha - DCs might rather reflect maturation status than ontogeny.

On the basis of transplantation studies, it seems likely that most of the DCs in secondary lymphoid organs and a substantial fraction of thymic DCs are myeloid - derived.	[]

Hepatic ischemia - reperfusion injury.	[]
BACKGROUND: The morbidity associated with liver transplantation and major hepatic resections is partly a result of ischemia - reperfusion injury.	[]

CONCLUSIONS: An imbalance between endothelin and nitric oxide levels results in failure of the hepatic microcirculation at the onset of reperfusion.	[]
Activation of nuclear factor - kappa B in the liver promotes proinflammatory cytokine and adhesion molecule synthesis.

Dox up - regulated the expression of the TRAIL receptor death receptor 5 ( DR5) and synergistically enhanced the effect of TRAIL not only against MM cells sensitive to, but also against those resistant to, Dex - or Dox - induced apoptosis.

Nuclear factor ( NF) - kappaB inhibitors, such as SN50 ( a cell - permeable inhibitor of the nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of NF - kappaB) or the proteasome inhibitor PS - 341, enhanced the proapoptotic activity of TRAIL / Apo2L against TRAIL - sensitive MM cells, whereas SN50 reversed the TRAIL resistance of ARH - 77 and IM - 9 MM cells.

CD28 costimulation is required not only to induce IL - 12 receptor but also to render janus kinases / STAT4 responsive to IL - 12 stimulation in TCR - triggered T cells.

The activation of resting T cells for the acquisition of various functions depends on whether CD28 costimulatory signals are provided upon T cell receptor stimulation.	[]

When T cells are stimulated with low doses of anti - CD3 mAb, CD28 costimulation was required for the optimal levels of IL - 12 receptor ( IL - 12R) expression.

However, stimulation of T cells with high doses of anti - CD3 alone induced comparable levels of IL - 12R expression to those induced upon CD28 costimulation.

Nevertheless, there was a substantial difference in IL - 12 responsiveness between these two groups of T cells: compared to anti - CD28 - costimulated T cells, T cells that were not costimulated with anti - CD28 exhibited decreased levels of Janus kinases ( JAK) JAK2 / TYK2 and STAT4 phosphorylation and IFN - y production following IL - 12 stimulation.

Akt - 1 was constitutively activated in human macrophages and addition of the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, suppressed the activation of Akt - 1 and induced cell death.

Furthermore, suppression of Akt - 1 by inhibition of PI3K or a dominant negative ( DN) Akt - 1 resulted in loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, activation of caspases - 9 and - 3, and DNA fragmentation.

However, after inhibition of the PI3K / Akt - 1 pathway, a marked decrease in the expression of the antiapoptotic molecule Mcl - 1, but not other Bcl - 2 family members was observed, and Mcl - 1 rescued macrophages from LY294002 - induced cell death.

GRbeta expression in nasal polyp inflammatory cells and its relationship to the anti - inflammatory effects of intranasal fluticasone.	[]
BACKGROUND: Nasal polyposis disease is an inflammatory disorder with intense eosinophilic infiltration of respiratory mucosa that is often difficult to control with topical steroids.	[]
Recent evidence suggests that overexpression of the glucocorticoid receptor splice variant GRbeta in inflammatory cells might contribute to steroid insensitivity in diseases such as asthma.

METHODS: Biopsies were obtained from 10 subjects with NPs before and 4 weeks after treatment with intranasal FP.	[]
Middle turbinates biopsies from 6 healthy, nonallergic subjects served as normal controls.	[]

The percentage of inflammatory cells expressing GRbeta was also increased ( 40. 5% + / - 19. 2% vs 16. 1% + / - 4. 0%, P =. 009).	"GRbeta	48	54	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GRbeta"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

NPs that were ` ` FP - insensitive ' ' in terms of suppression of eosinophil numbers ( major basic protein - positive) had a significantly greater percentage of GRbeta - positive inflammatory cells, a higher ratio of GRbeta - positive / GRalpha - positive cells, and increased numbers of GRbeta - positive eosinophils and macrophages in comparison with those that were ` ` FP - sensitive.

Role of the stroma in mammary development.	[]
Mammary development depends on branching morphogenesis, namely the bifurcation and extension of ductal growth points ( end buds) and secretory lobules into a more or less fatty stroma.	[]
Because breast carcinomas are overwhelmingly ductal in origin, this review focuses on stromal influences guiding postnatal ductal development and there is only the briefest account of the role of embryonic stroma ( mesenchyme).	[]
The stroma as the necessary target for endocrine mammogens and the source of stimulatory growth factors is described and the importance of mammary epithelium - induced modifications of the periductal stroma is emphasized.	[]
Evidence is presented that if they are to grow, end buds must condition proximal fatty stroma by recruiting white blood cells as well as inducing stromal cell division and, possibly, estrogen receptors.

In melanoma cell lines, two different patterns of MHC class II expression have been described, either an IFN gamma - inducible expression of HLA - DR and HLA - DP, with a faint or null expression of HLA - DQ, resembling that described for melanocytes, or a constitutive expression, i. e., IFN - gamma independent, of all three HLA - D isotypes.

As this latter phenotype has been associated with a more rapid progression of melanoma tumors, we have analyzed in different melanoma cell lines the molecular mechanisms leading to this abnormal pattern of MHC class II expression.	[]
In agreement with the evidence of a coordinate transcription of the HLA - D genes in these cell lines, we have shown the constitutive expression of CIITA ( class II transactivator) transcripts, CIITA being known as the master switch of MHC class II expression.

Maturation of human dendritic cells as sulfasalazine target.	[]
AIM: Sulfasalazine, a nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drug, is effective in treating some autoimmune diseases, but its mechanism of action is unclear.	[]
To determine whether dendritic cells could be a possible target of the drug, we studied the effects of sulfasalazine and its metabolites, aminosalicylate and sulfapyridine, on in vitro maturation ( terminal differentiation) of human myeloid dendritic cells.	[]
METHODS: We prepared immature dendritic cells by incubating CD14 - positive cells in the presence of granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor and interleukin ( IL) - 4.

We quantified the effect of drugs on the dendritic cell characteristics, such as stimulation of autologous and allogeneic pan - T cell proliferation, surface marker phenotype, IL - 12 p40 subunit secretion, and activation of nuclear transcription factor ( NF) - kappa B.	[]
RESULTS: Dendritic cells treated with sulfasalazine ( 1. 25 micromol / L or 2. 5 micromol / L) could not stimulate T cells ( p < 0. 028, two - sided paired t - test).	[]
In distinction to drug - free maturing dendritic cells, 2. 5 micromol / L sulfasalazine upregulated the levels of CD14 and CD68 and downregulated the levels of CD40, CD80, and CD83 ( for all CD markers, p < 0. 03 for difference between measurements in the absence and the presence of sulfasalazine).

From concentration - dependent changes in CD83 expression, we found an apparent ID50 > > 1. 5 micromol / L sulfasalazine.	[]
The apparent ID50 value for aminosalicylate - inhibited maturation was 4 micromol / L.	[]
Sulfapyridine had no effect.	[]
At 1. 25 micromol / L, sulfasalazine largely inhibited NF - kB activation in dendritic cells.	[]
CONCLUSION: Maturing human dendritic cells are hundred - fold more sensitive to sulfasalazine than T cells and NK cells and the most sensitive human cells described so far.	[]
Thus, dendritic cell maturation is an important target of sulfasalazine.	[]
Because of the role of dendritic cells in ( auto) immunity, inhibition of their maturation might provide a target for further optimization of sulfasalazine therapy.	[]

As demonstrated by Western blotting, TGF - beta1 reduced the TPO - stimulated ERK1 / ERK2 and STAT5 phosphorylation in Mo - 7e and HEL cells.

This effect was completely reversed by preincubation with a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor ( Na3VO4), which suggests that TGF - beta1 activated a phosphatase.

Although STAT3 also was activated by TPO, STAT3 activation remained unaltered by TGF - beta1.

CONCLUSION: Taken together, these data suggest that TGF - beta1 modulates TPO - mediated effects on megakaryocytic proliferation by interfering with TPO - induced signal transduction, particularly by reducing the activities of MAPK ERK1 / ERK2 and STAT5.

Invariant chain induces B cell maturation by activating a TAF ( II) 105 - NF - kappaB - dependent transcription program.	"Invariant chain	0	15	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Invariant chain"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Early stages of B cell development occur in the bone marrow, resulting in formation of immature B cells.	[]
From there these immature cells migrate to the spleen where they differentiate to mature cells.	[]
This final maturation step is crucial for the B cells to become responsive to antigens and to participate in the immune response.	"antigens	78	86	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""antigens"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Recently, invariant chain ( Ii), a major histocompatibility complex class II chaperone, as well as the transcription factors c - Rel and p65 / RelA, were found to play a role in the final antigen - independent differentiation stage of B cells in the spleen.

Our studies indicate that Ii - induced B cell maturation involves activation of transcription mediated by the NF - kappaB p65 / RelA homodimer and requires the B cell - enriched coactivator TBP - associated factor ( II) 105.

Androgens indirectly accelerate thymocyte apoptosis.	[]
Apoptotic processes, or the disturbance of the natural regulation of these processes, may be involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases ( AID).	[]
Women are, in general, more susceptible than men to develop AID like rheumatoid arthritis.	[]
Androgens and glucocorticoids, in contrast to oestrogens, have favourable effects in AID models as well as in human AID.	[]
It is known that glucocorticoids ( GC), used for treatment of AID, increase apoptosis in the thymus resulting in decreased numbers of CD4 + CD8 + thymocytes.	[]
It was asked whether androgens, in contrast to oestrogens, exert their favourable effects in the treatment of AID by a mechanism comparable to that described for GC by eliminating the apoptosis prone CD4 + CD8 + population in the thymus.	[]
Although both androgens and oestrogens proved thymolytic, a significantly decreased percentage of CD4 + CD8 + thymocytes was observed by flow cytometry after treatment of mice with the androgen methyltestosterone, but not with the oestrogen ethinylestradiol.	[]
To investigate whether the observed thymolytic effects were due to the presence of hormone receptors on thymocytes, cells were isolated from the thymus and incubated with androgens or oestrogens to measure apoptosis.	"hormone receptors	83	100	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""hormone receptors"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Several techniques were used to determine thymocyte apoptosis in vitro, but no enhanced apoptotic signal was observed.	[]
Using the very sensitive TUNEL assay, no direct effect of androgens on thymocytes in vitro could be observed.	[]
This is in sharp contrast to the high signal observed with GC.	[]
Therefore, upon in vivo androgen treatment, other cells containing androgen receptors than thymocytes are probably involved in inducing the increase in thymic apoptosis.	"androgen receptors	67	85	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""androgen receptors"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
To study the role of the androgen receptor on thymocyte apoptosis, androgen receptor mutant ( Tfm / Y) mice were treated with androgens.	"androgen receptor	25	42	Gene/Protein"	"androgen receptor	25	42	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""androgen receptor"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""androgen receptor"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
No alterations of thymocyte subpopulations were seen, suggesting that changes in the percentage of CD4 + CD8 + thymocytes after administration of androgens depend on the presence of functional androgen receptors.

However, enforced expression of ICSBP failed to down - regulate IRF - 1, ISGF3gamma, and p21 ( WAF1).

Thus, the FANCC protein functions to modulate expression of a family of genes that in normal cells are inducible only by specific environmental cues for apoptosis or mitogenic inhibition, but it does so independently of the classic IFN - STAT1 pathway and is not the direct result of reduced ICSBP expression.

A genetic investigation of E2A function in lymphocyte development.	[]
Lymphocytes are derived from hematopoietic stem cells ( HSC) following a series of regulated differentiation events.	[]
Multipotent HSCs become committed to the B cell lineage in bone marrow and the T cell lineage in the thymus after receiving appropriate signals from the corresponding microenvironment.	[]
These committed lymphoid cells must then undergo V ( D) J recombination at the immunoglobulin gene or T cell receptor gene locus resulting in clonal production of functional B or T lymphocytes, respectively.	"immunoglobulin gene	79	98	Gene/Protein"	"T cell receptor gene locus	102	128	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""immunoglobulin gene"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""T cell receptor gene locus"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Lymphocyte commitment and differentiation are accompanied by programmed gene expression or repression events which are driven by lineage and stage specific transcription factors.

The basic - helix - loop - helix ( bHLH) transcription factors encoded by the E2A gene are involved in several differentiation events during B and T cell development, including lineage commitment, initiation of V ( D) J recombination, and antigen receptor mediated proliferation and differentiation.

Several recent reviews have provided a comprehensive discussion of biochemical, cellular, and genetic research on E2A function in lymphocyte development ( 1, 2).	[]
Here, we only discuss some of the genetic approaches our laboratory ( except where it is noted) has undertaken to investigate the molecular pathways mediated by E2A transcription factors in lymphocyte development	"E2A transcription factors	161	186	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""E2A transcription factors"", ""start_span"": 161, ""end_span"": 186, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
D609 inhibits ionizing radiation - induced oxidative damage by acting as a potent antioxidant.	[]
Tricyclodecan - 9 - yl - xanthogenate ( D609) has been extensively studied in biological systems and exhibits a variety of biological functions, including antiviral, antitumor, and anti - inflammatory activities.	[]
Most of these activities have been largely attributed to the inhibitory effect of D609 on phosphatidylcholine - specific phospholipase C.	"phospholipase C	121	136	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""phospholipase C"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
However, as a xanthate derivative, D609 is a strong electrolyte and readily dissociates to xanthate anions and cations of alkali metals in solution.	[]
Xanthate anions and protonated xanthic acid contain a free thiol moiety and are highly reductive.	[]
This implies that D609 and other xanthate derivatives may function as potent antioxidants.	[]
Indeed, we found that D609 inhibited the Fenton reaction - induced oxidation of dihydrorhodamine 123 in a dose - dependent manner similar to that of pyrrolidinedithiocar, a well known antioxidant.	[]
In addition, D609 inhibited the formation of the alpha - phenyl - tert - butylnitrone - free radical spin adducts and lipid peroxidation of synaptosomal membranes by the Fenton reagents.	[]
Furthermore, preincubation of lymphocytes with D609 resulted in a significant diminution of ionizing radiation ( IR) - induced 1) production of reactive oxygen species; 2) decrease in intracellular reduced glutathione; 3) oxidative damage to proteins and lipids; and 4) activation of nuclear factor - kappaB.	"nuclear factor - kappaB	284	307	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""nuclear factor - kappaB"", ""start_span"": 284, ""end_span"": 307, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Moreover, when D609 ( 50 mg / kg i. v.) was administered to mice 10 min prior to total body IR ( 6. 5 and 8. 5 Gy), it protected the mice from IR - induced lethality.	[]
Thus, these results indicate that D609 is a potent antioxidant and has the ability to inhibit IR - induced cellular oxidative stress.	[]
Inhibition of AP - 1 by the glucocorticoid - inducible protein GILZ.

The immunosuppressive effects of glucocorticoids arise largely by inhibition of cytokine gene expression, which has been ascribed to interference between the glucocorticoid receptor and transcription factors such as AP - 1 and NF - kappa B as well as by competition for common coactivators.	"glucocorticoid receptor	158	181	Gene/Protein"	"transcription factors	186	207	Gene/Protein"	"AP - 1	216	222	Gene/Protein"	"NF - kappa B	227	239	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""glucocorticoid receptor"", ""start_span"": 158, ""end_span"": 181, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""transcription factors"", ""start_span"": 186, ""end_span"": 207, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""AP - 1"", ""start_span"": 216, ""end_span"": 222, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""NF - kappa B"", ""start_span"": 227, ""end_span"": 239, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Here we show that glucocorticoid - induced inhibition of interleukin - 2 mRNA expression in activated normal T cells required new protein synthesis, suggesting that this phenomenon is secondary to expression of glucocorticoid - regulated genes.	"genes	238	243	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 238, ""end_span"": 243, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
One of the most prominent glucocorticoid - induced genes is glucocorticoid - induced leucine zipper ( GILZ), which has been reported to inhibit activation - induced up - regulation of Fas ligand ( FasL) mRNA.	"genes	51	56	Gene/Protein"	"glucocorticoid - induced leucine zipper	60	99	Gene/Protein"	"GILZ	102	106	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""genes"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""glucocorticoid - induced leucine zipper"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""GILZ"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Indeed, transient expression of GILZ in Jurkat T cells blocked induction of a reporter construct driven by the FasL promoter.	"GILZ	32	36	Gene/Protein"	"reporter construct	78	96	Gene/Protein"	"FasL promoter	111	124	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GILZ"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""reporter construct"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""FasL promoter"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
This could be accounted for by GILZ - mediated inhibition of Egr - 2 and Egr - 3, NFAT / AP - 1 - inducible transcription factors that bind a regulatory element in the FasL promoter and up - regulate FasL expression.

GILZ also potently inhibited AP - 1 - driven and IL - 2 promoter - driven reporter constructs, and recombinant GILZ specifically interacted with c - Fos and c - Jun in vitro and inhibited the binding of active AP - 1 to its target DNA.

Whereas homodimerization of GILZ required the presence of its leucine zipper, the interaction with c - Fos and c - Jun occurred through the N - terminal 60 - amino acid region of GILZ.	"GILZ	28	32	Gene/Protein"	"leucine zipper	62	76	Gene/Protein"	"c - Fos	99	106	Gene/Protein"	"c - Jun	111	118	Gene/Protein"	"N - terminal	140	152	Gene/Protein"	"60 - amino acid region	153	175	Gene/Protein"	"GILZ	28	32	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GILZ"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""leucine zipper"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""c - Fos"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""c - Jun"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""N - terminal"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""60 - amino acid region"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 175, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""GILZ"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Thus, GILZ represents a glucocorticoid - induced gene product that can inhibit a variety of activation - induced events, at least in part by direct interference with AP - 1, and is therefore a candidate for a mediator of glucocorticoid - induced immunosuppression.

Pharmacokinetic differences between a T cell - tolerizing and a T cell - activating peptide.	[]
Vaccination with a peptide representing a CTL epitope from the human papillomavirus ( HPV) 16 E7 protein induces a specific CTL response that prevents the outgrowth of HPV16 E7 - expressing tumors.	"E7 protein	94	104	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""E7 protein"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In contrast, vaccination with a peptide encoding an adenovirus type 5 ( Ad5) E1A CTL epitope results in CTL tolerance and enhanced growth of an Ad5 E1A - expressing tumor.	[]
It is unclear why these peptides induce such opposite effects.	[]
To determine whether a difference in pharmacokinetics can explain the functional contrasts, tritiated Ad5 E1A and HPV16 E7 peptides were injected into mice.	[]
Results show that the tolerizing peptide spread through the body 16 times faster than the activating peptide and was cleared at least 2 times faster.	[]
The HPV16 E7 peptide kinetics correlated with the kinetics of HPV16 E7 - specific CTL induction.	"HPV16 E7	4	12	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""HPV16 E7"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In contrast, Ad5 E1A peptide injection resulted in physical deletion of preexisting Ad5 E1A - specific CTLs within 24 h after injection.

This tolerization occurred at the time when the peptide reached its maximum peptide concentration in the organs.	[]
These data suggest that ubiquitous expression of the tolerizing Ad5 E1A peptide within a short period of time causes activation - induced cell death of Ad5 E1A - specific CTLs.

Even more, coexpression of a dominant negative version of NFAT inhibited Cot kinase - mediated COX - 2 promoter activation, whereas cotransfection of a constitutively active version of the calcium - dependent phosphatase calcineurin synergizes with Cot kinase in the up - regulation of COX - 2 promoter - driven transcription.

We show in this study, using TCF - 1 beta ( 2) - microglobulin double - deficient mice, that these repertoire alterations are not due to Ly - 49 / MHC class I interactions.	[]

Besides reduced receptor usage ( Ly - 49A and D), we also observed no effect ( Ly - 49C) and significantly expanded ( Ly - 49G and I) receptor usage in the absence of TCF - 1.

Because the promoters of these chemokine genes contain kappaB binding sites, we assessed the possible role of nuclear factor - kappaB ( NF - kappaB) in controlling induction of the genes through beta ( 2) integrin engagement.

Blockade of depletion of IkappaB - alpha by proteasome inhibitors ( proteasome inhibitor I or acetyl - leucinyl - leucinyl - norleucinal) led to concomitant inhibition of NF - kappaB DNA - binding activity and expression of MIP - 1alpha and MIP - 1beta messenger RNA induced by beta ( 2) integrin ligation.

These results suggest that triggering of CD11b or CD11c beta ( 2) integrin on primary human monocytes provides activation signals leading to nuclear translocation of NF - kappaB and subsequent secretion of MIP - 1alpha and MIP - 1beta that may have an important role in recruitment of other inflammatory cells during initiation of an inflammatory response	"CD11b	41	46	Gene/Protein"	"NF - kappaB	166	177	Gene/Protein"	"MIP - 1alpha	206	218	Gene/Protein"	"MIP - 1beta	223	234	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CD11b"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""NF - kappaB"", ""start_span"": 166, ""end_span"": 177, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""MIP - 1alpha"", ""start_span"": 206, ""end_span"": 218, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""MIP - 1beta"", ""start_span"": 223, ""end_span"": 234, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

Inhaled nitric oxide down - regulates intrapulmonary nitric oxide production in lipopolysaccharide - induced acute lung injury.	[]
OBJECTIVE: To examine whether inhaled nitric oxide ( NO) affected the intrapulmonary production of NO, reactive oxygen species, and nuclear factor - kappaB in a lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) - induced model of acute lung injury.

DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, laboratory study.	[]
SETTING: Experimental laboratory at a biomedical institute.	[]
SUBJECTS: Twenty male rabbits weighing 2. 5 - 3. 5 kg.	[]
INTERVENTIONS: Saline or LPS ( 5 mg / kg of body weight) was administered intravenously with or without NO inhalation ( 10 ppm) in each group of five rabbits.	[]
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: LPS increased the lung leak index, the neutrophils and NO levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and NO levels produced by resting and stimulated alveolar macrophages.	[]
Inhaled NO decreased the lung leak index, the neutrophils and NO levels as measured by nitrite levels in the lavage fluid, and NO produced by the resting and stimulated alveolar macrophages.	[]
Inhaled NO also blocked the activities of reactive oxygen species and nuclear factor - kappaB binding to DNA in lavage cells and in alveolar macrophages.

The mechanism of reducing NO production resulting from inhaled NO may involve, in part, the activities of reactive oxygen species and / or nuclear factor - kappaB.

Recent studies in transgenic mice have revealed that expression of a dominant negative form of the transcription factor GATA - 3 in T cells can prevent T helper cell type 2 ( Th2) - mediated allergic airway inflammation in mice.

However, it remains unclear whether GATA - 3 plays a role in the effector phase of allergic airway inflammation and whether antagonizing the expression and / or function of GATA - 3 can be used for the therapy of allergic airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness.

We could suppress GATA - 3 expression in interleukin ( IL) - 4 - producing T cells in vitro and in vivo by an antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotide overlapping the translation start site of GATA - 3, whereas nonsense control oligonucleotides were virtually inactive.

In a murine model of asthma associated with allergic pulmonary inflammation and hyperresponsiveness in ovalbumin ( OVA) - sensitized mice, local intranasal administration of fluorescein isothiocyanate - labeled GATA - 3 antisense oligonucleotides led to DNA uptake in lung cells associated with a reduction of intracellular GATA - 3 expression.	[]
Such intrapulmonary blockade of GATA - 3 expression caused an abrogation of signs of lung inflammation including infiltration of eosinophils and Th2 cytokine production.	[]
Furthermore, treatment with antisense but not nonsense oligonucleotides induced a significant reduction of airway hyperresponsiveness in OVA - sensitized mice to levels comparable to saline - treated control mice, as assessed by both enhanced pause ( PenH) responses and pulmonary resistance determined by body plethysmography.	[]
These data indicate a critical role for GATA - 3 in the effector phase of a murine asthma model and suggest that local delivery of GATA - 3 antisense oligonucleotides may be a novel approach for the treatment of airway hyperresponsiveness such as in asthma.

T helper - cell phenotype regulates atherosclerosis in mice under conditions of mild hypercholesterolemia.	[]
BACKGROUND: T cells are implicated in atherosclerosis, but little is known about the genetic control or molecular pathways, especially under conditions of mild hypercholesterolemia.	[]
METHODS AND RESULTS: BALB / c mice, making a CD4 + Th2 ( IL - 4 +) cell response, express both MHC class II antigens ( IA ( d), IE ( d)) and are atherosclerosis - resistant.

To evaluate T helper - cell phenotype in fatty streak formation, wild - type C57Bl / 6 mice ( IA ( b) + IE -) and transgenic mice, either AB ( o), IA ( b) - IE -; ABEalpha, IA - IE ( k) +; or BL: TG: Ealpha, IA ( b) + IE ( k) +, were fed a high - cholesterol diet for 16 weeks and evaluated histomorphometricall for aortic lesions.	[]
Lesion size in AB ( o), ABEalpha, and BL: TG: Ealpha strains was decreased by 54%, 79%, and 82%, respectively, compared with wild - type, correlating with decreased Th1 and increased Th2 expression and suggesting that T helper - cell phenotype is important in fatty lesion development.	[]
Decreasing Th1 cells by antibodies ( alpha - CD4) or cytokines ( IL - 4) also caused > / = 80% reductions in lesion size.

Stepwise lineage restriction of progenitors in lympho - myelopoiesis.	[]
It has long been controversial whether hematopoiesis progresses through ordered stages of determination as in embryonic development.	[]
This is due to the absence of a methodology capable of exactly determining the developmental potential of hematopoietic stem / progenitor cells.	[]
The multilineage progenitor ( MLP) assay enabled us to discriminate among seven types of hematopoietic progenitors, which are multipotent progenitor p - MTB ( capable of generating myeloid, T and B cells), bipotent progenitors p - MT, p - MB and p - TB, and unipotent progenitors p - M, p - T and p - B.	[]
Among these seven types, the p - TB type progenitor was found to be absent.	[]
These findings indicate that the process of lineage commitment proceeds through an ordered but not random process.	[]
By extending the area of investigation to include the erythroid lineage, more convincing evidence for the ordered process was obtained.	[]

Regulation of cytokine production in T - cell responses to inhalant allergen: GATA - 3 expression distinguishes between Th1 - and Th2 - polarized immunity.	"GATA - 3	78	86	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GATA - 3"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
BACKGROUND: The precise nature of allergen - specific cytokine responses in atopics versus non - atopics, in particular the ' Th1 polarity ' of responses in non - atopics, remains controversial.	[]
This is due in part to the relative insensitivity of cytokine detection systems, and associated variations in kinetics of cytokine production and catabolism in in vitro culture systems.	[]
As an alternative to cytokine measurement, this study focuses on expression of the transcription factor GATA - 3 for analysis of allergen - specific Th cell responses.	"transcription factor GATA - 3	83	112	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""transcription factor GATA - 3"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
METHODS: Cord blood mononuclear cells were Th1 - or Th2 - polarized by culture in IL - 12 - or IL - 4 - employing established methods; PBMC from house dust mite ( HDM) - sensitive atopics and controls were stimulated overnight with HDM; cytokine production was measured by ELISA and GATA - 3 mRNA expression by PCR.	"GATA - 3 mRNA	283	296	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GATA - 3 mRNA"", ""start_span"": 283, ""end_span"": 296, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
RESULTS: Cytokine - driven Th2 polarization of naive T cells is associated with marked upregulation of GATA - 3 expression, whereas a reciprocal expression pattern accompanies differentiation towards the Th1 cytokine phenotype.	"Cytokine	9	17	Gene/Protein"	"GATA - 3	103	111	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Cytokine"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""GATA - 3"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In T cells from HDM skin prick test - positive ( HDM - SPT + / HDM - IgE +) volunteers, overnight stimulation results in marked upregulation of GATA - 3 expression, compared to an equally marked downregulation of expression in T cells from SPT - / IgE - subjects.	"GATA - 3	144	152	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GATA - 3"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In subjects who are HDM - SPT + but IgE -, GATA - 3 expression levels remained relatively stable during culture with HDM.	"GATA - 3	43	51	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GATA - 3"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
CONCLUSIONS: Upregulation of GATA - 3 expression in PBMC is a hallmark of the early phase of Th2 recall responses to specific allergen in atopics.	"GATA - 3	29	37	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GATA - 3"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The reciprocal expression pattern observed in HDM - specific recall responses of non - atopics provides independent confirmation of the presence of underlying Th1 - like immunity in these subjects.	[]
The parallel findings in neonatal T cells suggest that the same approach may be utilized for monitoring the progress of allergen - specific Th1 / Th2 memory development during early childhood, and hence in assessment of risk for future allergic disease.	[]

The stress response ( SR) can block inflammatory gene expression by preventing activation of transcription factor nuclear factor - kappa B ( NF - kappaB).

As inflammatory gene expression contributes to the pathogenesis of demyelinating diseases, we tested the effects of the SR on the progression of the demyelinating disease experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( EAE).	[]
EAE was actively induced in C57BL / 6 mice using an encephalitogenic myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein ( MOG ( 35 - 55)) peptide.

Whole body hyperthermia was used to induce a heat shock response ( HSR) in immunized mice 2 days after the booster MOG ( 35 - 55) peptide injection.	[]
The HSR reduced the incidence of EAE by 70%, delayed disease onset by 6 days, and attenuated disease severity.	[]
The HSR attenuated leukocyte infiltration into CNS assessed by quantitation of perivascular infiltrates, and by reduced staining for CD4 and CD25 immunopositive T - cells.

T - cell activation, assessed by the production of interferon gamma ( IFNgamma) in response to MOG ( 35 - 55), was also decreased by the HSR.

The HSR reduced inflammatory gene expression in the brain that normally occurs during EAE, including the early increase in RANTES ( regulated on activation of normal T - cell expressed and secreted) expression, and the later expression of the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase.

The early activation of transcription factor NF - kappaB was also blocked by the HSR.

The finding that the SR reduces inflammation in the brain and the clinical severity of EAE opens a novel therapeutic approach for prevention of autoimmune diseases.	[]
In vivo detection of intracellular signaling pathways in developing thymocytes.	[]
Information regarding the intracellular signaling processes that occur during the development of T cells has largely been obtained with the use of transgenic mouse models, which although providing invaluable information are time consuming and costly.	[]
To this end, we have developed a novel system that facilitates the in vivo analysis of signal transduction pathways during T - lymphocyte development.	[]
This approach uses reporter - plasmids for the detection of intracellular signals mediated by the mitogen - activated protein kinase or cyclic AMP - dependent protein kinase.	"reporter - plasmids	19	38	Gene/Protein"	"mitogen - activated protein kinase	98	132	Gene/Protein"	"cyclic AMP - dependent protein kinase	136	173	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""reporter - plasmids"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""mitogen - activated protein kinase"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""cyclic AMP - dependent protein kinase"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Reporter - plasmids are transfected into thymocytes in fetal thymic organ culture by accelerated DNA / particle bombardment ( gene gun), and the activation of a signaling pathway is determined in the form of a standard luciferase assay.	"Reporter - plasmids	0	19	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Reporter - plasmids"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Importantly, this powerful technique preserves the structural integrity of the thymus, and will provide an invaluable tool to study how thymocytes respond to normal environmental stimuli encountered during differentiation within the thymic milieu.	[]
Thus, this method allows for the monitoring of signals that occur in a biological time frame, such as during differentiation, and within the natural environment of differentiating cells.	[]

Homozygous disruption of either the Runx1 or Cbfb gene in mice results in embryonic lethality at midgestation due to hemorrhaging in the central nervous system, and severely impairs fetal liver hematopoiesis.

Definitive hematopoiesis is restored by ectopic expression of full - length Cbfb transgenes, as well as by a transgene encoding only the heterodimerization domain of CBFbeta.

At 6 weeks after beginning the dosing, the hprt mutant frequency in spleen lymphocytes from the four - dose group was 16. 5 x 10 ( - 6) compared with 3. 2 x 10 ( - 6) in control animals.	[]
Also at 6 weeks, rats given one, two, or four doses of N - OH - AAF had lacI mutant frequencies in the liver of 97. 6, 155. 6, and 406. 8 x 10 ( - 6), respectively, compared with a control frequency of 25. 7 x 10 ( - 6); rats given four doses had lacI mutant frequencies in spleen lymphocytes of 55. 8 x 10 ( - 6) compared with a control frequency of 20. 4 x 10 ( - 6).	[]
Additional rats were evaluated for DNA adduct formation in the liver, spleen lymphocytes, and bone marrow by ( 32) P - postlabeling.	[]
Adduct analysis was conducted 1 day after one, two, and four treatments with N - OH - AAF, 5 days after one treatment, and 9 days after two treatments.	[]
N - ( Deoxyguanosin - 8 - yl) - 2 - aminofluorene was the major DNA adduct identified in all the tissues examined.	[]
Adduct concentrations increased with total dose to maximum values in samples taken 1 day after two doses, and remained essentially the same after four doses.	[]
In samples taken after four doses, adduct levels were 103, 28, and 7 fmol / microg of DNA in liver, spleen lymphocytes, and bone marrow, respectively.	[]
The results indicate that the extent of both DNA adduct formation and mutant induction correlates with the organ specificity for N - OH - AAF carcinogenesis in the rat.	[]

Expression of Mad1 in T cells leads to reduced thymic cellularity and impaired mitogen - induced proliferation.	"Mad1	14	18	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Mad1"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
To investigate Mad1 function in vivo, transgenic mice were generated that express a Mad1 transgene in T lineage cells under the control of the proximal lck promoter.

Thymus size in lck - Mad1 transgenic mice is drastically reduced although representation of the various thymocyte sub populations appears normal.	[]
To investigate more closely any effects of Mad1 expression on thymocytes, we examined thymic selection using MHC class I - restricted H - Y - TCR transgenic mice.	[]
Mad1 expression in vivo reduces the efficiency of positive selection.	[]
Furthermore, thymocytes and splenic T cells from lck - Mad1 transgenic mice display a profound proliferative defect in response to activation with either PMA / Ionomycin or immobilized anti - CD3 / CD28 antibody.

Differential requirement for the transcription factor PU. 1 in the generation of natural killer cells versus B and T cells.	[]
PU. 1 is a member of the Ets family of transcription factors required for the development of various lymphoid and myeloid cell lineages, but its role in natural killer ( NK) cell development is not known.	"Ets family of transcription factors	25	60	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Ets family of transcription factors"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The study shows that PU. 1 is expressed in NK cells and that, on cell transfer into alymphoid Rag2 / gammac ( - / -) mice, hematopoietic progenitors of PU. 1 ( - / -) fetal liver cells could generate functional NK cells but not B or T cells.	[]
Nevertheless, the numbers of bone marrow NK cell precursors and splenic mature NK cells were reduced compared to controls.	[]
Moreover, PU. 1 ( - / -) NK cells displayed reduced expression of the receptors for stem cell factor and interleukin ( IL) - 7, suggesting a nonredundant role for PU. 1 in regulating the expression of these cytokine receptor genes during NK cell development.	"stem cell factor	84	100	Gene/Protein"	"cytokine receptor genes	207	230	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""stem cell factor"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""cytokine receptor genes"", ""start_span"": 207, ""end_span"": 230, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
PU. 1 ( - / -) NK cells also showed defective expression of inhibitory and activating members of the Ly49 family and failed to proliferate in response to IL - 2 and IL - 12.

Thus, despite the less stringent requirement for PU. 1 in NK cell development compared to B and T cells, PU. 1 regulates NK cell differentiation and homeostasis.	[]
Benzene - extracted components are important for the major activity of diesel exhaust particles: effect on interleukin - 8 gene expression in human bronchial epithelial cells.

To better understand the mechanisms of their proinflammatory activities, we studied the effects of several components extracted from DEPs on interleukin ( IL) - 8 expression in human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS - 2B and normal human airway epithelial cells obtained from very peripheral airways by an ultrathin bronchoscope.	[]
We used several agents active on signal transduction pathways in cytokine expression, such as the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporin, antioxidant agents including N - acetyl cysteine ( NAC) and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC), and p38 mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK) inhibitor SB203580.

Benzene - extracted components showed effects mimicking DEPs on IL - 8 gene expression, release of several cytokines ( IL - 8; granulocyte macrophage colony - stimulating factor; and regulated on activation, normal T cells expressed and secreted) and nuclear factor ( NF) - kappa B activation.

Little is known, however, about the functions of PPAR - gamma in the immune system, especially in T lymphocytes.	"PPAR - gamma	49	61	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PPAR - gamma"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
We demonstrate that both naive and activated ovalbumin - specific T cells from DO11. 10 - transgenic mice express PPAR - gamma mRNA and protein.	"PPAR - gamma	114	126	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PPAR - gamma"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In order to determine the function of PPAR - gamma, T cells were stimulated with phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate and ionomycin or antigen and antigen - presenting cells.	"PPAR - gamma	38	50	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PPAR - gamma"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Simultaneous exposure to PPAR - gamma ligands ( e. g. 15 - deoxy - Delta ( 12, 14) - prostaglandin J ( 2), troglitazone) showed drastic inhibition of proliferation and significant decreases in cell viability.	[]
The decrease in cell viability was due to apoptosis of the T lymphocytes, and occurred only when cells were treated with PPAR - gamma, and not PPAR - alpha agonists, revealing specificity of this response for PPAR - gamma.

These observations suggest that PPAR - gamma agonists play an important role in regulating T cell - mediated immune responses by inducing apoptosis.	[]
T cell death via PPAR - gamma ligation may act as a potent anti - inflammatory signal in the immune system, and ligands could possibly be used to control disorders in which excessive inflammation occurs.	[]
Suppression of lung inflammation in rats by prevention of NF - kappaB activation in the liver.	[]

We hypothesized that inhibition of proteasome function with CI - 1 would block NF - kappaB activation in vivo after intraperitoneal ( i. p.) treatment with bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS), and that NF - kappaB inhibition would be associated with suppression of chemokine gene expression and attenuation of neutrophilic alveolitis.	[]
We treated rats with a single i. p. injection of CI - 1 ( 10 mg / kg) two hours prior to i. p. LPS ( 7 mg / kg).	[]
Treatment with Cl - 1 prevented degradation of IkappaB - alpha and activation of NF - kappaB in the liver in response to LPS; however, Cl - 1 treatment had no detected effect on NF - kappaB activation in lung tissue.

CI - 1 treatment prior to LPS resulted in 40% lower MIP - 2 concentration in lung lavage fluid compared to rats treated with vehicle prior to LPS ( 502 + / - 112 pg / ml vs. 859 + / - 144 pg / ml, P < 0. 05).	[]
In addition, CI - 1 treatment substantially inhibited LPS - induced neutrophilic alveolitis ( 2. 7 + / - 1. 2 x 10 ( 5) vs. 43. 7 + / - 12. 2 x 10 ( 5) lung lavage neutrophils, P < 0. 01).	[]
These data indicate that NF - kappaB inhibition in the liver can alter lung inflammation induced by systemic LPS treatment and suggest that a liver - lung interaction contributes to the inflammatory response of the lung.	[]

Here, we demonstrate that engineered down - regulation of HIF - 1alpha by intratumoral gene transfer of an antisense HIF - 1alpha plasmid leads to the down - regulation of VEGF, and decreased tumor microvessel density.

Antisense HIF - 1alpha monotherapy resulted in the complete and permanent rejection of small ( 0. 1 cm in diameter) EL - 4 tumors, which is unusual for an anti - angiogenic agent where transient suppression of tumor growth is the norm.	[]
It induced NK cell - dependent rejection of tumors, but failed to stimulate systemic T cell - mediated anti - tumor immunity, and synergized with B7 - 1 - mediated immunotherapy to cause the NK cell and CD8 T cell - dependent rejection of larger EL - 4 tumors ( 0. 4 cm in diameter) that were refractory to monotherapies.	[]
Mice cured of their tumors by combination therapy resisted a rechallenge with parental tumor cells, indicating systemic antitumor immunity had been achieved.	[]
In summary, whilst intensive investigations are in progress to target the many HIF - 1 effectors, the results herein indicate that blocking hypoxia - inducible pathways and enhancing NK - mediated antitumor immunity by targeting HIF - 1 itself may be advantageous, especially when combined with cancer immunotherapy.

The Runx2 ( Cbfa1, Pebp2alphaA, Aml3) gene was previously identified as a frequent target for transcriptional activation by proviral insertion in T - cell lymphomas of CD2 - MYC transgenic mice.

We have recently shown that over - expression of the full - length, most highly expressed Runx2 isoform in the thymus perturbs T - cell development, leads to development of spontaneous lymphomas at low frequency and is strongly synergistic with Myc.

To gain further insight into the relationship of Runx2 to other lymphomagenic pathways, we tested the effect of combining the CD2 - Runx2 transgene either with a Pim1 transgene ( E ( mu) - Pim1) or with the p53 null genotype, as each of these displays independent synergy with Myc.

In both cases we observed synergistic tumour development.	[]
However, Runx2 appeared to have a dominant effect on the tumour phenotype in each case, with most tumours conforming to the CD3 ( +), CD8 ( +), CD4 ( + / -) phenotype seen in CD2 - Runx2 mice.

Neonatal infection of CD2 - Runx2 mice with Moloney murine leukaemia virus ( Moloney MLV) also led to a dramatic acceleration of tumour onset.	[]

Dendritic cells ( DCs), besides their role as APCs, now have been demonstrated to exert cytotoxicity or cytostasis on some tumor cells.	[]
Here, we report that both human CD34 ( +) stem cell - derived DCs ( CD34DCs) and human CD14 ( +) monocyte - derived DCs ( MoDCs) express TRAIL and exhibit cytotoxicity to some types of tumor cells partially through TRAIL.	[]
Moderate expression of TRAIL appeared on CD34DCs from the 8th day of culture and was also seen on freshly isolated monocytes.	[]
The level of TRAIL expression remained constant until DC maturation.	[]
TRAIL expression on immature CD34DCs or MoDCs was greatly up - regulated after IFN - beta stimulation.	"IFN - beta	79	89	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IFN - beta"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Moreover, IFN - beta could strikingly enhance the ability of CD34DCs or MoDCs to kill TRAIL - sensitive tumor cells, but LPS did not have such an effect.	"IFN - beta	10	20	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IFN - beta"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The up - regulation of TRAIL on IFN - beta - stimulated DCs partially contributed to the increased cytotoxicity of DCS: Pretreatment of TRAIL - sensitive tumor cells with caspase - 3 inhibitor could significantly increase their resistance to the cytotoxicity of IFN - beta - stimulated DCS: In contrast, NF - kappaB inhibitor could significantly increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to the killing by nonstimulated or LPS - stimulated DCS: Our studies demonstrate that IFN - beta - stimulated DCs are functionally cytotoxic.

Thus, an innate mechanism of DC - mediated antitumor immunity might exist in vivo in which DCs act as effectors to directly kill tumor cells partially via TRAIL.	[]
Subsequently, DCs act as APCs involved in the uptake, processing, and presentation of apoptotic tumor Ags to cross - prime CD8 ( +) CTL cells.	"apoptotic tumor Ags	86	105	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""apoptotic tumor Ags"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Tumor cells regulate the lytic activity of tumor - specific cytotoxic t lymphocytes by modulating the inhibitory natural killer receptor function.	[]
Tumor - infiltrating p58 + T cells from a renal tumor were specifically expanded in response to tumor cell stimulation and cloned.	[]
These p58 + T cells were found to express a memory phenotype and corresponded to clonal TCRBV3 T - cell expansion.	[]
Functionally, p58 ( +) CTLs displayed a low lytic activity for HLA - A2 tumor and normal cells.	[]
However, this lytic activity was significantly increased after blockade of p58 with specific monoclonal antibodies.

Interestingly, we demonstrated that stimulation by tumor cells was required to trigger the inhibitory effect of p58 on the lytic activity of antigen - specific CTLs and that stimulation of the inhibitory function of p58 by tumor cells correlated with an inhibition of nuclear factor - kappaB activation in p58 + tumor - specific CTLS.

To better understand the developmental link between natural killer ( NK) cells derived from progenitors, we studied NK cell subsets circulating in blood.	[]

The TCF - 1 isoform found in CD56 ( + bright) cells, which express lectin but not immunoglobulin class I recognizing inhibitory receptors, was identical to that induced in NK cell differentiation culture and was distinctly different from isoforms in T cells.

Similar to transmembrane PTP, CD45, the membrane - associated populations of SHP - 1 and SHP - 2 are essentially excluded from lipid rafts, where other signaling molecules such as Lck, linker for activation of T cells, and CD3 zeta are enriched.

Although interleukin ( IL) - 12 and IL - 4 polarize naive CD4 ( +) T cells toward T helper cell type 1 ( Th1) or Th2 phenotypes, it is not known whether cytokines instruct the developmental fate in uncommitted progenitors or select for outgrowth of cells that have stochastically committed to a particular fate.

To distinguish these instructive and selective models, we used surface affinity matrix technology to isolate committed progenitors based on cytokine secretion phenotype and developed retroviral - based tagging approaches to directly monitor individual progenitor fate decisions at the clonal and population levels.

Further, retroviral tagging of naive progenitors with the Th2 - specific transcription factor GATA - 3 provided direct evidence for instructive differentiation, and no evidence for the selective outgrowth of cells committed to either the Th1 or Th2 fate.

Although serine phosphorylation has been shown to induce ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome - mediated degradation of I kappa B - alpha, little is known about the mechanisms that lead to release of active NF - kappa B in T cells as a consequence of tyrosine phosphorylation of I kappa B - alpha [ Imbert, V., Rupec, R. A., Livolsi, A., Pahl, H. L., Traenckner, B. M., Mueller - Dieckmann, C., Farahifar, D., Rossi, B., Auberger, P., Baeuerle, P. & Peyron, J. F. ( 1996) Cell 86, 787 - - 798].

The involvement of the tyrosine kinases p56 ( lck) and ZAP - 70 in this reaction is demonstrated here using specific pharmacological inhibitors and Jurkat mutants unable to express these kinases.

Although the inhibitors prevented both pervanadate - induced phosphorylation of I kappa B - alpha on Tyr42 and NF - kappa B activation, we observed that, in p56 ( lck) - deficient Jurkat mutants, NF - kappa B could still associate with I kappa B - alpha despite phosphorylation on Tyr42.

Furthermore, the SH2 domain of p56 ( lck) appeared to be required for pervanadate - induced NF - kappa B activation but not for Tyr42 phosphorylation.

These results show that p56 ( lck) and ZAP - 70 are key components of the signaling pathway that leads to phosphotyrosine - dependent NF - kappa B activation in T cells and confirm that tyrosine kinases must control at least two different steps to induce activation of NF - kappa B.

These mutations prevent CD40 ligand ( CD40L) - mediated degradation of inhibitor of NF - kappaB alpha ( IkappaB - alpha) and account for the following observations: B cells from XHM - ED patients are unable to undergo immunoglobulin class - switch recombination and antigen - presenting cells ( APCs) are unable to synthesize the NF - kappaB - regulated cytokines interleukin 12 ( IL - 12) or tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF - alpha) when stimulated with CD40L.

Nevertheless, innate immunity is preserved in XHM - ED patients because APCs retain the capacity to respond to stimulation by lipopolysaccharide or Staphylococcus aureus Cowan ' s antigen ( SAC).

Granulocytic differentiation of human NB4 promyelocytic leukemia cells induced by all - trans retinoic acid metabolites.	[]
The metabolism of all - trans retinoic acid ( ATRA) has been reported to be partly responsible for the in vivo resistance to ATRA seen in the treatment of human acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL).	[]
However, ATRA metabolism appears to be involved in the growth inhibition of several cancer cell lines in vitro.	[]
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of the principal metabolites of ATRA [ 4 - hydroxy - retinoic acid ( 4 - OH - RA), 18 - hydroxy - retinoic acid ( 18 - OH - RA), 4 - oxo - retinoic acid ( 4 - oxo - RA), and 5, 6 - epoxy - retinoic acid ( 5, 6 - epoxy - RA)] in NB4, a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line that exhibits the APL diagnostic t ( 15; 17) chromosomal translocation and expresses the PML - RAR alpha fusion protein.

We established that the four ATRA metabolites were indeed formed by the NB4 cells in vitro.	[]
NB4 cell growth was inhibited ( 69 - 78% at 120 h) and cell cycle progression in the G1 phase ( 82 - 85% at 120 h) was blocked by ATRA and all of the metabolites at 1 microM concentration.	[]
ATRA and its metabolites could induce NB4 cells differentiation with similar activity, as evaluated by cell morphology, by the nitroblue tetrazolium reduction test ( 82 - 88% at 120 h) or by the expression of the maturation specific cell surface marker CD11c.

Comparison of the relative potency of the retinoids using the nitroblue tetrazolium reduction test showed effective concentrations required to differentiate 50% of cells in 72 h as follows: ATRA, 15. 8 + / - 1. 7 nM; 4 - oxo - RA, 38. 3 + / - 1. 3 nM; 18 - OH - RA, 55. 5 + / - 1. 8 nM; 4 - OH - RA, 79. 8 + / - 1. 8 nM; and 5, 6 - epoxy - RA, 99. 5 + / - 1. 5 nM.	[]
The ATRA metabolites were found to exert their differentiation effects via the RAR alpha nuclear receptors, because the RAR alpha - specific antagonist BMS614 blocked metabolite - induced CD11c expression in NB4 cells.

BACKGROUND: Nasal polyposis often coexists with asthma in airway inflammatory conditions characterised by the infiltration of a range of immune cells.	[]
A potentially important role for ovarian hormones has been implicated in airway inflammation but the cellular target for such action is not known.	[]
METHODS: Expression of oestrogen receptors ( ER) and progesterone receptors ( PR) was examined using immunohistochemistry in formalin fixed nasal polyp tissues from 47 subjects.

RESULTS: Consistent with the known features of nasal polyps, CD4 + ( T helper / inducer), CD8 + ( cytotoxic / suppressor), CD68 + ( macrophages), mast cells, eosinophils and neutrophils were all clearly detected by their relevant monoclonal antibodies or appropriate histochemical staining, but only mast cells tested positive for ER / PR labelling with their polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies.

The frequencies for expression were 61. 7% for ER positive and 59. 6% for PR positive cells.	[]
The expression of ER / PR was independent of patient sex and age but was highly correlated with the numbers of mast cells ( r = 0. 973, p < 0. 001 for ER; r = 0. 955, p < 0. 001 for PR).

Numerous ER / PR positive mast cells exist in nasal polyps, indicating that this may be a major route for the involvement of sex hormones in airway inflammation when exposed to the higher and varying concentration of oestrogen and progesterone characteristic of females.	[]
NF kappa b signaling in posthypoxic endothelial cells: relevance to E - selectin expression and neutrophil adhesion.	[]
Our previous studies have implicated the nuclear transcription factor kappa B ( NF kappa B) in the regulation of adhesion molecule expression in endothelial cells exposed to anoxia - reoxygenation ( A / R) or a redox imbalance.

The objectives of this study were ( 1) to define the kinetics of NF kappa B activation by examining I kappa B alpha degradation and the nuclear translocation of p65 in response to A / R or redox imbalance ( induced by treatment of cells with diamide and buthionine sulfoximine) and ( 2) to determine whether the signal for I kappa B alpha degradation, nuclear translocation of p65, and E - selectin - mediated neutrophil adhesion is related to the activity of protein tyrosine kinase ( PTK), protein tyrosine phosphatase ( PTPase) and / or protein kinase C ( PKC).

The results demonstrate that both A / R and redox imbalance led to I kappa B alpha degradation within 30 min and the concomitant appearance of p65 in the nucleus, consistent with rapid cytosolic activation of NF kappa B and subsequent nuclear translocation of the activated p65 subunit.

Inhibition of PKC blocked I kappa B alpha degradation and p65 translocation in A / R - challenged, but not redox - altered, endothelial cells.

Similarly, A / R - induced E - selectin expression and neutrophil - endothelial cell adhesion were blocked by inhibition of PKC or PTK, while only PTK inhibited the redox - induced adhesion response.

Pretreatment of cells with N - acetyl cysteine effectively blocked A / R - or redox - induced I kappa B degradation and significantly attenuated the respective neutrophil adhesion responses.	[]
Collectively, these findings indicate that A / R - induced E - selectin expression and neutrophil - endothelial cell adhesion are mediated by both PKC and PTK, which signal rapid activation of NF kappa B.

Induction of apoptosis in human lymphocytes by the herbicide 2, 4 - dichlorophenoxyaceti acid.	[]
Dimethylammonium salt of 2, 4 - dichlorophenoxyaceti acid ( DMA - 2, 4 - D) is a widely used herbicide that is considered moderately toxic.	[]
In the present study we found that DMA - 2, 4 - D is able to cause apoptosis in peripheral blood lymphocytes of healthy individuals and Jurkat T cells.	[]
Apoptosis induced by DMA - 2, 4 - D was dose and time dependent, independent of Fas, TNF receptor 1 or the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor, and involved disruption of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and activation of caspase - 9.

While an inhibitor of caspase - 9, as well as caspase - 9 and caspase - 3 inhibitors in combination, strongly blocked DMA - 2, 4 - D - induced apoptosis, an inhibitor of caspase - 3 had a moderate inhibitory effect.

Our data indicate that DMA - 2, 4 - D kills human lymphocytes by initiating apoptosis via a direct effect on mitochondria.	[]
The activation of caspases occurs downstream of mitochondrial damage, and the dysfunction of mitochondria appears to be sufficient for triggering all downstream events leading to apoptosis.

Inhibition of IFNgamma receptor - mediated signals by IL - 6 prevents autoregulation of IFNgamma gene expression by IFNgamma during CD4 + T cell activation, thereby preventing Th1 differentiation.

Recent observations have shown two CCAAT / enhancer binding protein ( C / EBP) binding sites to be critically important for efficient human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV - 1) replication within cells of the monocyte / macrophage lineage, a cell type likely involved in transport of the virus to the brain.	[]
Additionally, sequence variation at C / EBP site I, which lies immediately upstream of the distal nuclear factor kappa B site and immediately downstream of a binding site for activating transcription factor ( ATF) / cyclic AMP response element binding protein ( CREB), has been shown to affect HIV - 1 long terminal repeat ( LTR) activity.

Given that C / EBP proteins have been shown to interact with many other transcription factors including members of the ATF / CREB family, we proceeded to determine whether an adjacent ATF / CREB binding site could affect C / EBP protein binding to C / EBP site I.

Electrophoretic mobility shift analyses indicated that selected ATF / CREB site variants assisted in the recruitment of C / EBP proteins to an adjacent, naturally occurring, low - affinity C / EBP site.

This biophysical interaction appears to occur via at least two mechanisms.	[]
First, low amounts of CREB - 1 and C / EBP appear to heterodimerize and bind to a site consisting of a half site from both the ATF / CREB and C / EBP binding sites.	"CREB - 1	22	30	Gene/Protein"	"C / EBP	35	42	Gene/Protein"	"ATF / CREB and C / EBP binding sites	127	163	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CREB - 1"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""C / EBP"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""ATF / CREB and C / EBP binding sites"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 163, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In addition, CREB - 1 homodimers bind to the ATF / CREB site and recruit C / EBP dimers to their cognate weak binding sites.

This interaction is reciprocal, since C / EBP dimer binding to a strong C / EBP site leads to enhanced CREB - 1 recruitment to ATF / CREB sites that are weakly bound by CREB.

Sequence variation at both C / EBP and ATF / CREB sites affects the molecular interactions involved in mediating both of these mechanisms.

Most importantly, sequence variation at the ATF / CREB binding site affected basal LTR activity as well as LTR function following interleukin - 6 stimulation, a treatment that leads to increases in C / EBP activation.

Selective inhibition of interleukin - 4 gene expression in human T cells by aspirin.	[]
Previous studies indicated that aspirin ( acetylsalicylic acid [ ASA]) can have profound immunomodulatory effects by regulating cytokine gene expression in several types of cells.	[]
This study is the first in which concentrations of ASA in the therapeutic range were found to significantly reduce interleukin ( IL) - 4 secretion and RNA expression in freshly isolated and mitogen - primed human CD4 + T cells.	[]
In contrast, ASA did not affect IL - 13, interferon - gamma, and IL - 2 expression.

The structurally unrelated nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs indomethacin and flurbiprofen did not affect cytokine gene expression in T cells, whereas the weak cyclo - oxygenase inhibitor salicylic acid was at least as effective as ASA in inhibiting IL - 4 expression and promoter activity.

The inhibitory effect of ASA on IL - 4 transcription was not mediated by decreased nuclear expression of the known salicylate target nuclear factor ( NF) - kappaB and was accompanied by reduced binding of an inducible factor to an IL - 4 promoter region upstream of, but not overlapping, the NF of activated T cells - and NF - kappaB - binding P1 element.

In contrast, B cell - deficient ( muMT / muMT) mice developed arthritis at an incidence and severity similar to that of controls.	[]
RelB - deficient ( RelB - / -) bone marrow chimeric mice had arthritis that was significantly reduced in incidence and severity.	[]
In B6 mice, flow cytometry demonstrated an IL - 1 - dependent leukocyte infiltration into the synovial compartment and RNase protection assays revealed induction of messenger RNA ( mRNA) for the chemokines monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, macrophage inhibitory protein 2 ( MIP - 2), RANTES, MIP - 1alpha, and MIP - 1beta, in vivo and in vitro.

Acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL) is always associated with chromosomal translocations that disrupt the retinoic acid receptor alpha ( RARalpha) gene.	[]
Whether these translocations relate to a role for endogenous RARalpha in normal granulopoiesis remains uncertain because most studies addressing this question have used non - physiological overexpression systems.	"endogenous RARalpha	50	69	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""endogenous RARalpha"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Granulocyte differentiation in cells derived from RARalpha - deficient ( RARalpha ( - / -)) mice was studied and evaluated in the context of agonist - bound and ligand - free RARalpha.

Our results demonstrate that RARalpha is dispensable for granulopoiesis, as RARalpha ( - / -) mice have a normal granulocyte population despite an impaired ability to respond to retinoids.	"RARalpha	29	37	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RARalpha"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
However, although it is not absolutely required, RARalpha can bidirectionally modulate granulopoiesis.	"RARalpha	49	57	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RARalpha"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
RARalpha stimulates differentiation in response to exogenous retinoic acid.	"RARalpha	0	8	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RARalpha"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Furthermore, endogenous retinoids control granulopoiesis in vivo, as either vitamin A - deficient mice or animals treated with an RAR antagonist accumulate more immature granulocytes in their bone marrow.	[]
Conversely, RARalpha acts to limit differentiation in the absence of ligand because granulocyte precursors from RARalpha ( - / -) mice differentiate earlier in culture.

Constitutive PI3 - K activity is essential for proliferation, but not survival, of Theileria parva - transformed B cells.	[]

One example is an E - box of the E47 / E12 type ( 5 ' - CAGCTG - 3 '), which is found in all promoters of the human and murine Ig - kappa gene subgroups / families, with the exception of subgroups II and VI and their related murine families.

We now demonstrate that a 16 amino acid peptide from antennapedia can facilitate the cytoplasmic uptake of CTL epitope 9 - mer peptides.	[]
Synthetic peptides were made containing the 16 - mer antennapedia peptide linked in tandem to the ovalbumin SIINFEKL CTL peptide.	[]
The peptide complex was shown to rapidly internalise into APCs by confocal microscopy.	[]
This peptide induced CTL in C57BL / 6 mice and protected them against growth of an ovalbumin expressing tumour cell line ( E. G7 - OVA).	[]
The ability of the hybrid peptide to be processed and presented by APCs was similar, whether the SIINFEKL sequence was appended at the C - terminus or N - terminus of the Antennapedia peptide.

Bone marrow cells promote TH2 polarization and inhibit virus - specific CTL generation.	[]
This laboratory recently reported that human bone marrow cells ( BMC) inhibit the generation of virus - specific CTL in culture.	[]
The culture supernatants contained increased levels of prostaglandin E ( 2) ( PGE ( 2)) ( shown to favor TH2 cell development) and also inhibited EBV - CTL effector cell development.	[]

EBV - specific CTL were then generated in vitro by stimulating PBL with autologous EBV - transformed B cells ( EBV - B) in the presence or absence of autologous BMC.	[]
The addition of BMC to the EBV - CTL generation cultures increased the intracellular expression in CD3 + cells of IL - 4, - 5, - 6, - 10, and - 13.	[]

Mechanisms and clinical relevance of nongenomic glucocorticoid actions.	[]
Glucocorticoids have profound anti - inflammatory and immunosuppressive actions when used therapeutically.	[]
The therapeutic dose is quite variable and depends on the disease, but ranges from very low to extremely high.	[]
The rationale for the use of various dosage regimens for specific clinical indications is the existence of three distinct, therapeutically relevant effects: genomic, specific nongenomic and unspecific nongenomic.	[]
Genomic effects are mediated by cytosolic receptors that alter expression of specific genes.	"cytosolic receptors	32	51	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cytosolic receptors"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Specific nongenomic effects occur within a few minutes and are mediated by steroid - selective membrane receptors.	"steroid - selective membrane receptors	75	113	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""steroid - selective membrane receptors"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Unspecific nongenomic effects occur within seconds, but only at high glucocorticoid dosages, and seem to result from direct interactions with biological membranes.	[]
For unspecific nongenomic effects, methylprednisolone and other glucocorticoids have been shown to inhibit cation cycling across the plasma membrane, but to have little effect on protein synthesis.	[]
Thus, glucocorticoids could diminish or prevent the acute immune response by interfering with processes such as the rise in intracellular Ca2 + concentration.	[]
It is proposed that the additional therapeutic benefit of higher doses is obtained via these nongenomic effects.	[]
High glucose - induced intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 ( ICAM - 1) expression through an osmotic effect in rat mesangial cells is PKC - NF - kappa B - dependent.

AIMS / HYPOTHESIS: Infiltration of mononuclear cells and glomerular enlargement accompanied by glomerular cell proliferation are very early characteristics of the pathophysiology of diabetes.	[]
To clarify the mechanism of early diabetic nephropathy, we measured [ 3H] - thymidine incorporation and cell numbers to show the influence of a high ambient glucose concentration and the osmotic effect on rat mesangial cell proliferation.	[]
We also measured the effect of high glucose on the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 and vascular adhesion molecule - 1 by flow cytometry and semiquantitative RT - PCR in mesangial cells and the adhesion of leukocytes to mesangial cells.

METHODS / RESULTS: Cells exposed to high D - glucose ( 30 mmol / l) caused an increase in [ 3H] - thymidine incorporation and cell numbers at 24 and 48 h and normalized at 72 h ( p < 0. 05), whereas these changes were not found in high mannitol ( 30 mmol / l), IL - 1 beta, or TNF alpha - stimulated mesangial cells.

Cells exposed to high - glucose ( 15, 30, or 60 mmol / l) or osmotic agents ( L - glucose, raffinose and mannitol) showed that intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 expression began to increase after 24 h, reached its maximum at 24 and 48 h and gradually decreased afterwards.

The stimulatory effects of high glucose and high mannitol on mRNA expression were observed as early as 6 h and reached its maximum at 12 h.	[]
Up - regulation of ICAM - 1 protein and mRNA was also found in IL - 1 - beta and TNF - alpha - stimulated mesangial cells.

Neither vascular adhesion molecule - 1 protein nor mRNA expression was, however, affected by high glucose and high mannitol.	"vascular adhesion molecule - 1	8	38	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""vascular adhesion molecule - 1"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Notably, the protein kinase C inhibitors calphostin C and staurosporine reduced high glucose - or high mannitol - induced intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 mRNA expression and high glucose - induced proliferation.

Furthermore, the NF - kappa B inhibitor N - tosyl - L - phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone reduced high glucose - or high mannitol - induced intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 mRNA expression and high glucose - induced proliferation.

Results showed that high glucose ( 15, 30 mmol / l) or high concentrations of osmotic agents remarkably increased the number of adherent leukocytes to mesangial cells ( p < 0. 01) compared with control cells ( 5 mmol / l D - glucose).	[]
Functional blocking of intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 on mesangial cells with rat intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 monoclonal antibody, calphostin C, staurosporine, or N - tosyl - L - phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone significantly inhibited high glucose - or high mannitol - induced increase in leukocyte adhesion ( p < < 0. 05).

CONCLUSION / INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that high glucose can upregulate intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 protein and mRNA expression but not vascular adhesion molecule - 1 expression in mesangial cells and promote leukocyte adhesion through up - regulation of intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 through osmotic effect, possibly depending on the protein kinase C nuclear factor - kappa B ( PKC - NF - kappa B) pathway.

High glucose itself can also promote mesangial cell proliferation through the PKC - NF - kappa B pathways.	[]
We conclude that hyperglycaemia in itself seems to be an important factor in the development of early diabetic nephropathy.	[]

Human renal mesangial cells are a target for the anti - inflammatory action of 9 - cis retinoic acid.	[]
Mesangial cells play an active role in the inflammatory response to glomerular injury.	[]

9 - cRA inhibited foetal calf serum - induced CHMC proliferation.	[]
It also prevented CHMC death induced by the inflammatory mediator H ( 2) O ( 2).	[]
This preventive effect was not due to any increase in H ( 2) O ( 2) catabolism and it persisted even when both catalase and glutathione synthesis were inhibited.	[]
Finally, 9 - cRA diminished monocyte adhesion to FCS - stimulated CHMC.	[]
Interestingly, the retinoid also inhibited in FCS - stimulated cells the protein expression of two mesangial adhesion molecules, fibronectin and osteopontin, but it did not modify the protein expression of intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 and vascular adhesion molecule - 1.

9 - cRA was toxic only at 50 microM ( a concentration 50 - 5000 times higher than required for the effects above).	[]
Cell death occurred by apoptosis, whose onset was associated with a pronounced increase in catalase activity and reduced glutathione content, being more effectively induced by all - trans retinoic acid.	[]
Modulation of the oxidant / antioxidant balance failed to inhibit apoptosis.	[]
We conclude that mesangial cells might be a target for the treatment of inflammatory glomerulopathies with 9 - cRA.	[]

Our findings dismiss the concept that the different immunoglobulin expression in cHD and LPHD is due to disrupting mutations of immunoglobulin V genes in cHD but is most likely due to a down - regulation of Oct2 and / or BOB. 1 / OBF. 1.

Recently, members of the NF - kappaB family, including p65 ( Rel A), have been implicated in promoting survival of various hematopoeitic neoplasms, including T cell malignancies such as adult T cell leukemia - lymphoma.

We investigated the expression of active NF - kappa B p65 ( Rel A) in cases of mycosis fungoides ( MF) and the effect of chemical inhibitors of NF - kappa B on apoptosis in cutaneous T cell lymphoma ( CTCL) cell lines.

Paraffin - embedded tissues from 23 cutaneous lesions and a single lymph node biopsy from patients diagnosed with MF were evaluated for p65 ( Rel A) expression by using a monoclonal mouse antibody that detects the activated form of p65 ( Rel A).

Apoptosis after treatment with the NF - kappa B inhibitors gliotoxin, MG132, BAY 11 - 7082, and BAY 11 - 7085 was quantitatively measured in the CTCL cell lines HuT - 78 and HH by propidium iodide ( PI) / cell cycle analysis for detection of a hypodiploid ( sub - G ( 0)) population and by determination of increased Annexin V / 7 - amino - actinomycin D ( 7 - AAD) expression.	[]
Nuclear extracts from CTCL cells before and after chemical inhibition were analyzed for NF - kappa B nuclear DNA - binding activity by electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA) with quantitative densitometry.	[]
Nuclear expression of p65 ( Rel A) before and after treatment with the various inhibitory compounds was measured by immunofluorescence staining in each CTCL cell line.	[]
Neoplastic T lymphocytes from 22 of 24 cases of MF showed strong nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of active p65 ( Rel A).	[]
Compared with untreated control cells, a marked increase in apoptosis, a significant decrease in NF - kappa B DNA - binding activity, and a marked decrease in nuclear p65 ( Rel A) expression were seen in cells from both CTCL cell lines after chemical NF - kappa B inhibition.	[]
These data show that the active form of NF - kappa B p65 ( Rel A) is commonly expressed in neoplastic T lymphocytes in patients with MF.	[]
In CTCL cell lines, the significant decrease in nuclear NF - kappa B expression and the marked increase in spontaneous apoptosis caused by chemical NF - kappa B inhibition suggest a critical role for NF - kappa B in the pathogenesis and tumor cell maintenance of CTCLs.

Tax703 preferentially activated the kappaB element but not the CRE - like one, whereas TaxM22 showed the reverse.

In addition, Tax703 and Tax, but not TaxM22, converted cell growth of a mouse T - cell line from being interleukin ( IL) - 2 - dependent to being IL - 2 - independent.

Unlike the wild - type Tax, Tax703 and TaxM22 only weakly activated the AP - 1 site in the T - cell line.

Thus, Tax seems to activate the AP - 1 site via mechanisms distinct from those of kappaB or CRE - like elements, and the activation of the AP - 1 site is dispensable for IL - 2 - independent growth of CTLL - 2.

Strict control of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication by a genetic switch: Tet for Tat.	[]
Live - attenuated human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV - 1) variants have shown great promise as AIDS vaccines, but continued replication can lead to the selection of faster - replicating variants that are pathogenic.	[]
We therefore designed HIV - 1 genomes that replicate exclusively upon addition of the nontoxic effector doxycycline ( dox).	"HIV - 1 genomes	22	37	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""HIV - 1 genomes"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
This was achieved by replacement of the viral TAR - Tat system for transcriptional activation by the Escherichia coli - derived Tet system for inducible gene expression.	[]
These designer ` ` HIV - rtTA ' ' viruses replicate in a strictly dox - dependent manner both in a T - cell line and in primary blood cells, and the rate of replication can be fine - tuned by simple variation of the dox concentration.	[]
These HIV - rtTA viruses provide a tool to perform genetics, e. g., selection and optimization experiments, with the E. coli - derived Tet reagents in a eukaryotic background.	[]
Furthermore, such viruses may represent improved vaccine candidates because their replication can be turned on and off at will.	[]

A property of SF that is independent of TNF - alpha and other cytokines is responsible for the induction of a novel slowly migrating NF - kappaB - binding complex.

15 - Deoxy - Delta ( 12, 14) - PGJ ( 2) ( 15d - PGJ ( 2)), a PPAR - gamma agonist, has a dose - dependent antiproliferative and cytotoxic effect on normal and malignant B cells as shown by [ ( 3) H] thymidine and 3 - [ 4, 5 - dimethylthiazol - 2 - yl] - 2, 5 - diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays.	[]
Only PPAR - gamma agonists ( thiazolidinediones), and not PPAR - alpha agonists, mimicked the effect of 15d - PGJ ( 2) on B - lineage cells, indicating that the mechanism by which 15d - PGJ ( 2) negatively affects B - lineage cells involves in part PPAR - gamma.	"PPAR - gamma	5	17	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PPAR - gamma"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
The mechanism by which PPAR - gamma agonists induce cytotoxicity is via apoptosis, as shown by annexin V staining and as confirmed by DNA fragmentation detected using the TUNEL assay.	[]
Interestingly, addition of PGF ( 2alpha), which was not known to affect lymphocytes, dramatically attenuated the deleterious effects of PPAR - gamma agonists on B lymphomas.	[]
Surprisingly, 15d - PGJ ( 2) induced a massive increase in nuclear mitogen - activated protein kinase activation, and pretreatment with PGF ( 2alpha) blunted the mitogen - activated protein kinase activation.	[]
This is the first study evaluating PPAR - gamma expression and its significance on B lymphocytes.	[]
PPAR - gamma agonists may serve as a counterbalance to the stimulating effects of other PGs, namely PGE ( 2), which promotes B cell differentiation.	[]
Finally, the use of PGs, such as 15d - PGJ ( 2), and synthetic PPAR - gamma agonists to induce apoptosis in B - lineage cells may lead to the development of novel therapies for fatal B lymphomas	[]
Inhibition of STAT3 signaling leads to apoptosis of leukemic large granular lymphocytes and decreased Mcl - 1 expression.	[]
Large granular lymphocyte ( LGL) leukemia is characterized by the expansion of antigen - activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes.	[]
These leukemic cells are resistant to Fas - mediated apoptosis despite expressing high levels of Fas.	"Fas	38	41	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Fas"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
We found that leukemic LGL from 19 patients displayed high levels of activated STAT3.	"activated STAT3	69	84	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""activated STAT3"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Treatment of leukemic LGL with the JAK - selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG - 490 induced apoptosis with a corresponding decrease in STAT - DNA binding activity.	"STAT	137	141	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""STAT"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Moreover, using an antisense oligonucleotide approach to diminish STAT3 expression, we found that Fas sensitivity was restored in leukemic LGL.	[]
AG - 490 - induced apoptosis in leukemic LGL was independent of Bcl - xL or Bcl - 2 expression.	[]
However, we found that the Bcl - 2 - family protein Mcl - 1 was significantly reduced by AG - 490 treatment.	"Bcl - 2 - family protein Mcl - 1	27	59	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Bcl - 2 - family protein Mcl - 1"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

Transcription factor activating transcription factor ( ATF) - 2 is activated by inflammatory signals transduced by the JNK and p38 MAP kinase pathways.	[]
To better define the role of ATF - 2 in inflammation, adult mice expressing small amounts of a mutant ATF - 2 protein were challenged with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS), anti - CD3 antibody or virus.

However, similar to what was observed after p38 kinase inhibition in normal mice, relative ATF - 2 deficiency did not prevent the development of a mononuclear cell infiltrate in the week following an inflammatory stimulus.	[]
ATF - 2 mutant mice proved more susceptible to death than control mice from LPS plus D - galactosamine injection or Coxsackievirus B3 infection and had a higher incidence of mononuclear pulmonary infiltrates after exposure to Herpes simplex virus - 1.	[]
ATF - 2 is essential for maximal immediate induction of adhesion molecules and cytokine genes, but at later time points may even protect against overactive immune responses.

RESULTS: Both peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid eosinophils expressed NFATp and NFATc protein.	"NFATp and NFATc protein	86	109	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NFATp and NFATc protein"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Unlike activated T cells, which express multiple NFATc isoforms, eosinophils preferentially express the approximately 85 - kd isoform.	[]
In addition, eosinophils were found to constitutively express NFATc mRNA.	"NFATc mRNA	62	72	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NFATc mRNA"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
A brief incubation with the T ( H) 2 cytokines IL - 4 and IL - 5 was sufficient to induce the nuclear translocation of NFATc.

Analysis of equilibrium binding of ( 125) I - labeled BLyS to purified human tonsillar B cells demonstrated saturable binding.	[]
Scatchard analysis of the binding data revealed a single class of high - affinity binding on human B cells with approximately 2600 binding sites per cell and an apparent dissociation constant ( K ( D)) of about 0. 1 nM.	[]
In addition we report that BLyS binding to B cells results in the activation of NF - kappaB and the Ets family transcription factor, ELF - 1, and in the induction of mRNA for Polo - like kinase ( PLK).

The Nef protein of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV - 1) has been shown to enhance the infectivity of virus particles, downmodulate cell surface proteins, and associate with many intracellular proteins that are thought to facilitate HIV infection.

One of the challenges in defining the molecular events regulated by Nef has been obtaining good expression of Nef protein in T cells.	"Nef	68	71	Gene/Protein"	"Nef protein	110	121	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Nef"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""Nef protein"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
This has been attributed to effects of Nef on cell proliferation and apoptosis.	"Nef	39	42	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Nef"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
We have designed a Nef protein that is readily expressed in T - cell lines and whose function is inducibly activated.	"Nef protein	19	30	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Nef protein"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
It is composed of a fusion between full - length Nef and the estrogen receptor hormone - binding domain ( Nef - ER).

The Nef - ER is kept in an inactive state due to steric hindrance, and addition of the membrane - permeable drug 4 - hydroxytamoxifen ( 4 - HT), which binds to the ER domain, leads to inducible activation of Nef - ER within cells.	"Nef - ER	4	12	Gene/Protein"	"ER domain	164	173	Gene/Protein"	"Nef - ER	4	12	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Nef - ER"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""ER domain"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""Nef - ER"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
We demonstrate that Nef - ER inducibly associates with the 62 - kDa Ser / Thr kinase and is localized to specific membrane microdomains ( lipid rafts) only after activation.

Using this inducible Nef, we also compared the specific requirements for CD4 and HLA - A2 downmodulation in a SupT1 T - cell line.	"Nef	21	24	Gene/Protein"	"CD4	73	76	Gene/Protein"	"HLA - A2	81	89	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Nef"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""HLA - A2"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Half - maximal downmodulation of cell surface CD4 required very little active Nef - ER and occurred as early as 4 h after addition of 4 - HT.	"cell surface CD4	33	49	Gene/Protein"	"Nef - ER	78	86	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""cell surface CD4"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""Nef - ER"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
In contrast, 50% downmodulation of HLA - A2 by Nef required 16 to 24 h and about 50 - to 100 - fold - greater concentrations of 4 - HT.	"HLA - A2	35	43	Gene/Protein"	"Nef	47	50	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""HLA - A2"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""Nef"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
These data suggest that HLA - A2 downmodulation may require certain threshold levels of active Nef.

Regulation of chemokine mRNA expression in a rat model of vanadium - induced pulmonary inflammation.	[]
Environmental and occupational exposure to vanadium dusts results in toxic effects mainly confined to the respiratory system.	[]
Using a rat model of acute lung inflammation induced by intratracheal instillation of sodium metavanadate ( NaVO3) at the dose of 200 microg V / kg, we investigated the relationship between the cytologic characterization of pulmonary inflammation and the expression of chemokine mRNA.	"chemokine mRNA	269	283	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""chemokine mRNA"", ""start_span"": 269, ""end_span"": 283, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Significant polymorphonuclear leukocyte ( PMN) influx ( P < 0. 01) into the lung was noted 4 h after NaVO3 instillation, whereas alveolar macrophages ( AMs) in bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL) cells appeared to decrease significantly.	[]
In contrast, neither PMNs nor AMs changed substantially 1 h after NaVO3 instillation.	[]
By Northern analysis, macrophage inflammatory protein ( MIP) - 2 mRNA in BAL cells increased markedly 1 h after NaVO3 instillation and reduced a little bit at 4 h, whereas MIP - 1alpha mRNA in BAL cells was expressed relatively high 1 h after NaVO3 instillation, although a basal expression was detected in control group, and returned rapidly nearly to control level at 4 h.

Since MIP - 2 is a potent PMN chemoattractant and MIP - 1alpha is a potent macrophage / monocyte chemoattractant has been well known.

The facts that PMN influx was preceded by increased MIP - 2 mRNA expression, suggesting that MIP - 2 is involved in the development of NaVO3 - induced pulmonary inflammation, whereas increased MIP - 1alpha mRNA expression was followed by decreased AMs in BAL cells, suggesting AMs might be activated by MIP - 1alpha, adherent to the lining surface of the airways and then resistant to be washed out.

To delineate the mechanisms of transcriptional activation, we recently cloned the 5 ' - flanking region of the MIP - 2 gene.

Using electrophoretic mobility shift assay, increased nuclear NF - kappaB, not AP - 1, binding activity was detected 1 h after NaVO3 instillation, which correlated with the induction of MIP - 2 mRNA.

Activation of signal transduction and apoptosis in healthy lymphomonocytes exposed to bystander HIV - 1 - infected cells.	[]
Persistent activation of the immune system is one of the hallmarks of HIV - 1 infection.	[]
In this study we analysed the induction of factors involved in cytokine signal transduction, such as STAT 1 proteins and IRF - 1 mRNA, in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC) exposed to HIV - infected cells, and the induction of apoptosis.

Western blot analyses and reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction results indicate that both cells infected with a X4 strain and cells infected with a R5 strain are able to increase intracellular levels of STAT 1alpha and beta proteins as well as IRF - 1 mRNA.

Bone resorption is regulated by the immune system, where T - cell expression of RANKL ( receptor activator of nuclear factor ( NF) - kappaB ligand), a member of the tumour - necrosis factor family that is essential for osteoclastogenesis, may contribute to pathological conditions, such as autoimmune arthritis.

However, it does induce chemotaxis, trans - Matrigel migration, and secretion of matrix metalloproteinase 9 ( MMP - 9) and vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) by these cells, and both SDF - 1 and TPO increase the adhesion of alpha ( IIb) beta ( 3) ( +) cells to fibrinogen and vitronectin.

Investigating the intracellular signaling pathways induced by SDF - 1 and TPO revealed some overlapping patterns of protein phosphorylation / activation ( mitogen - activated protein kinase [ MAPK] p42 / 44, MAPK p38, and AKT [ protein kinase B]) and some that were distinct for TPO ( eg, JAK - STAT) and for SDF - 1 ( eg, NF - kappa B).

It was also found that though inhibition of phosphatidyl - inositol 3 - kinase ( PI - 3K) by LY294002 in alpha ( IIb) beta ( 3) ( +) cells induced apoptosis and inhibited chemotaxis adhesion and the secretion of MMP - 9 and VEGF, the inhibition of MAPK p42 / 44 ( by the MEK inhibitor U0126) had no effect on the survival, proliferation, and migration of these cells.

Hence, it is suggested that the proliferative effect of TPO is more related to activation of the JAK - STAT pathway ( unique to TPO), and the PI - 3K - AKT axis is differentially involved in TPO - and SDF - 1 - dependent signaling.

Accordingly, PI - 3K is involved in TPO - mediated inhibition of apoptosis, TPO - and SDF - 1 - regulated adhesion to fibrinogen and vitronectin, and SDF - 1 - mediated migration.

Among them, thymic epithelial cells ( TEC) are known to exert dominant roles in their survival and functional shaping.	[]

We have previously investigated this issue in a co - culture system composed of TEC cultures derived from human normal thymus and heterologous thymocytes.	[]

The hsp70 co - chaperone Hip has been recovered in receptor. hsp90 heterocomplexes at an intermediate stage of assembly in reticulocyte lysate, and Hip is also thought to be an intrinsic component of the assembly machinery.

Cutting edge: STAT6 - deficient mice have enhanced tumor immunity to primary and metastatic mammary carcinoma.	[]

Tumor immunologists have hypothesized that Th1 cells are critical in tumor immunity because they facilitate differentiation of CD8 ( +) T cells, which are potent anti - tumor effectors.	[]
We have used STAT4 ( - / -) and STAT6 ( - / -) mice to test this hypothesis.	[]
BALB / c and knockout mice were challenged in the mammary gland with the highly malignant and spontaneously metastatic BALB / c - derived 4T1 mammary carcinoma.	[]
Primary tumor growth and metastatic disease are reduced in STAT6 ( - / -) mice relative to BALB / c and STAT4 ( - / -) mice.	[]
Ab depletions demonstrate that the effect is mediated by CD8 ( +) T cells, and immunized STAT6 ( - / -) mice have higher levels of 4T1 - specific CTL than BALB / c or STAT4 ( - / -) mice.	[]
Surprisingly, Th1 or Th2 cells are not involved, because CD4 depletion does not diminish the anti - tumor effect.	[]
Therefore, deletion of the STAT6 gene facilitates development of potent anti - tumor immunity via a CD4 ( +) - independent pathway.	"STAT6 gene	27	37	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""STAT6 gene"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"

Based on time - course studies, proteasome activity is primarily required after initial endocytosis of the IL - 2. IL - 2R.	"proteasome	32	42	Gene/Protein"	"[{""token"": ""proteasome"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"
Proteasome function was also necessary for the lysosomal degradation of IL - 2 internalized by IL - 2R that were comprised of cytoplasmic tailless beta - or gamma c - subunits, suggesting that the target protein for the proteasome is independent of either the cytoplasmic tail of the IL - 2R beta - or gamma c - subunits and their associated signaling components.

Therefore, a functional proteasome is required for optimal endocytosis of the IL - 2R / ligand complex and is essential for the subsequent lysosomal degradation of IL - 2, possibly by regulating trafficking to the lysosome.

We investigated lineage - specific expression of both isomers in human erythroid and megakaryocytic cells by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or Northern blot analysis.	[]

RESULTS: When CD34 ( +) cells isolated from human cord blood were induced to unilineage erythroid or megakaryocytic differentiation in liquid suspension culture, both transcripts, although barely detected at day 0, were induced in both erythroid and megakaryocytic cultures.	[]

Although both isomers were expressed in human erythroid - megakaryocytic cell lines, megakaryocytic maturation with loss of erythroid phenotype induced by phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA) resulted in exclusive downregulation of fNF - E2, suggesting that fNF - E2 promoter is more erythroid specific.

We have established optimal conditions for the measurement of glucocorticoid receptors ( GR) in human white cells using a whole - cell binding assay with [ 3H] dexamethasone as the ligand, and the subsequent determination of the GR content in normal human lymphocytes and in leukemic cells of patients with various forms of acute and chronic leukemia.

Duplicate samples of these cell suspensions were incubated with increasing concentrations of H3Dexamethasone ( 1 x 10 ( - 10) M - 1 x 10 ( - 9) M) for 30 minutes at 37 degrees C.	[]
Analysis of the proportion of steroid bound to whole cells showed evidence for specific, rapidly saturable, receptors in the cells obtained from synovial tissue, but this was not found in synovial fluid cells.	[]
Electron micrographs showed that cells obtained from synovial tissue consisted of synovial fibroblast - and macrophage - types, lymphocytes, monocytes and macrophages.	[]
Polymorphonuclear leucocytes appeared to be absent.	[]
However, in synovial fluid cell type polymorphonuclear leucocytes were the predominant cell type.	[]

As with the prototypical NF - kappa B p50 - p65 heterodimer, this novel p65 homodimeric form of NF - kappa B is functionally sequestered in the cytoplasm but rapidly appears in the nuclear compartment following cellular stimulation.

Site - directed mutagenesis studies indicate that the homodimerization function of p65 is dependent upon the presence of cysteine 216 and a conserved recognition motif for protein kinase A ( RRPS; amino acids 273 to 276), both of which reside within a 91 - amino - acid segment of the Rel homology domain that mediates self - association.

In contrast, mutations at these two sites do not affect heterodimerization of p65 with p50 or its functional interaction with I kappa B alpha.

Taken together with prior in vivo transcription studies, these results suggest that the biological activities of p65 and p50 homodimers are independently regulated, thereby providing an integrated and flexible control mechanism for the rapid activation and repression of NF - kappa B / Rel - directed gene expression.

Carrier determination for X - linked agammaglobulinemia using X inactivation analysis of purified B cells.	[]
We report the development of a relatively quick and simple method for the assessment of X inactivation status for carrier determination in families affected by X - linked agammaglobulinemia ( XLA).	[]
This method utilises an immunomagnetic separation technique for B cell purification and a polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) based assay for the determination of methylation status at the androgen receptor ( AR) gene locus to assess whether X inactivation is random or non - random at this locus.	[]
We report the results we have obtained using this assay to investigate females known to be carriers of various X - linked immunodeficiency disorders.	[]

Commitment of HL - 60 cells to macrophage or granulocytic differentiation was achieved by incubation with 4 beta - phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA) for 30 - 60 min or with dimethyl sulphoxide ( DMSO) for 24 h respectively.	[]
The commitment stage towards PMA - induced macrophage differentiation was associated with increases in jun B and c - fos mRNA levels, as well as with an increase in the binding activity of transcription factor AP - 1.

Although samples at all the stages contained significant numbers of the granulocytes ( i. e. greater than 7 / high - power field), the 100% values for late - proliferative and adaptation hyperplasia were significantly higher than the values for the resting ( 81. 8%), early ( 82. 4%) and mid - ( 87. 9%) proliferative and secretory ( 83. 3%) phases.

By using a reporter - based expression approach, a T - cell - specific enhancer was identified by its close association with a prominent T - cell - restricted hypersensitive sites in the last intron of the CD8 alpha gene.

Deletion studies demonstrated that the minimal enhancer is adjacent to a negative regulatory element.	[]
DNA sequence analysis of the minimal enhancer revealed a striking cluster of consensus binding sites for Ets - 1, TCF - 1, CRE, GATA - 3, LyF - 1, and bHLH proteins which were verified by electrophoretic mobility shift assays.

The functional importance of the other binding sites only became apparent when combinations of mutations were analyzed.	[]
Taken together, these results suggest that the human CD8 alpha gene is regulated by the interaction of multiple T - cell nuclear proteins with a transcriptional enhancer located in the last intron of the gene.

We conclude that expression of the human IL - 3 gene requires the AP - 1 and Elf - 1 binding sites; however, unlike other previously characterized cytokine genes such as IL - 2, the AP - 1 and Elf - 1 factors can bind independently in the IL - 3 gene.

The mechanisms contributing to persistent T cell activation and poor response to glucocorticoids in chronic inflammatory illnesses such as steroid resistant ( SR) asthma are poorly defined.	[]
We examined the possibility that certain cytokines, specifically IL - 2 and IL - 4, could affect T cell response to glucocorticoids.

A [ 3H] dexamethasone radioligand - binding assay was used to measure the number of glucocorticoid receptors ( GR) and dissociation constant ( Kd) in PBMC from normal donors and patients with SR asthma, cultured in the absence and presence of these cytokines.

PBMC from normal donors incubated for 48 h in the presence of combination IL - 2 + IL - 4 had nuclear GR with significantly reduced binding affinity ( GR Kd = 36. 1 + / - 1. 63 nM, mean + / - SEM; p = 0. 0001) as compared with PBMC incubated with medium alone ( GR Kd = 6. 74 + / - 0. 46 nM).

The cytosolic GR Kd remained unchanged.	[]
However, when PBMC were incubated with IL - 2 alone or IL - 4 alone, no change in GR - binding affinity was observed.

Furthermore, when T cells and non - T cells were individually stimulated with combination IL - 2 + IL - 4, a significant reduction in GR - binding affinity was observed only in the T cell population ( p = 0. 0001).	[]
The IL - 2 + IL - 4 - induced alteration in PBMC GR Kd was associated with an increase in GR number ( 8348 + / - 964 vs 1710 + / - 228 sites / cell; p = 0. 0003).	[]
More importantly, the alteration in PBMC GR - binding affinity with IL - 2 + IL - 4 was associated with a functional change in T cell response to methylprednisolone MPN, i. e., a reduced inhibitory effect of MPN on PMA / ionomycin - induced T cell proliferation.

These effects of IL - 2 + IL - 4 on PBMC GR affinity and response to MPN were blocked by co - incubation with IFN - gamma.

The altered PBMC GR binding from patients with SR asthma reversed to normal when incubated with medium alone, but was sustained with IL - 2 + IL - 4.

Glucocorticoid receptor activation and inactivation in c ultured human lymphocytes.	[]
Although glucocorticoids are not cytolytic for and do not inhibit the growth of the IM - 9 line of cultured human lymphoblasts, these cells have a high steroid - binding capacity.	[]
We have used IM - 9 cells in order to examine whether unoccupied glucocorticoid receptors are inactivated and activated in intact cells.

when IM - 9 cells are incubated in glucose - free medium in a nitrogen atmosphere, both their ability to bind triamcinolone acetonide and their ATP levels decline and, when glucose and oxygen are reintroduced, ATP levels and receptor activity return.	[]
The specific glucocorticoid - binding activity of cytosol prepared from cells exposed to various degrees of energy limitation is directly correlated with the ATP content.	[]
Receptor activation in intact cells is rapid and independent of protein synthesis.	[]
Cytosol prepared from inactivated cells can not be activated by addition of ATP.	[]
The inactivation of glucocorticoid receptors that occurs when cytosol from normal IM - 9 cells is incubated at 25 degrees C is inhibited by molybdate, vanadate, fluoride, ATP, and several other nucleotides.

Some liberated dimers were retained in the cytoplasm, however, through binding to newly synthesized I kappa B alpha, a finding which strongly suggests ( i) that the LPS - induced signal causes dissociation of complexes rather than preventing their association and ( ii) that dissociation results from modification of I kappa B alpha and not of c - rel or p65.

Because H2O2 is a potent ROI generator that readily crosses the plasma membrane, we used H2O2 to examine the effects of ROI on signal transduction.	[]
We now provide evidence that the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A and the free radical scavenger N - acetyl - cysteine inhibit both radiation - induced and H2O2 - induced activation of NF - kappa B, indicating that activation triggered by ROI is dependent on tyrosine kinase activity.

After unilateral immunization of adrenalectomized male rats, a 50% increase in glucocorticoid receptor sites per cell, determined by binding of dexamethasone, was observed in cell suspensions of homolateral lymph nodes over those from the contralateral nonimmunized side of the same animal.	[]
The association constant for dexamethasone was similar in both groups, as was the stereospecificity for various steroids, the time course of cytoplasmic and nuclear association, and cytoplasmic - to - nuclear translocation.	[]
Despite a 50% increase in the number of glucocorticoid receptor sites per cell, the cells from the homolateral and controlateral lymph nodes were equally sensitive to the inhibitory effects of dexamethasone, as determined by measurements of the incorporation of radiolabeled precursors of protein, RNA, and DNA, or measurements of in vitro cell survival.

ATP - depletion experiments suggest the existence of a nonbinding form of the receptor; ` ` chase ' ' experiments suggest reaction of hormone directly with nuclear - bound receptor; experiments on depletion and replenishment of cytoplasmic receptor using cortisol and dexamethasone suggest the existence of at least two subpopulations of nuclear - bound hormone - receptor complex.

We have found that mitogen or immunologic stimulation of human peripheral lymphocytes in culture leads within 24 h or so to a striking increase in the number of glucocorticoid receptor sites per cell.

Contrary to the widely held view that mitogen - stimulated cells become insensitive to glucocorticoids, our experiments show that with respect to inhibition of thymidine and uridine incorporation and glucose uptake, the cells are highly sensitive to dexamethasone at 24, 48, and 72 h after stimulation with concanavalin A.

A reliable procedure is described for isolating 3H - triamcinolone acetonide ( 3H - TA) receptor complexes from purified chronic lymphatic leukemia ( CLL) lymphocyte nuclei, based on the use of carbobenzoxy - L - phenylalanine ( CBZ - L - phe) to prevent breakdown of hormone - receptor complexes during extraction of nuclei with 0. 6M KCl.

RESULTS.	[]
Higher affinity EBS were found mostly in nuclear cell fractions of either RA or control synovial tissues ( 28 of the 33).	[]
These EBS were present to a lesser extent in soluble cell fractions ( 11 of the 33).	[]
Immunostaining showed the estrogen receptor - positive cells to be the macrophage - like synoviocytes and the CD8 +, CD29 + T cells both in RA and in control synovial tissues.	[]
Higher nuclear content of EBS was consistent with more intense nuclear staining of synoviocytes and T cells.	[]
CONCLUSION.	[]
It is conceivable that the immunomodulatory activity exerted by estrogens is at least partly mediated through their interaction with EBS that are present on macrophage - like synoviocytes, functioning as antigen - processing and antigen - presenting cells, and on antigen - experienced ( memory) CD8 + T lymphocytes ( CD29 +, CD45RO +	[]
