Five of these were caused by mutations predicted to produce a truncated protein: ( i) a sporadic case showed a 32 bp deletion in exon 11, and a mutant mRNA without exon 11 was produced; the normal exon 10 was also spliced out; ( ii) a sporadic case had a 1 bp deletion in exon 12 ( 1634delT); ( iii) a TSC2 - linked mother and daughter pair had a G - - > T transversion in exon 23 ( G2715T) introducing a cryptic splice site causing a 29 bp truncation of mRNA from exon 23; ( iv) a sporadic case showed a 2 bp deletion in exon 36; ( v) a sporadic case showed a 1 bp insertion disrupting the donor splice site of exon 37 ( 5007 + 2insA), resulting in the use of an upstream exonic cryptic splice site to cause a 29 bp truncation of mRNA from exon 37.	truncated protein,62,79,Gene/Protein	32 bp deletion,111,125,Gene/Protein	exon 11,129,136,Gene/Protein	mutant mRNA,144,155,Gene/Protein	exon 11,164,171,Gene/Protein	1 bp deletion,255,268,Gene/Protein	exon 12,272,279,Gene/Protein	1634delT,282,290,Gene/Protein	TSC2 - linked mother and daughter pair,302,340,Gene/Protein	exon 23,373,380,Gene/Protein	G2715T,383,389,Gene/Protein	exon 23,465,472,Gene/Protein	2 bp deletion,505,518,Gene/Protein	exon 36,522,529,Gene/Protein	1 bp insertion,561,575,Gene/Protein	exon 37,612,619,Gene/Protein	5007 + 2insA,622,634,Gene/Protein	upstream exonic cryptic splice site,664,699,Gene/Protein	29 bp truncation,711,727,Gene/Protein	mRNA,731,735,Gene/Protein	exon 37,741,748,Gene/Protein	"[{""token"": ""truncated protein"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""32 bp deletion"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""exon 11"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""mutant mRNA"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 155, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""exon 11"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 171, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""1 bp deletion"", ""start_span"": 255, ""end_span"": 268, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""exon 12"", ""start_span"": 272, ""end_span"": 279, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""1634delT"", ""start_span"": 282, ""end_span"": 290, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""TSC2 - linked mother and daughter pair"", ""start_span"": 302, ""end_span"": 340, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""exon 23"", ""start_span"": 373, ""end_span"": 380, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""G2715T"", ""start_span"": 383, ""end_span"": 389, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""exon 23"", ""start_span"": 465, ""end_span"": 472, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""2 bp deletion"", ""start_span"": 505, ""end_span"": 518, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""exon 36"", ""start_span"": 522, ""end_span"": 529, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""1 bp insertion"", ""start_span"": 561, ""end_span"": 575, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""exon 37"", ""start_span"": 612, ""end_span"": 619, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""5007 + 2insA"", ""start_span"": 622, ""end_span"": 634, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""upstream exonic cryptic splice site"", ""start_span"": 664, ""end_span"": 699, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""29 bp truncation"", ""start_span"": 711, ""end_span"": 727, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""mRNA"", ""start_span"": 731, ""end_span"": 735, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""exon 37"", ""start_span"": 741, ""end_span"": 748, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"	train
