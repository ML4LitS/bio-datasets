As this phosphorylation was independent of protein kinase C activity, we tested whether a calcium / calmodulin - dependent protein kinase ( CaM kinase) might phosphorylate the Ets - 1 protein after elevation of intracellular free calcium concentrations.	protein kinase C,43,59,Gene/Protein	calcium / calmodulin - dependent protein kinase,90,137,Gene/Protein	CaM kinase,140,150,Gene/Protein	Ets - 1 protein,176,191,Gene/Protein	"[{""token"": ""protein kinase C"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""calcium / calmodulin - dependent protein kinase"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""CaM kinase"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""Ets - 1 protein"", ""start_span"": 176, ""end_span"": 191, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"	train

However, while IL2 expression requires the contribution of Ca ( 2 +) - and protein kinase C - dependent signals, we report that activation of human IL4 transcription through the Ca ( 2 +) - dependent pathway is diminished by protein kinase C stimulation in Jurkat T cells.
