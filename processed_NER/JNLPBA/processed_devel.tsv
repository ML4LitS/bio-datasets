The Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV) transforming protein LMP1 appears to be a constitutively activated tumor necrosis factor receptor ( TNFR) on the basis of an intrinsic ability to aggregate in the plasma membrane and an association of its cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus ( CT) with TNFR - associated factors ( TRAFs).

Patients with HIV infections often show elevated circulating levels of cortisol, suggesting some misfunction in the regulatory systems that maintain the levels of this critical hormone.	[]
At the cellular level, it is known that both acute HIV infection and glucocorticoids can cause apoptotic cell death in thymic lymphocytes.	[]

We show here that the response of the HIV - 1 long terminal repeat ( LTR) to mitogenic or Tat - mediated activation is sensitive to the suppressive action of a Herpesvirus saimiri ( HVS) - transformed CD8 + T cell clone from an HIV - infected individual and supernatants from CD8 + T cells of HIV - 1 - infected asymptomatic subjects ( CD4 + > 350 / microliters).

Mutagenesis of NF kappa B or Sp - 1 elements within the LTR resulted in no change in the ability of CD8 + T cell supernatants to inhibit Tat - or mitogen - mediated LTR transcription.

Taken together, these observations suggest that mitogenic activation, mediated primarily through the NF kappa B enhancer, is susceptible to CD8 - mediated inhibition, however, inhibition of Tat - mediated activation may rely upon a different pathway that is NFAT - 1 dependent.

TNFalpha decreased ( P < 0. 001), while IL - 10 increased ( P < 0. 001), the concentration of dexamethasone binding sites in these cells, with no discernible effect on their binding affinity.

We conclude that glucocorticoids differentially modulate TNFalpha and IL - 10 secretion by human monocytes in a LPS dose - dependent fashion and that the sensitivity of these cells to glucocorticoids is altered by TNFalpha or IL - 10 pretreatment; TNFalpha blocks their effects, whereas IL - 10 acts synergistically with glucocorticoids.

To better clarify the molecular basis of IL - 12 action, we set out to characterize genes up - regulated by IL - 12, first by contrasting IL - 12 - and IFN - alpha - inducible genes.

In contrast, the RelA ( p65) subunit was barely detectable in monocytes, but its level increased markedly in MDMs.	[]
In MDMs, an upregulation of I kappa B alpha synthesis as well as the appearance of a novel M ( r) 40, 000 form of I kappa B alpha were also observed.

Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC) is an inhibitor of NF kappaB in most cells; however, we show that PDTC is also a potent scavenger of NO through formation of mononitrosyl iron complexes with PDTC.

Contrary to the results in Jurkat cells, PDTC did not inhibit tumor necrosis factor - alpha - induced NF kappaB activation in astrocytes; instead PDTC itself induces NF kappaB activation in astrocytes, and this may be related to scavenging of endogenously produced NO by the PDTC iron complex.

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV - 1) and HIV - 2 are structurally related retroviruses which both cause AIDS in humans.	[]
Although both viruses establish latency in quiescent human - peripheral - blood T cells, the asymptomatic phase of HIV - 2 infection may be more prolonged than that of HIV - 1.	[]
