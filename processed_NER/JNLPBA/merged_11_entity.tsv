A role for changes in immunophilins, causing glucocorticoid resistance in neotropical primates, is supported by the following: the changes in FKBP51 and FKBP52 were observed in cells from other neotropical primates with glucocorticoid resistance; the elevated level of FKBP51 was reflected in an abundance of FKBP51 in heat shock protein 90 complexes in SML; when cytosols of SML and L929 cells were mixed, the decrease in GR binding was associated with incorporation of FKBP51 into GR heterocomplexes; the effect of SML cytosol on GR binding was reproduced with cytosol from COS cells expressing squirrel monkey FKBP51; and both the effect of SML cytosol on GR binding and the incorporation of FKBP51 into GR heterocomplexes were blocked by FK506.	immunophilins,22,35,Gene/Protein	FKBP51,142,148,Gene/Protein	FKBP52,153,159,Gene/Protein	FKBP51,269,275,Gene/Protein	FKBP51,309,315,Gene/Protein	heat shock protein 90 complexes,319,350,Gene/Protein	FKBP51,471,477,Gene/Protein	GR heterocomplexes,483,501,Gene/Protein	FKBP51,613,619,Gene/Protein	FKBP51,695,701,Gene/Protein	GR heterocomplexes,707,725,Gene/Protein	"[{""token"": ""immunophilins"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""FKBP51"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""FKBP52"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 159, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""FKBP51"", ""start_span"": 269, ""end_span"": 275, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""FKBP51"", ""start_span"": 309, ""end_span"": 315, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""heat shock protein 90 complexes"", ""start_span"": 319, ""end_span"": 350, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""FKBP51"", ""start_span"": 471, ""end_span"": 477, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""GR heterocomplexes"", ""start_span"": 483, ""end_span"": 501, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""FKBP51"", ""start_span"": 613, ""end_span"": 619, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""FKBP51"", ""start_span"": 695, ""end_span"": 701, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""GR heterocomplexes"", ""start_span"": 707, ""end_span"": 725, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"	valid

A role for changes in immunophilins, causing glucocorticoid resistance in neotropical primates, is supported by the following: the changes in FKBP51 and FKBP52 were observed in cells from other neotropical primates with glucocorticoid resistance; the elevated level of FKBP51 was reflected in an abundance of FKBP51 in heat shock protein 90 complexes in SML; when cytosols of SML and L929 cells were mixed, the decrease in GR binding was associated with incorporation of FKBP51 into GR heterocomplexes; the effect of SML cytosol on GR binding was reproduced with cytosol from COS cells expressing squirrel monkey FKBP51; and both the effect of SML cytosol on GR binding and the incorporation of FKBP51 into GR heterocomplexes were blocked by FK506.	immunophilins,22,35,Gene/Protein	FKBP51,142,148,Gene/Protein	FKBP52,153,159,Gene/Protein	FKBP51,269,275,Gene/Protein	FKBP51,309,315,Gene/Protein	heat shock protein 90 complexes,319,350,Gene/Protein	FKBP51,471,477,Gene/Protein	GR heterocomplexes,483,501,Gene/Protein	FKBP51,613,619,Gene/Protein	FKBP51,695,701,Gene/Protein	GR heterocomplexes,707,725,Gene/Protein	"[{""token"": ""immunophilins"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""FKBP51"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""FKBP52"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 159, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""FKBP51"", ""start_span"": 269, ""end_span"": 275, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""FKBP51"", ""start_span"": 309, ""end_span"": 315, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""heat shock protein 90 complexes"", ""start_span"": 319, ""end_span"": 350, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""FKBP51"", ""start_span"": 471, ""end_span"": 477, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""GR heterocomplexes"", ""start_span"": 483, ""end_span"": 501, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""FKBP51"", ""start_span"": 613, ""end_span"": 619, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""FKBP51"", ""start_span"": 695, ""end_span"": 701, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}, {""token"": ""GR heterocomplexes"", ""start_span"": 707, ""end_span"": 725, ""type"": ""Gene/Protein""}]"	train

These studies have been extended to show that ( i) a mutant EBV strain lacking the gene encoding EBNA 2 fails to switch from Wp to Cp usage in primary B lymphocytes, although the virus contains a functional Cp; ( ii) a region from - 429 to - 245 base pairs upstream of Cp is essential for Cp activity in B lymphocytes, but only in the context of upstream and downstream sequences; ( iii) this region contains an EBNA 2 - dependent enhancer; and ( iv) DNase I protection employing nuclear extracts from B and T lymphocytes revealed a B - cell - specific footprint in the region of the EBNA 2 - dependent enhancer.
