Hydrogen sulfide and nitrogen gas were continuously supplied, whereas the oxygen and carbon dioxide dosing rates were pulse - wise controlled with a multiparameter transmitter ( Liquiline CM442 - 1102 / 0, Endress + Hauser, Germany) based on the signals from a redox sensor, equipped with an internal Ag / AgCl reference electrode ( Orbisint 12D - 7PA41; Endress + Hauser, Germany) and a pH sensor ( Orbisint 11D - 7AA41; Endress + Hauser, Germany).
