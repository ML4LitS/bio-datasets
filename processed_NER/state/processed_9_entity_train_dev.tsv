Data collection and statistical analysis We analyzed the microbiome in the sputum from thirteen clinically stable pediatric siblings from six families, of which eight siblings were MZ twins and five were siblings who served as proxies for DZ twins because they differed in age by less than 3years from the other child with CF living in the same household.
