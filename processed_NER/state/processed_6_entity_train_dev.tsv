Here, we evaluated and functionally characterized the fecal microbiome of IBD patients with or without peripheral SpA. Coupling the sorting of IgA - coated microbiota with 16S rRNA - based analysis ( IgA - seq) revealed a selective enrichment in IgA - coated E. coli in patients with Crohns disease - associated SpA ( CD - SpA) compared to CD alone.

To investigate these hypotheses, the virome capture sequencing for vertebrate viruses ( VirCapSeq - VERT) platform was employed to detect RNA transcripts from known and novel viruses in fresh frozen lymph node tissue from CD patients ( 12 UCD, 11 HHV - 8 - negative MCD [ idiopathic MCD; iMCD], and two HHV - 8 - positive MCD) and related diseases ( three T cell lymphoma and three Hodgkin lymphoma).
