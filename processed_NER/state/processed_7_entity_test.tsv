Blood ( serum lipid) analysis For triglycerides, cholesterol, LDL, and HDL levels, blood samples were taken prior to the start of the synbiotic supplementation and at one - month post - supplementation and submitted for serum lipid profile analysis.

Biogas production rate, biogas composition ( CH4, CO2, O2, H2, and H2S), VFA concentrations, total solids content ( TS), volatile solids content ( VS), and pH were determined as described previously ( Mulat et al., 2016).

Infants reported to have never been introduced to formula and to be breastfed were considered to be exclusively breastfed, while those who were ever breastfed and ever formula - fed were considered to be fed with a combination of breast milk and formula regardless of whether or not the infant was still breastfed at the time of stool collection.
