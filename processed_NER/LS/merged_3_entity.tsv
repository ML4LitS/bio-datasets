Major capsid protein fragments were sequenced with three strategies, i. e., clone - library Sanger sequencing ( about 100 reads), shallow Illumina sequencing ( 1, 0002, 000 reads), and deep Illumina sequencing ( more than 100, 000 reads).	clone - library Sanger,76,98,Library_source	shallow Illumina,130,146,Library_source	deep Illumina,185,198,Library_source	"[{""token"": ""clone - library Sanger"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Library_source""}, {""token"": ""shallow Illumina"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Library_source""}, {""token"": ""deep Illumina"", ""start_span"": 185, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""Library_source""}]"	test
The barcoded amplicons were quantified using a Qubit fluorometer with Quant - iT dsDNA BR assay kit ( Invitrogen, USA), and each amplicon was adjusted to equimolar concentration according to the Illumina protocol for 16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation.	amplicons,13,22,Library_source	amplicon,129,137,Library_source	16S Metagenomic,217,232,Library_source	"[{""token"": ""amplicons"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Library_source""}, {""token"": ""amplicon"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Library_source""}, {""token"": ""16S Metagenomic"", ""start_span"": 217, ""end_span"": 232, ""type"": ""Library_source""}]"	train
Methods Metagenomic datasets Sequencing of several shotgun metagenomic datasets as well as assembly and binning of the AGa genome bin was performed in its entirety in a previous study [ 9] and is briefly summarized here: the assembly of 268Gbp of HiSeq metagenomic sequence resulted in 179, 092 scaffolds, of which the 65 largest ranged in size from 0. 5 to 1. 5Mbp.

Bioinformatic analyses Sequence reads from 16S rRNA gene amplicons, nifH gene amplicons, and metagenomes were demultiplexed using the Illumina MiSeq Reporter ( MSR) version 2. 5. 1.	amplicons,57,66,Library_source	amplicons,78,87,Library_source	metagenomes,93,104,Library_source	"[{""token"": ""amplicons"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Library_source""}, {""token"": ""amplicons"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Library_source""}, {""token"": ""metagenomes"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Library_source""}]"	train
Metatranscriptome sequencing and analysis For the metatranscriptomic analysis, the RNA triplicate samples of the biofilm and planktonic phases were pooled again as described for 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing.
