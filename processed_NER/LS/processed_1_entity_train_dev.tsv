This size limit was imposed so that both 454 pyrosequencing and Illumina platforms could be used for amplicon sequencing.	"amplicon	101	109	Library_source"	"[{""token"": ""amplicon"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Library_source""}]"
Composition of the Bacterial Communities Bacterial community compositions of both CSTRs at the beginning and at the end of the experiment were analyzed by amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA genes.

Pooled amplicons from each replicate were confirmed by gel electrophoresis ( 1. 5% ethidium bromide - stained agarose gel), purified using Agencourt AMPure XP System ( Beckman Coulter, Beverly, MA, USA), and quantified in triplicate using the Quant - iT PicoGreen dsDNA assay ( Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).

The cDNA was sheared ( Covaris instrument) to a targeted ~ 225 bp insert size, and libraries were prepared using the TruSeq DNA ( Illumina) kit with custom indices developed by the Georgia Genomics Facility at the University of Georgia.

To address this limitation, a recently developed technique which couples the sorting of IgA - coated microbiota with 16S rRNA sequencing ( called IgA - seq) focuses analysis on microbiota identified by the immune system ( 19).

Amplicon preparation and sequencing were performed at BMR Genomics S. r. l.	"Amplicon	0	8	Library_source"	"[{""token"": ""Amplicon"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Library_source""}]"
Additional Information Accession codes: Sequence reads for the 16S - rRNA amplicon samples have been deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive ( SRA) under accession code SRR610826.	"amplicon	74	82	Library_source"	"[{""token"": ""amplicon"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Library_source""}]"
16S and metagenomic libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform.	"metagenomic	8	19	Library_source"	"[{""token"": ""metagenomic"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Library_source""}]"
