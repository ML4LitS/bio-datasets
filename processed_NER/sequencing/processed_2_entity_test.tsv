Sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeqPE250 platform ( Illumina).	"Illumina HiSeqPE250	31	50	sequencing"	"Illumina	62	70	sequencing"	"[{""token"": ""Illumina HiSeqPE250"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""sequencing""}, {""token"": ""Illumina"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""sequencing""}]"
In order to sequence the MCP gene on Illumina Miseq platform, Illumina adapter, primer pad, linker, and barcodes were added to the 5 ends of primer pairs according to a previous publication ( Caporaso et al., 2012).

Major capsid protein fragments were sequenced with three strategies, i. e., clone - library Sanger sequencing ( about 100 reads), shallow Illumina sequencing ( 1, 0002, 000 reads), and deep Illumina sequencing ( more than 100, 000 reads).

Additional sequencing was conducted at Los Alamos National Laboratory using Illumina GAIIx PE and HiSeq SE machines.
