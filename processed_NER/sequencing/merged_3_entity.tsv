The 454 pyrosequencing was carried out on the GS FLX + system using the XL + chemistry following the manufacturers recommendations ( Roche, Basel, Switzerland).	454 pyrosequencing,4,22,sequencing	GS FLX + system,46,61,sequencing	XL + chemistry,72,86,sequencing	"[{""token"": ""454 pyrosequencing"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""sequencing""}, {""token"": ""GS FLX + system"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""sequencing""}, {""token"": ""XL + chemistry"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""sequencing""}]"	train
It has previously been demonstrated that the 454 and Illumina platforms sample the same fraction of diversity and produce similar relative abundances of genes and genomes ( 63), although 454 does produce fewer reads per sequencing run ( addressed below).	454,45,48,sequencing	Illumina platforms,53,71,sequencing	454,187,190,sequencing	"[{""token"": ""454"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""sequencing""}, {""token"": ""Illumina platforms"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""sequencing""}, {""token"": ""454"", ""start_span"": 187, ""end_span"": 190, ""type"": ""sequencing""}]"	train
Sequencing of the amplified V3V4 region libraries was performed using a MiSeq next - generation sequencer ( Illumina) with 2250 nt paired - end technology ( PE), using the v2 Illumina kit.
