We found that overexpression of IkappaB - alpha in endothelial cells using a recombinant adenovirus prevented tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( TNF - alpha) - induced degradation of IkappaB - alpha and suppressed the upregulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule - 1 ( VCAM - 1), intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 ( ICAM - 1), and E - selectin mRNA and surface protein expression and the upregulation of transcripts for the chemokines monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 ( MCP - 1) and growth - related activity - alpha ( GRO - alpha) by TNF - alpha.

These results show that, physiologically, high levels of nuclear of p50, p52 and RelB are restricted to accessory cells of the immune system, which include FDC in GC, and DC and macrophages in the T cell zone, that specialized scavenger macrophages from GC do not have detectable levels of p52 and RelB, whereas macrophages from the T cell area, known to present the antigen to T cells, do have both nuclear p52 and RelB, and that in the T cell zone, p52 and RelB are located in nuclei of both CD1a +, CD68 + or both, cells APC, whereas p50 is restricted to CD1a - and CD68 - APC.	p50,68,71,Protein	p52,73,76,Protein	RelB,81,85,Protein	p52,290,293,Protein	RelB,298,302,Protein	p52,408,411,Protein	RelB,416,420,Protein	p52,451,454,Protein	RelB,459,463,Protein	CD1a,494,498,Protein	CD68,502,506,Protein	p50,537,540,Protein	CD1a,558,562,Protein	CD68,569,573,Protein	"[{""token"": ""p50"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p52"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RelB"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p52"", ""start_span"": 290, ""end_span"": 293, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RelB"", ""start_span"": 298, ""end_span"": 302, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p52"", ""start_span"": 408, ""end_span"": 411, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RelB"", ""start_span"": 416, ""end_span"": 420, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p52"", ""start_span"": 451, ""end_span"": 454, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RelB"", ""start_span"": 459, ""end_span"": 463, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD1a"", ""start_span"": 494, ""end_span"": 498, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD68"", ""start_span"": 502, ""end_span"": 506, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p50"", ""start_span"": 537, ""end_span"": 540, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD1a"", ""start_span"": 558, ""end_span"": 562, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD68"", ""start_span"": 569, ""end_span"": 573, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
