The immunosuppressive effects of glucocorticoids are largely due to transcriptional inhibition of immunologically relevant genes, such as the interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2) gene.	interleukin - 2,142,157,Protein	IL - 2,160,166,Protein	"[{""token"": ""interleukin - 2"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 2"", ""start_span"": 160, ""end_span"": 166, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
