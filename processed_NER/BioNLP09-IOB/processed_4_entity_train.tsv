In contrast, another inducible gene expression of monocyte chemotactic protein - 1 ( a CC chemokine) and the activation of the transcriptional factor ( FcRFgamma) bound to the gamma response region were similarly or less abundantly induced by IFNgamma treatment in PMA - or RA - differentiated U937 cells, indicating that increased IP - 10 mRNA induction was not due to the augmented ability of the cells to respond to the presence of IFNgamma.

However, it was only the IL - 2 promoter whose activation by Tpl - 2 was fully blocked by the dominant negative mutant MEK1S218 / 222A and the MEK1 / MEK2 inhibitor PD098059.

Our results show that Tax has at least two distinct activities on T cells, and suggest that Tax plays a crucial role in IL - 2 - independent T - cell transformation induced by HTLV - 1, in addition to its well - known IL - 2 - dependent cell transformation.

Since C3a has been shown to induce PGE2 production by monocytes, and PGE2 has been shown to influence cytokine production, we investigated the potential role of PGE2 in C3a - mediated enhancement of LPS - and IL - 1beta - induced IL - 6 production.

Promoter sequences responsive to cyclic AMP ( cAMP) are found in a number of cellular genes, and bind transcription factors of the cAMP response element binding protein ( CREB) / activating transcription factor - 1 ( ATF - 1) family.

Furthermore, a truncated form of NFAT1 acts as a dominant - negative, reducing IL - 4 promoter activity in primed CD4 T cells and confirming the importance of endogenous NFAT to increased IL - 4 gene expression by effector T cells.
