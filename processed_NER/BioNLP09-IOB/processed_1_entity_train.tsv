To test this apparent discrepancy, we realized that HTB and triflusal ( but neither aspirin nor salicylate) produced a concentration - dependent inhibition of COX - 2 protein expression in peripheral human mononuclear cells.

This observation was further confirmed in a rat air pouch model in vivo, in which both aspirin and triflusal inhibited PGE2 production ( ID50 = 18. 9 and 11. 4 mg / kg p. o., respectively) but only triflusal - treated animals showed a decrease in COX - 2 expression.

When human monocytes were preincubated with dexamethasone for 1 hour and then stimulated either with bacterial lipopolysaccharide or phorbol myristate, it was found that dexamethasone inhibited the lipopolysaccharide - induced interleukin - 1 beta protein production, but the phorbol myristate - induced production was increased 3 - 10 fold.

This was due to the presence of active NF - kappa B complexes in the nucleus of CD45 - T cells.	"CD45	80	84	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CD45"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Furthermore, we found that the induction by hydrogen peroxide of NF - kappa B translocation to the nucleus, which is assumed to be triggered by reactive oxygen intermediates, also coincided with incorporation of phosphate into the same subunits that were modified after stimulation by TNF - alpha.

Most of these cells have rearranged their heavy - chain locus but not their light chain genes, suggesting that an active v - abl protein interferes with this differentiation step.	"v - abl	121	128	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""v - abl"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To test this hypothesis, light - chain gene structure was examined in pre - B cells transformed by temperature - sensitive mutants of the Abelson virus and in derivatives that survive at the nonpermissive temperature because they express a human BCL - 2 gene.

Together these data demonstrate that the v - abl protein specifically interferes with light - chain gene rearrangement by suppressing at least two pathways essential for this stage of B - cell differentiation and suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation is important in regulating RAG gene expression.

We observed in the present study that lysoPC ( 1 to 10 micromol / L) dose - dependently reduced TF activity in human monocytes, as elicited by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS).	"TF	96	98	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TF"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Lysophosphatidylethanolamine ( lysoPE) and other lysophospholipids did not affect LPS - induced TF activity of human monocytes.	"TF	96	98	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TF"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
TF antigen expression as elicited by LPS was also lowered by lysoPC.	"TF	0	2	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TF"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 2, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
LysoPC inhibited the TF activity of Mono Mac - 6 cells to a similar extent as in the monocytes.	"TF	21	23	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TF"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In contrast, LPS - mediated nuclear binding of nuclear factor - kappaB / Rel to a TF - specific kappaB site was inhibited by lysoPC.	"TF	82	84	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TF"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Induction of TF mRNA expression by LPS tended to be partially reduced by the lysophospholipid.	"TF	13	15	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TF"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by pretreatment with 2 ' - deoxy - 3 ' - adenosine monophosphate partially reversed the inhibition of TF activity promoted by lysoPC.	"TF	133	135	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TF"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In conclusion, lysoPC markedly decreases LPS - mediated TF expression of human monocytes, the effect probably being mediated by both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms.	"TF	56	58	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TF"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
CD2 signalling induces phosphorylation of CREB in primary lymphocytes.	"CREB	42	46	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CREB"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We previously demonstrated increased HTLV - 1 transcription following CD2 but not CD3 receptor cross - linking.	"CD2	70	73	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CD2"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We hypothesized that this increased viral transcription was mediated, in part, through the phosphorylation of CREB.	"CREB	110	114	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CREB"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, we investigated CD2 and CD3 receptor - mediated signalling in primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC).	"CD2	27	30	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CD2"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
CD2, but not CD3, cross - linking increased cAMP detected by competitive enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) approximately fourfold.	"CD2	0	3	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CD2"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Consistent with post - translational regulation, no change in total level of CREB protein was observed.	"CREB	77	81	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CREB"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Phosphorylation of CREB occurred through a herbimycin A and Rp - cAMP - sensitive pathway, suggesting phosphorylation required antecedent activation of both protein tyrosine kinases ( PTK) and protein kinase A ( PKA).

Inhibition of NOS during the second A / R insult results in the generation of an oxidant stress similar to that observed after the first A / R challenge.	"NOS	14	17	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NOS"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Taken together, the findings of the present study are consistent with a role for NF - kappaB in the development of A / R tolerance ( with respect to PMN adhesion), perhaps by transcriptional regulation of GTP - cyclohydrolase.

Unstimulated MRL - lpr / lpr and C3H - gld / gld CD4 ( -) CD8 ( -) T cells constitutively contained high levels of two proteins that bound to the FLRE.	"CD4	49	52	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Involvement of mitogen - activated protein kinase pathways in interleukin - 8 production by human monocytes and polymorphonuclear cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide or Mycoplasma fermentans membrane lipoproteins.	"interleukin - 8	62	77	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""interleukin - 8"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In this report, we show that Mycoplasma fermentans lipid - associated membrane proteins ( LAMPf) induce the production of high levels of IL - 8 by THP - 1 ( human monocyte) cells and PMN at the same extent as LPS.	"IL - 8	137	143	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 8"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
T cell priming enhances IL - 4 gene expression by increasing nuclear factor of activated T cells.	"IL - 4	24	30	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 4"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As detected by in vivo footprinting, priming markedly increases the activation - dependent engagement of the P0 and P1 NFAT - binding elements of the IL - 4 promoter.	"IL - 4	150	156	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 4"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Moreover, each proximal P element is essential for optimal IL - 4 promoter activity.	"IL - 4	59	65	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 4"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Activation of the LTR in Jurkat cells was strongly enhanced by vanadate and inhibited by catalase, implicating H2O2.	"catalase	89	97	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""catalase"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In contrast, activation in THP - 1 cells occurred in the absence of vanadate and was unaffected by catalase.	"catalase	99	107	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""catalase"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The cotransfection of this LTR with a mutated IkappaBalpha molecule formally demonstrates that LTR transactivation is regulated by members of the Rel / NF - kappaB family in thymocytes.	"IkappaBalpha	46	58	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IkappaBalpha"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However IL - 7, a crucial factor for thymopoiesis that is secreted mainly by TEC, is a necessary cofactor for NF - kappaB activation elicited by TNF or IL - 1.	"IL - 7	8	14	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 7"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Together, these data indicate that NF - kappaB activation, required for a high level of HIV replication in thymocytes, is regulated in a specific manner in the thymic microenvironment which provides the necessary cytokines: TNF, IL - 1, and IL - 7.

In this study, we propose a novel function for CD44.	"CD44	47	51	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CD44"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
After a 72 - hour incubation with oleate and a further 16 - hour incubation with oleate plus 1 microg / mL LPS, VCAM - 1 expression was reduced by > 40% compared with control.	"VCAM - 1	112	120	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""VCAM - 1"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Oleate also produced a quantitatively similar reduction of VCAM - 1 mRNA levels on Northern blot analysis and inhibited nuclear factor - kappaB activation on electrophoretic mobility shift assays.
