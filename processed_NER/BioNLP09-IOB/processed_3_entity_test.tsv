Slight differences in the sequence of the core SRF binding site compared with that of the classical c - Fos promoter serum response element, together with differences in the spacing between the SRF and ETS motifs, appear to account for the inability of the SCMV SNEs to respond to serum induction.

Expression of other adhesion molecules such as lymphocyte function associated - antigen - 1 ( CD11a / CD18) and CD54 were unaffected.

Tepoxalin also inhibited the secretion of a NF - kappa B regulated chemokine, IL - 8, a known inducer of CD11b / CD18 expression.	"IL - 8	78	84	Protein"	"CD11b	105	110	Protein"	"CD18	113	117	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 8"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD11b"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD18"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus the suppression of CD11b / CD18 expression by tepoxalin may involve IL - 8.

The following transcription factors were studied: the Octamer factors Oct - 1 and Oct - 2, members of the AP - 1 factor family, NF - AT factors, in particular NF - ATp, and members of the Rel / NF - kB family.

Furthermore, GRbeta did not antagonize the repressive effects of GRalpha on IL - 2 promoter activity.

GRbeta can neither antagonize GRalpha - mediated transactivation nor transrepression in Jurkat cells, indicating a cell type - specific pattern of GRbeta - mediated antiglucocorticoid activity.
