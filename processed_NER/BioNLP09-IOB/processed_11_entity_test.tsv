Our results demonstrated that: ( i) PGN induced phosphorylation of the transcription factors ATF - 1 and CREB; ( ii) ATF - 1 and CREB bound DNA as a dimer and induced transcriptional activation of a CRE reporter plasmid, which was inhibited by dominant negative CREB and ATF - 1; ( iii) PGN induced phosphorylation of c - Jun, protein synthesis of JunB and c - Fos, and transcriptional activation of the AP - 1 reporter plasmid, which was inhibited by dominant negative c - Fos; and ( iv) PGN - induced activation of CREB / ATF and AP - 1 was mediated through CD14.

Recombinant I kappa B - alpha ( MAD - 3) inhibited the DNA binding activity of p65, p49 / p65, and p50 / p65 but stimulated the binding of NFKB2 ( p49) or NFKB1 ( p50).
