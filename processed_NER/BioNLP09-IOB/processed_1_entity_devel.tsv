The viral protein Tax induces the activation and nuclear translocalization of transcription factor NF - kappaB, which is proposed to play a crucial role in the transformation of T cells by HTLV - I.	"Tax	18	21	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Tax"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, the HTLV - I genes including Tax are not expressed significantly in primary leukemic cells from ATL patients.	"Tax	38	41	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Tax"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We found that leukemic cells from ATL patients, like HTLV - I - infected T - cell lines, display constitutive NF - kappaB DNA binding activity and increased degradation of IkappaBalpha ( an inhibitor of NF - kappaB).	"IkappaBalpha	172	184	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IkappaBalpha"", ""start_span"": 172, ""end_span"": 184, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Our results suggest that activation of NF - kappaB occurs through a Tax - independent mechanism in leukemic cells of ATL patients, possibly due to differential NF - kappaB subunit activation.	"Tax	68	71	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Tax"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Apoptosis - resistant T cells have a deficiency in NF - kappaB - mediated induction of Fas ligand transcription.	"Fas ligand	87	97	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Fas ligand"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Here we show that both a FasL - and a consensus NF - kappaB - reporter construct are inefficiently induced in these cells compared to wild - type cells.	"FasL	25	29	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FasL"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In addition, we demonstrate that the inducible transcriptional activity of the FasL reporter is abolished by specific inhibitors of NF - kappaB activation.	"FasL	79	83	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FasL"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, we could trace the deficit of the mutant cells to an inefficient NF - kappaB activation, evidencing a relevant role for NF - kappaB in the regulation of FasL expression in activated T cells.	"FasL	159	163	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FasL"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 163, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore, our results suggest that the induction of FasL versus cytokine gene expression is differentially sensitive to NF - kappaB deprivation.	"FasL	55	59	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FasL"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Reciprocally, inhibition of NF - kappaB activation by a soluble peptide inhibitor or a dominant form of the NF - kappaB inhibitor, IkappaB, makes the cells more susceptible to Fas - mediated apoptosis.	"Fas	176	179	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Fas"", ""start_span"": 176, ""end_span"": 179, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These observations were corroborated by studies on Fas - mediated death in primary T cells.	"Fas	51	54	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Fas"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Concanavalin A - activated cycling T cell blasts from mice that are transgenic for the dominant IkappaB molecule have increased sensitivity to Fas - mediated apoptosis, associated with a down - regulation of NF - kappaB complexes in the nucleus.	"Fas	143	146	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Fas"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In addition, blocking TNF, itself a positive regulator of NF - kappaB, with neutralizing antibodies renders the cells more susceptible to anti - Fas - mediated apoptosis.	"Fas	145	148	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Fas"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In summary, our results provide compelling evidence that NF - kappaB protects against Fas - mediated death and is likely to be an important regulator of T cell homeostasis and tolerance.	"Fas	86	89	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Fas"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Evidence for distinct intracellular signaling pathways in CD34 + progenitor to dendritic cell differentiation from a human cell line model.	"CD34	58	62	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CD34"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We have previously shown that protein kinase C ( PKC) activation ( with phorbol ester ( PMA) alone) specifically induces differentiation of primary human CD34 + hemopoietic progenitor cells ( HPC) to mature DC.

To further identify intracellular signals and downstream events important in CD34 + HPC - - > DC differentiation we have characterized a human leukemic cell line model of this process.	"CD34	77	81	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CD34"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Together, these findings demonstrate that cytokine or phorbol ester stimulation of KG1 is a model of human CD34 + HPC to DC differentiation and suggest that specific intracellular signaling pathways mediate specific events in DC lineage commitment.

IL - 2 - mediated cell cycle progression and inhibition of apoptosis does not require NF - kappa B or activating protein - 1 activation in primary human T cells.	"IL - 2	0	6	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 2"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 6, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The IL - 2 growth hormone is the major growth factor of activated T lymphocytes during a developing immune response.	"IL - 2	4	10	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 2"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

To determine whether either or both of these transcription factors are involved in cell survival or cell cycle progression in response to IL - 2, primary human T cells responsive to the growth factor were analyzed for NF - kappa B and AP - 1 activation.

These data suggest that, in this inflammatory model, initial activation of NF - kappaB occurs in alveolar macrophages and the ensuing production of TNF - alpha may propagate NF - kappaB activation to other cell types in the lung.

Cytokine rescue from glucocorticoid induced apoptosis in T cells is mediated through inhibition of IkappaBalpha.	"IkappaBalpha	99	111	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IkappaBalpha"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We now show that this differential rescue by specific cytokines in Th cells correlates with the level of IkappaBalpha that is regulated by DEX and cytokines.	"IkappaBalpha	105	117	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IkappaBalpha"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
