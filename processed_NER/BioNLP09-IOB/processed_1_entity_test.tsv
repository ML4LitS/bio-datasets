In contrast to that reported for human Jurkat T cells, we found that p38 MAPK, but not Jun NH2 - terminal kinase ( JNK), is weakly activated upon stimulation with either anti - CD3 or anti - CD28 in murine thymocytes and splenic T cells.

This prompted a study of follicular borders with Bcl - 6 staining in reactive follicular hyperplasias and follicular lymphomas to compare with AITL / GC.	"Bcl - 6	49	56	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Bcl - 6"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

A PMA responsive element was localized to a region between - 319 and - 219 bp upstream of the initiation codon and co - transfections with transcription factor expression plasmids for AP - 2 and Sp1 resulted in augmented ASM promoter activity, which was abolished when the binding sites for these two factors were deleted.

Our previous data have indicated that formylated indolocarbazoles which are formed by UV irradiation of tryptophan solutions are very potent Ah - receptor agonists.	"Ah - receptor	141	154	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Ah - receptor"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The results show that the CYP1A1 mRNA level induced by UV in the presence of tryptophan was higher than that induced by UV alone in both HaCaT cells and lymphocytes after 3 h of incubation post - UV irradiation.
