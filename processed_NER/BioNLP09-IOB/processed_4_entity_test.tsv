It is perhaps possible that all of Stat4 actions on Th1 development may be exert directly by Stat4 at the IFN - gamma gene, however we suggest that, more likely, Stat4 may act to induce Th1 development through the induction of other non - cytokine genes, whose stable expression maintains the transcriptional state of a Th1 cell.

To examine the hypothesis that interleukin - 6 ( IL - 6) contributes to PMN infiltration and lung damage in HS, we examined the lungs of rats subjected to unresuscitated and resuscitated HS for the production of IL - 6 and activation of Stat3.
