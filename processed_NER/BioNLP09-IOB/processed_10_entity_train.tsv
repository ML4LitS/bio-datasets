Results from in vivo expression studies performed with these NF - kappa B p65 mutants revealed the following: 1) I kappa B / MAD - 3 completely inhibits NF - kappa B p65 - dependent transcriptional activation mediated through the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 kappa B enhancer in human T lymphocytes, 2) the binding of I kappa B / MAD - 3 to NF - kappa B p65 is sufficient to retarget NF - kappa B p65 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, 3) selective deletion of the functional nuclear localization signal present in the Rel homology domain of NF - kappa B p65 disrupts its ability to engage I kappa B / MAD - 3, and 4) the unique C - terminus of NF - kappa B p65 attenuates its own nuclear localization and contains sequences that are required for I kappa B - mediated inhibition of NF - kappa B p65 DNA binding activity.
