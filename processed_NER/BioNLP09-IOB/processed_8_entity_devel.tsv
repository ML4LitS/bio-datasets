CD40 ligation on MM by CD40L - transfected murine L - cells or by a soluble CD40L fusion protein up - regulated their expression of intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 and MHC class I and class II molecules and their secretion of IL - 6, IL - 8, tumor necrosis factor - a, and granulocyte macrophage colony - stimulating factor and also induced a rapid activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB.
