Part of this process involves the prevention of the development of Th1 cells, which are a primary source of interferon gamma ( IFNgamma), a potent activator of monocytes and an inhibitor of Th2 proliferation.

Freshly isolated monocytes treated with the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid secreted high levels of IL - 6 protein, which coincided with enhanced binding activity of NF - kappa B as well as with phosphorylation and activation of the ERK1 / 2 and JNK proteins.

By using PD98059, we demonstrated that the Raf1 / MEK1 / ERK1 / 2 pathway did not affect the DNA binding of NF - kappa B but, rather, acted at the level of transcriptional activity of NF - kappa B.

Interestingly, it was shown that NF - kappa B - mediated gene transcription, both in the context of the IL - 6 promoter as well as on its own, was dependent on both serine kinase activity and interaction with c - Jun protein.

BACKGROUND: Studies from our laboratory have shown that the earliest stages of atherosclerosis may be mediated by an autoimmune reaction against heat shock protein 60 ( Hsp60).

The interactions of Hsp60 - specific T cells with arterial endothelial cells ( EC) require expression of both Hsp60 and certain adhesion molecules shown to be induced simultaneously in EC by mechanical and other types of stress.

In addition, aspirin and indomethacin, but not CyA, induced Hsp70 expression in HUVECs that correlated with induction of HSF - 1 activity.

These data provide the molecular basis for the notion that ( 1) part of the anti - atherogenic effect of aspirin may be due to the prevention of the adhesion of sensitized T cells to stressed EC; ( 2) that part of the atherosclerosis - promoting effect of CyA may be due to its potential as an inducer of Hsp60 expression and its inability to down - regulate adhesion molecule expression on EC; and ( 3) that down - regulation of MCP - 1 expression by aspirin may result in decreased recruitment of monocytes into the arterial intima beneath stressed EC.

The HSFE induced an area of enhanced DNase 1 hypersensitivity extending from the transcriptional start site to - 300bp of the artificial promoter and significantly increased the proportion of beta - globin promoters in an open chromatin configuration.

While inducing CD14 expression, VitD3 concomitantly suppressed the basal, PMA -, and RA - inducible CD23 expression in a dose - dependent manner.

Two distinct signalling pathways are involved in the control of the biphasic junB transcription induced by interleukin - 6 in the B cell hybridoma 7TD1.

In this work, we show that human peripheral blood T cells that are stimulated through the TCR and expanded with IL - 2 are unresponsive to IFN - gamma, as determined by a lack of activation of jak kinases and the transcription factor, STAT1 ( alpha), a signal transducer and activator of transcription.

The germline promoters ( Ko) located upstream of the J region gene segments of the kappa locus also contain an octamer motif ( containing a single base pair mutation and referred to as the variant octamer) which has been shown previously to bind Oct - 1 and Oct - 2 transcription factors in vitro.

Therefore we studied the expression pattern of LAZ3 / BCL6 by in situ hybridization with synthetic oligonucleotide probes in frozen tissue sections from five reactive lymph nodes and 38 B cell and non - B NHL.

Truncated forms of the NOTCH1 transmembrane receptor engineered to resemble mutant forms of NOTCH1 found in certain cases of human T cell leukemia / lymphoma ( T - ALL) efficiently induce T - ALL when expressed in the bone marrow of mice.

Unlike full - sized NOTCH1, two such truncated forms of the protein either lacking a major portion of the extracellular domain ( DeltaE) or consisting only of the intracellular domain ( ICN) were found to activate transcription in cultured cells, presumably through RBP - Jkappa response elements within DNA.

Unexpectedly, a second, stronger RBP - Jkappa - binding site, which lies within the intracellular domain close to the transmembrane region and significantly augments association with RBP - Jkappa, was not needed for oncogenesis or for transcriptional activation.

To evaluate the physiologic plausibility of these claims, we compared the abundance of the VDR mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs) between different VDR genotypes using a quantitative reverse transcribed polymerase chain reaction - based method.

The method is based on the coamplification of VDR cDNA and an internal standard consisting of known concentrations of a human VDR CDNA mutated at a BglII restriction site; the interassay coefficient of variation is 11%.

The concentration of the VDR mRNA was 10 ( - 8) to 10 ( - 7) g / g of total RNA in cell - sorted monocytes and in in vitro activated lymphocytes, but only 10 ( - 12) g / g of total mRNA in resting lymphocytes, establishing that the VDR mRNA determined by our method in PBMCs is due to constitutive expression in monocytes.
