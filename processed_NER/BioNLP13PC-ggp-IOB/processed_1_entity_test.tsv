Progression through and completion of mitosis require the actions of the evolutionarily conserved Polo kinase.	"Polo	98	102	Gene_or_gene_product"	"[{""token"": ""Polo"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"
Cdc5p accumulates in the nuclei of G2 / M - phase cells, and its levels decline dramatically as cells progress through anaphase and begin telophase.	"Cdc5p	0	5	Gene_or_gene_product"	"[{""token"": ""Cdc5p"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"
We report that Cdc5p levels are sensitive to mutations in key components of the anaphase - promoting complex ( APC).	"Cdc5p	15	20	Gene_or_gene_product"	"[{""token"": ""Cdc5p"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"
We have determined that Cdc5p - associated kinase activity is restricted to G2 / M and that this activity is posttranslationally regulated.	"Cdc5p	24	29	Gene_or_gene_product"	"[{""token"": ""Cdc5p"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"
These results further link the actions of the APC to the completion of mitosis and suggest possible roles for Cdc5p during progression through and completion of mitosis.	"Cdc5p	110	115	Gene_or_gene_product"	"[{""token"": ""Cdc5p"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"
By using these cell lines, we found that p73 can induce both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.	"p73	41	44	Gene_or_gene_product"	"[{""token"": ""p73"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"
ATM also contains a proline - rich region and a leucine zipper, both of which implicate this protein in signal transduction.	"ATM	0	3	Gene_or_gene_product"	"[{""token"": ""ATM"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"
Previous results have demonstrated that AT cells are defective in the G1 / S checkpoint activated after radiation damage and that this defect is attributable to a defective p53 signal transduction pathway.	"p53	173	176	Gene_or_gene_product"	"[{""token"": ""p53"", ""start_span"": 173, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"
The first step for both pathways is a dehydration reaction catalyzed by specific nucleotide - sugar dehydratases.	"nucleotide - sugar dehydratases	81	112	Gene_or_gene_product"	"[{""token"": ""nucleotide - sugar dehydratases"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"
These compounds are then the substrates of specific glycosyltransferases which are responsible for insertion of either L - fucose or L - rhamnose in the corresponding glycoconjugates.	"glycosyltransferases	52	72	Gene_or_gene_product"	"[{""token"": ""glycosyltransferases"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"
