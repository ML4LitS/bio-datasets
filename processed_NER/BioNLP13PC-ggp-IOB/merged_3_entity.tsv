The C - terminus of MyD88 interacts with the IL - 1 receptor and blocks NF - kappaB activation induced by IL - 1, but not by TNF.

Sequence comparison with other UDP - sugar pyrophosphorylases revealed that amino acid residues, Gly112, Gly114, Thr115, Arg116, Pro122, and Lys123 of ScUap1p are highly conserved in UDP - sugar pyrophosphorylases reported to date.

In support of this hypothesis, we found that treatment of cells with leptomycin B, which disrupted Cyclin B1 - CRM1 interactions, led to a marked nuclear accumulation of Cyclin B1.

Both CRM1 binding and the ability to direct nuclear export were affected by mutation of these phosphorylation sites; thus, we propose that Cyclin B1 phosphorylation at the G2 / M transition prevents its interaction with CRM1, thereby reducing nuclear export and facilitating nuclear accumulation.

Furthermore, we found that the transcriptional activities of p53, p73 alpha, and p73 beta to induce their common cellular target genes differ among one another.	p53,61,64,Gene_or_gene_product	p73 alpha,66,75,Gene_or_gene_product	p73 beta,81,89,Gene_or_gene_product	"[{""token"": ""p53"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""p73 alpha"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""p73 beta"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"	test
We identified Chk2, the mammalian homolog of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad53 and Schizosaccharomyces pombe Cds1 protein kinases required for the DNA damage and replication checkpoints.

Chk2 was rapidly phosphorylated and activated in response to replication blocks and DNA damage; the response to DNA damage occurred in an ataxia telangiectasia mutated ( ATM) - dependent manner.

These results demonstrate that ATM can bind p53 directly and is responsible for its serine 15 phosphorylation, thereby contributing to the activation and stabilization of p53 during the IR - induced DNA damage response.
