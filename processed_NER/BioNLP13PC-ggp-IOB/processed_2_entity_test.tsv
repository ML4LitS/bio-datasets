TSC1 and TSC2 proteins form a functionally interdependent dimeric complex.

The majority of disease - associated mutations targeting either TSC1 or TSC2 results in a substantial decrease in protein level, suggesting that protein turnover also plays a critical role in TSC regulation.

BACKGROUND: Toll - like receptors ( TLRs) are a family of type 1 transmembrane receptors, which can recognize different pathogen - associated molecular patterns.

The expression of TLR - 4 was paralleled by that of NF - kappaB in the liver and TNF - alpha in serum.

RESULTS: The combination of moderate - dose AMSCs and low - dose CsA was significantly more powerful than moderate - dose AMSCs or large - dose CsA alone in suppressing transcription and production of interleukin - 2 and interferon - gamma, activation of NF - kappaB, and proliferation of T lymphocytes.

In addition, AMSCs expressed a high level of Jagged - 1, which induced activation of Notch signaling in T lymphocytes, thus reducing NF - kappaB activity.

Since the optimal pH for processing was between 7 and 8, and E - 64 ( a cysteine protease inhibitor) and leupeptin ( a serine and cysteine protease inhibitor) both inhibited this processing by cell lysates, we hypothesized that a calcium - activated neutral protease, CANP, might be responsible for this processing.

HIF - 1alpha is the transcription factor mediating hypoxia responses that include induction of VEGF and related bone induction.

It was concluded that NF - kappaB - mediated inflammatory signaling is able to block HIF - 1alpha transactivation at HRE - encoding genes by direct competition for p300 binding at the promoter.

E3 - 14. 7K is recruited to TNF - receptor 1 and blocks TNF cytolysis independent from interaction with optineurin.

The adenoviral protein E3 - 14. 7K ( 14. 7K) is known as a general inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor ( TNF) - induced apoptosis.

We therefore hypothesized that binding of optineurin to 14. 7K and recruitment of both proteins to the TNFR1 complex is essential for protection against TNF - induced cytotoxic effects.

Phase I clinical trials of the soluble type I receptor and IRAP indicate that these have potential anti - inflammatory effects.

Cell cycle regulation of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae polo - like kinase cdc5p.

We have determined that the levels of Cdc5p, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae member of the Polo family of mitotic kinases, are cell cycle regulated.

The potential tumor suppressor p73 differentially regulates cellular p53 target genes.

p73, a potential tumor suppressor, is a p53 homologue.

To further characterize the role of p73 in tumor suppression, we established several groups of cell lines that inducibly express p73 under a tetracycline - regulated promoter.	"p73	36	39	Gene_or_gene_product"	"p73	129	132	Gene_or_gene_product"	"[{""token"": ""p73"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""p73"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"
We also found that p73 can activate some but not all of the previously identified p53 cellular target genes.	"p73	19	22	Gene_or_gene_product"	"p53	82	85	Gene_or_gene_product"	"[{""token"": ""p73"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""p53"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}]"
These results suggest that p73 is both similar to and different from p53 in their signaling pathways leading to tumor suppression.

ATM associates with and phosphorylates p53: mapping the region of interaction.

The proline - rich region has been shown to bind to the SH3 domain of c - Abl, which facilitates its phosphorylation and activation by ATM.

We have also cloned and fully characterized a human protein, formerly named FX, and an E. coli protein, WcaG, which display both the epimerase and the reductase activities, thus indicating that only two enzymes are required for GDP - L - fucose production.
