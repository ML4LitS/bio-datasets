To investigate the penetrance of p73 in gastric carcinogenesis, we analyzed the expression, allelotype, and mutation of p73 in five cell lines and 75 tissues.

To better characterize the mechanism of oatp - mediated organic anion uptake, we examined transport of taurocholate in a HeLa cell line stably transfected with oatp under the regulation of a zinc - inducible promoter ( Shi, X., Bai, S., Ford, A. C., Burk, R. D., Jacquemin, E., Hagenbuch, B., Meier, P. J., and Wolkoff, A. W. ( 1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 25591 - 25595).

Cyclin E, a partner of the cyclin - dependent kinase Cdk2, has been implicated in positive control of the G1 / S phase transition.

A human homologue of the checkpoint kinase Cds1 directly inhibits Cdc25 phosphatase.

The irradiation - induced decrease in Cdc25 activity was suppressed by wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol ( PI) 3 - kinases, and was dependent on the function of the gene that is mutated in ataxia telangiectasia.
