Our data show that phosphorylation at Ser20 reduces binding of the mdm2 protein, suggesting that a function of the Ser20 - kinase pathway may be to produce a stable pool of inactive p53 in undamaged cells which can be readily activated after cellular injury.

Whatever the level of Pgp glycosylation and the detergent used ( SDS or DM), the content in secondary structure deduced from deconvolution of CD spectra is almost the same for the three sources of Pgp and estimated to 43% alpha - helix, 16% beta - sheet, 15% beta - turn and 26% of other structures.

This provides a good framework for precise 3D structure modeling of Pgp by homology with proteins of known 3D structure, as it is illustrated here for the A motifs of the ATP - binding domains of Pgp.

The U266 and RPMI8226 cell lines contained a completely methylated p16 gene and the IM9 line had a partially methylated p16 gene.

We have previously found that alterations of the p16 gene, such as deletions and point mutations, are rare in primary multiple myeloma; none of the 16 samples included in this study had p16 gene alterations.

Interestingly, binding of von Willebrand Factor ( vWF) to purified GPIb in the presence of ristocetin and botrocetin in a standardized microtiter plate assay was not altered by partial or even by total deglycosylation.

These results suggest that deglycosylation has major structural impacts on GPIb, strongly impairing platelet - vWF interactions; however, vWF binding to isolated GPIb remains unaffected.

This polypeptide, which has not been identified as yet, is predicted to contain the complete amino acid sequence of the matrix protein, M1, as well as that of a small integral membrane protein, CM2.

The electrophoretic mobilities of P42 and P44 varied depending on virus strain, indicating that they are virus - coded.

Treatment of infected cells with tunicamycin and digestion of immunoprecipitated proteins with various endoglycosidases revealed that P42 is modified by the addition of a high - mannose oligosaccharide chain to generate P44.

These results, taken together, suggest strongly that P42 and P44 correspond to the 374 amino acid protein encoded by unspliced RNA segment 6 mRNA and its N - glycosylated form, respectively.

CPD - I consists of a single peptide chain of 471 amino acid residues, three disulfide bridges and nine N - glycosylated asparaginyl residues, while CPD - II consists of a single peptide chain of 481 amino acid residues, has three disulfide bridges, one free cysteinyl residue and nine glycosylated asparaginyl residues.

Both Ca2 + and Mg2 + stabilize CPD - I as well as CPD - II, at basic pH values, Ca2 + being most effective, while the divalent ions have no effect on the activity of the two enzymes.
