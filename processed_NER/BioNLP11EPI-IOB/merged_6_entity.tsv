Previously, we described an association between the MLL / SET1 complexes and a highly restricted, gene - specific DNA - binding protein Ap2delta that is required for recruitment of the MLL / SET1 complex to target Hoxc8 specifically.

This proapoptotic role of TGIF does not appear to rely on transcriptional modulation but instead is executed in conjunction with Itch / AIP4, an E3 ubiquitin ligase operating in TNF - alpha - induced apoptosis through its ability to target the caspase antagonist cFlip ( L) for degradation.

Several new compounds are now undergoing preclinical and clinical evaluation, with a particular focus on TLR7 and TLR9 activators as adjuvants in infection and cancer, and inhibitors of TLR2, TLR4, TLR7 and TLR9 for the treatment of sepsis and inflammatory diseases.
