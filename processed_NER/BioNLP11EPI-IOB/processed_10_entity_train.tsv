Interestingly, UL16 interacts with MICB, but not with the closely related MICA, and with UL16 - binding proteins ( ULBP) ULBP1 and ULBP2, which are only distantly related to MICB, but not with ULPB3 or ULBP4, although all constitute ligands for NKG2D.

The HIF - 1alpha subunit is regulated by O2 - dependent hydroxylation of proline residue 402, 564, or both, by prolyl hydroxylase domain protein 2 ( PHD2), which promotes binding of the von Hippel - Lindau protein ( VHL), leading to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation; and O2 - dependent hydroxylation of asparagine residue 803 by factor inhibiting HIF - 1 ( FIH - 1), which blocks the binding of the 300 - kilodalton coactivator protein ( p300) and CREB binding protein ( CBP).
