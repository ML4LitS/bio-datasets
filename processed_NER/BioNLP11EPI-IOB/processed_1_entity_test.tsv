Although modifications to chromatin during replication remain poorly understood, a number of recent studies have described acetylation of the histone H3 N - terminal alpha - helix ( alphaN helix) at Lys 56 as a modification that is important for maintenance of genomic integrity during DNA replication and repair.

Although PTEN phosphorylation at a cluster of C - terminal serine and threonine residues has been shown to stabilize the protein and inhibit polyubiquitination and plasma membrane localization, details of the regulation of ubiquitination are unclear.

To reveal the role of N - glycans in maturation of the Na, K - ATPase beta ( 2) subunit in the ER, the effects of preventing or modifying the beta ( 2) subunit N - glycosylation on trafficking of the subunit and its binding to the ER lectin chaperone, calnexin, were studied in MDCK cells.	"calnexin	252	260	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""calnexin"", ""start_span"": 252, ""end_span"": 260, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Preventing N - glycosylation abolishes binding of the beta ( 2) subunit to calnexin and results in the ER retention of the subunit.	"calnexin	75	83	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""calnexin"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Combined, but not separate, removal of sites 2 and 7 dramatically impairs calnexin binding and prevents the export of the beta ( 2) subunit from the ER.	"calnexin	74	82	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""calnexin"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Similarly, hydrophilic substitution of two hydrophobic amino acids in this cluster disrupts both beta ( 2) - calnexin binding and trafficking of the subunit to the Golgi.	"calnexin	109	117	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""calnexin"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, the hydrophobic residues in the proximity of N - glycans 2 and 7 are required for post - translational calnexin binding to these N - glycans in incompletely folded conformers, which, in turn, is necessary for maturation of the Na, K - ATPase beta ( 2) subunit.
