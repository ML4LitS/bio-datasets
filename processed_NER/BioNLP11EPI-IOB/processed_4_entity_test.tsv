Consistent with this, we observed for the first time in a mammalian system that USP5 makes a major contribution to Lys - 48 - linked polyubiquitin disassembly and that suppression of USP5 results in the accumulation of unanchored polyubiquitin chains.

Deubiquitination of CXCR4 by USP14 is critical for both CXCL12 - induced CXCR4 degradation and chemotaxis but not ERK ativation.

Most interestingly, CXCR4 - mediated chemotactic cell migration was blocked by either overexpression or RNAi - mediated knockdown of USP14, implying that a CXCR4 - ubiquitin cycle on the receptor, rather than a particular ubiquitinated state of the receptor, is critical for the ligand gradient sensing and directed motility required for chemokine - mediated chemotaxis.

Our observation that a mutant of CXCR4, HA - 3K / R CXCR4, which cannot be ubiquitinated and does not mediate a chemotactic response to CXCL12, indicates the importance of this covalent modification not only in marking receptors for degradation but also for permitting CXCR4 - mediated signaling.

Since ventralization of activin - induced animal caps can be blocked by coinjecting a dominant - inhibitory receptor for BMP2 and BMP4, we suggest a role for BMP1 and Xld in regulating the ventralizing activity of these molecules.

The p16INK4A ( p16) binds to both cyclin D - CDK4 and cyclin D - CDK6 and inhibits the progression of the cell cycle from G1 to S phase.

A monoclonal antibody against M1, like anti - CM2 serum, was able to immunoprecipitate both the P42 and P44 proteins.

Furthermore, the tryptic peptide map of either P42 or P44 was indistinguishable from the map of the mixture of M1 and CM2.

The amino acid sequences of serine carboxypeptidase I ( CPD - I) and II ( CPD - II), respectively, from Aspergillus niger have been determined by conventional Edman degradation of the reduced and vinylpyridinated enzymes and peptides hereof generated by cleavage with cyanogen bromide, iodobenzoic acid, glutamic acid cleaving enzyme, AspN - endoproteinase and EndoLysC proteinase.
