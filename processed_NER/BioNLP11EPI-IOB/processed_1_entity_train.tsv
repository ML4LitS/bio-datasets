PROCEDURES: Ligands with a methyl group on the alpha carbon of the cyclohexyl group ( SWAY) or the alpha carbon of the C2H4 linker ( ( R, S) - JWAY) were synthesized and tested for binding affinity and intrinsic activity at 5 - HT1A receptors.

Sequence alignments and mutational analyses of the peptides identified a hitherto undiscovered E6 - binding motif.	"E6	95	97	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""E6"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Intracellular expression of a peptide containing the novel E6 - binding motif resulted in inhibition of colony formation capacity, specifically of HPV16 - positive cancer cells.	"E6	59	61	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""E6"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

We report phosphorylated and ubiquitinated aggregates of TAR DNA binding protein of 43 kDa ( TDP - 43) in SH - SY5Y cells similar to those in brains of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitinated inclusions ( FTLD - U).

Importantly, we demonstrate that the mature form of endogenous SREBP1 is phosphorylated on Ser - 434.	"SREBP1	63	69	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SREBP1"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Glycogen synthase kinase - 3 phosphorylates Ser - 434, and the phosphorylation of this residue is attenuated in response to insulin signaling.	"insulin	124	131	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""insulin"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Interestingly, phosphorylation of Ser - 434 promotes the glycogen synthase kinase - 3 - dependent phosphorylation of Thr - 426 and Ser - 430 and destabilizes SREBP1.	"SREBP1	158	164	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SREBP1"", ""start_span"": 158, ""end_span"": 164, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, the degradation of mature SREBP1 is controlled by cross - talk between multiple phosphorylated residues in its C - terminal domain and the phosphorylation of Ser - 434 could function as a molecular switch to control these processes.

Therefore, E2 - mediated tethering of viral genomes to host chromatin has multiple roles: to partition the viral genome to daughter cells, to ensure that the genomes are retained in the nucleus, and to make certain that the genomes are retained in functionally active nuclear domains.

The intracellular transport and enzymatic activity, but not correct folding, of LPH - G1363S were partially restored by expression at 20 degrees C.	"LPH	80	83	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LPH"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Although the function ( s) of these ARD hydroxylations is unclear, expression of the ARD protein Notch1 was shown to compete efficiently with HIF CAD for asparagine hydroxylation and thus to enhance HIF activity.	"Notch1	97	103	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Notch1"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, the extent of hydroxylation among ARD proteins, and the ability of other members to compete with HIF - CAD for FIH, is not known.	"FIH	120	123	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FIH"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Based on the sensitivity of the glycosylated molecule to degradation with a glycoprotease from Pasteurella haemolytica and neuraminidase, three classes of epitopes have been identified.	"glycoprotease	76	89	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""glycoprotease"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Here we review recent observations that expression of both class I and II epitopes, but not class III epitopes, is impaired on mature myeloid CD34 - pos.	"CD34	142	146	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CD34"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In addition, cells from patients with CD34 - pos. acute myeloid leukaemia of FAB classification M4 - M5, i. e., leukaemic blast cells of relatively mature morphologic phenotype, also express less class I and II epitopes than class III epitopes.

Methane monooxygenase and related hydroxylases catalyze hydrocarbon hydroxylation at diiron sites structurally related to the one in R2.	"R2	133	135	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""R2"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In protein R2, the likely reaction site for dioxygen is close to Phe208.	"R2	11	13	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""R2"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The crystal structure of an iron ligand mutant R2, Y122F / E238A, reveals the hydroxylation of Phe208 at the meta, or epsilon -, ring position and the subsequent coordination of this residue to the diiron site.	"R2	47	49	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""R2"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Together, the structural data on these two mutants suggest two possible reaction geometries for the hydroxylation reaction catalyzed by these modified R2 diiron sites, geometries which might be relevant for the hydroxylation reaction catalyzed by other diiron sites such as methane monooxygenase.
