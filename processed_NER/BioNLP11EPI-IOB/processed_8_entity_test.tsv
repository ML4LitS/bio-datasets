Comparison of high resolution methylation maps suggests that CpG methylation - mediated direct interference with binding of nuclear factors LBF 2, 3, 7, AML1 / LBF1, LBF5 and LBF6 or methylation of CpGs within an E - box sequence ( where activators as well as repressors can bind) is not the major mechanism in silencing of the LMP 1 promoter.

It has been proposed that two acyl carrier proteins ( ACPs) - TaB and TaE - - and two 3 - hydroxy - 3 - methylglutaryl synthases ( HMGSs) - - TaC and TaF - - could constitute two functional ACP - HMGS pairs ( TaB / TaC and TaE / TaF) responsible for the incorporation of acetate and propionate units into the myxovirescin A scaffold, leading to the formation of beta - methyl and beta - ethyl groups, respectively.

As predicted, DeltataB and DeltataE ACP mutants revealed similar phenotypes to their associated HMGS mutants DeltataC and DeltataF, respectively, thus providing direct evidence for the role of TaE / TaF in the formation of the beta - ethyl branch and implying a role for TaB / TaC in the formation of the beta - methyl group.

Western blot, chromatin immunoprecipitation, methylation - specific PCR, and pyrosequencing experiments showed that repression of Dkk - 1 coincided with decreased H4K16Ac, increased H3K27me3, and recruitment of SirT1, EZH2, SUZ12, and Bmi1 without DNA hypermethylation within the Dkk - 1 promoter despite prolonged TSC exposures.

Furthermore, both co - immunoprecipitation and immunocytochemistry demonstrated that VEGF treatment increased the interaction between occludin and modulators of intracellular trafficking that contain the ubiquitin interacting motif, including Epsin - 1, epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 15 ( Eps15), and hepatocyte growth factor - regulated tyrosine kinase substrate ( Hrs).
