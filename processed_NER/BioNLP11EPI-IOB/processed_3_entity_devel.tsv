As a result of the previous in vivo exposure to ACTH, the net maximal production of glucocorticoids in response to ACTH ( by 10 ( 5) cells and 2 h incubation) increased from 660 + / - 33. 9 ng ( control group) to 1105 + / - 117. 9 ng for cells from ACTH - treated animals ( P less than 0. 001), whereas the apparent affinity of the steroidogenic response remained unchanged.

Since the latter effect cannot account quantitatively for the magnitude of the lasting effect of ACTH on the maximal capacity of adrenocortical cells to produce cortisol in response to ACTH, it appears that the prolonged influence of ACTH on cortisol biosynthesis should also involve a stimulatory influence of the peptide on earlier step ( s) of steroidogenesis.
