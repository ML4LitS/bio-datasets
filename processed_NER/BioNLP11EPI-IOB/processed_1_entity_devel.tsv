Methylated H3 Lys 4 ( K4) is a generally conserved mark for euchromatic, transcriptionally active regions, although the effect of this modification is likely also to depend on its distribution both within the euchromatic region and more specifically within a given gene.

This provides evidence that H3K36me2 is established during the initial instances of gene transcription, with subsequent transcription having at most a maintenance role.	"H3K36me2	28	36	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""H3K36me2"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Accordingly, newly activated genes acquire H3K36me2 in a manner that does not correlate with gene transcript levels.	"H3K36me2	43	51	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""H3K36me2"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

The majority ( 78%) of centres that interpreted their results either demonstrated the presence of macroprolactin in the specimen, or suggested it as a likely cause of the hyperprolactinaemia.

Dentatorubral - pallidoluysian atrophy ( DRPLA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by polyglutamine expansion within the Atrophin - 1 protein.	"Atrophin - 1	136	148	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Atrophin - 1"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To study the mechanism of this disease and to test potential therapeutic methods, we established Atro - 118Q transgenic mice, which express in neurons a mutant human Atrophin - 1 protein that contains an expanded stretch of 118 glutamines.	"Atrophin - 1	166	178	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Atrophin - 1"", ""start_span"": 166, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Consistent with the results from previous studies on transgenic mice that expressed mutant Atrophin - 1 with 65 glutamines, Atro - 118Q mice exhibited several neurodegenerative phenotypes that are commonly seen in DRPLA patients, including ataxia, tremors, and other motor defects.

Overexpression of wild - type human Atrophin - 1 could not rescue the motor and survival defects in Atro - 118Q mice, indicating that the mutant protein with polyglutamine expansion does not simply function in a dominant negative manner.

We hypothesize that many genes in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2 are regulated by DNA methylation and histone deacetylation.	"histone	106	113	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""histone"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Treatment with 5 - aza - 2 ' - deoxycytidine ( 5 - aza - dC) to inhibit DNA methylation with and / or Trichostatin A ( TSA) to inhibit histone deacetylation should allow us to identify genes that are regulated epigenetically in hepatoma cells.

The present work analyzes the involvement of these mechanisms in the expression of the U2af1 - rs1 imprinted gene during the differentiation process of embryonic stem ( ES) cells induced by retinoic acid.	"U2af1 - rs1	87	98	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""U2af1 - rs1"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
By DNA digestion with methylation - dependent or independent restriction enzymes and consecutive Southern blot, we have found that methylation of the U2af1 - rs1 gene increases in differentiated ES cells and in embryoid bodies.	"U2af1 - rs1	150	161	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""U2af1 - rs1"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, northern blot and real - time reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction analysis showed a higher expression of the U2af1 - rs1 gene in differentiated ES cells and in embryoid bodies than in undifferentiated ones.

Our results suggest that the expression of the U2af1 - rs1 gene would be regulated by changes in chromatin structure rather than by DNA methylation during the RA - induced process of differentiation of ES cells.

We found that dendritic cell - specific intercellular adhesion molecule - 3 - grabbing nonintegrin enhancement of virus replication can be modulated by the V1V2 length, the overall V3 charge and N - linked glycosylation patterns; similar results were observed with immature dendritic cells.

Viruses with higher V3 charges are more readily transferred to CD4 ( +) lymphocytes when the V1V2 region is longer and contains an additional N - linked glycosylation site, whereas transfer of viruses with lower V3 charges is greater when the V1V2 region is shorter.

In line with these observations, the inhibition of the proteasome reversed the GSK - 3 effects, indicating that GSK - 3 may target HIF - 1alpha to the proteasome by phosphorylation.

Porcine submaxillary mucin forms disulfide - linked multimers through its amino - terminal D - domains.	"submaxillary mucin	8	26	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""submaxillary mucin"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
COS - 7 cells expressing 1, 360 residues from the amino terminus of porcine submaxillary mucin were used to determine whether this region, containing the D1, D2, and D3 domains, is involved in forming mucin multimers.

This ability of the amino - terminal region of mucin to aid in the assembly of multimers is consistent with its amino acid identities to the amino - terminal region of human von Willebrand factor, which also serves to form disulfide - linked multimers of this protein.

A link between secretion and pre - mRNA processing defects in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the identification of a novel splicing gene, RSE1.	"RSE1	136	140	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RSE1"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Moreover, these data imply that Sar1p is a limiting component of the ER - to - Golgi transport machinery and suggest a way that secretory pathway function might be coordinated with the amount of gene expression in a cell.

The MTVP transgene promoter region is unmethylated when the transgene is on the active X chromosome and methylated when on the inactive X chromosome.	"MTVP	4	8	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MTVP"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Interestingly, the MTVP transgene is not detectably transcribed from the male X chromosome, although it is unmethylated, consistent with its availability for transcription.	"MTVP	19	23	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MTVP"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The TFN transgene promoter region is hypomethylated on both the active and inactive X chromosomes, consistent with its expression from both chromosomes.	"TFN	4	7	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TFN"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
