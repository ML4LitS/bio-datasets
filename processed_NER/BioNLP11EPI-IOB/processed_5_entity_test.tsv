In a recent study, we identified five tumor suppressive genes ( IRX1, EBF3, SLC5A8, SEPT9, and FUSSEL18) as frequently methylated in HNSCC biopsies using a global methylation analysis via restriction landmark genomic scanning.

A model of partnership co - opted by the homeodomain protein TGIF and the Itch / AIP4 ubiquitin ligase for effective execution of TNF - alpha cytotoxicity.

Moreover, we show that Itch / AIP4 can also stabilize the TGIF protein in response to TNF - alpha by triggering its monoubiquitination at lysine 259, thereby revealing the existence of a functional network that can evolve into a positive feedback loop for ensuring effective execution of the TNF - alpha apoptotic signaling.

These results supported the hypothesis that Cav - 1 mediates the action of endotoxin in suppressing ET - 1 - mediated eNOS activation and demonstrated that the manipulation of caveolae produces significant effects on ET - 1 - mediated eNOS activity in LSECs.

Pulse chase experiments indicated that progastrin is converted to G34 - Gly which then follows one of two pathways: ( a) hydroxylation of COOH - terminal Gly and conversion to G34 followed by cleavage yielding G17, or ( b) cleavage to G17 - Gly.
