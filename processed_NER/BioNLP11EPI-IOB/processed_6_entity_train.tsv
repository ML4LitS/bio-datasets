The coordinated induction of both IGF - I promoters by GH is accompanied by hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4 in promoter - associated chromatin, a decline in monomethylation at lysine 4 of histone H3, and recruitment of RNA Pol II to IGF - I promoter 2.

Analogous to calnexin, processing of glycan chains by glucosidase enzymes was required for initial association of TCRalpha and - beta proteins with calreticulin; however, several major differences were noted regarding interaction of calnexin and calreticulin chaperones with TCR proteins.
