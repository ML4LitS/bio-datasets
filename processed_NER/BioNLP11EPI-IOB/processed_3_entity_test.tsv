In the context of a nucleosome, H3 lysine 79 is located in close proximity with lysine 123 of histone H2B, a major site for ubiquitination by Rad6.

Since the histone methyl - lysine residues recognized by HP1 also serve as substrates for deacetylation by HDACs, the interaction of MITR and HDACs with HP1 provides an efficient mechanism for silencing MEF2 target genes by coupling histone deacetylation and methylation.
