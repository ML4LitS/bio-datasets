Extension of this analysis to primary tumors and the normal cerebellum revealed three major classes of epigenetically regulated genes: ( 1) normally methylated genes ( DAZL, ZNF157, ASN) whose methylation reflects somatic patterns observed in the cerebellum, ( 2) X - linked genes ( MSN, POU3F4, HTR2C) that show disruption of their sex - specific methylation patterns in tumors, and ( 3) tumor - specific methylated genes ( COL1A2, S100A10, S100A6, HTATIP2, CDH1, LXN) that display enhanced methylation levels in tumors compared with the cerebellum.

Interestingly, the altered histone modifications in Jmjd1a - deficient germ cells caused diminished cAMP - response element modulator ( Crem) recruitment to chromatin and decreased expression of the Crem coactivator Act and their target genes Tnp1 ( transition protein 1), Tnp2, Prm1 ( protamine 1), and Prm2, all of which are essential for chromatin condensation in spermatids.	histone,27,34,Protein	Jmjd1a,52,58,Protein	cAMP - response element modulator,100,133,Protein	Crem,136,140,Protein	Crem,199,203,Protein	Act,216,219,Protein	Tnp1,243,247,Protein	transition protein 1,250,270,Protein	Tnp2,273,277,Protein	Prm1,279,283,Protein	protamine 1,286,297,Protein	Prm2,304,308,Protein	"[{""token"": ""histone"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Jmjd1a"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cAMP - response element modulator"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Crem"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Crem"", ""start_span"": 199, ""end_span"": 203, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Act"", ""start_span"": 216, ""end_span"": 219, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Tnp1"", ""start_span"": 243, ""end_span"": 247, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""transition protein 1"", ""start_span"": 250, ""end_span"": 270, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Tnp2"", ""start_span"": 273, ""end_span"": 277, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Prm1"", ""start_span"": 279, ""end_span"": 283, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""protamine 1"", ""start_span"": 286, ""end_span"": 297, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Prm2"", ""start_span"": 304, ""end_span"": 308, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
