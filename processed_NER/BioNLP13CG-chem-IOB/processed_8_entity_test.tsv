Consistently, it was found that MOG rapidly decreased the intracellular glutathione ( GSH) content in a dose - dependent manner and the significance of GSH depletion in MOG - induced apoptosis was further supported by the protective effects of tert - butylhydroquinone ( tBHQ) and the facilitative effects of DL - buthionine ( S, R) - sulfoximine ( BSO).

The antiproliferative effect of HAH - cortisol on endothelial cells appeared independent of the glucocorticoid activity of the steroid since HAH conjugated to 5 beta - pregnane - 3 alpha, 17 alpha, 21 - triol - 20 - one, a steroid lacking glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid activity, was even more effective at inhibiting DNA synthesis by murine pulmonary capillary endothelial cells than was HAH - cortisol.
