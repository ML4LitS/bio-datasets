Under conditions mimicking the injection environment, the lipoplex - serum interaction was strongly dependent on helper lipid and ionic strength: lipoplexes prepared in 150 mM NaCl or lipoplexes with high ( greater than 33 mol%) cholesterol were found to aggregate immediately.

The 20 - HETE agonist markedly increased superoxide formation as reflected by an increase in dihydroethidium staining of EC, and this increase was inhibited by PEG - SOD but not by apocynin.

VDAs can be divided into biologics, such as ligand - based, and small - molecule agents; this second group includes small - molecule VDAs like flavonoids, such as 5, 6 - dimethylxanthenone - 4 - acetic acid ( DMXAA), and microtubule - destabilizing agents.

In spite of uncertainties regarding the mechanisms of carcinogenesis, several vitamins such as beta - carotene and vitamins A, C, and E, which can reduce the risk of cancer, have been identified, using animal and in vitro models of carcinogenesis.
