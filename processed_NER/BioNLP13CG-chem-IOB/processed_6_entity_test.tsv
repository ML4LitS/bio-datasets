Our findings suggest with a reduction of steroid hormones following ovariectomy, alternatively activated macrophage markers ( Fizz1 and Ym1) were reduced, with this effect being reversed with the administration of estrogen or progesterone; suggesting that with the reduction of steroid hormones macrophages are activated in a classical manner, promoting inflammation, whereas estrogen or progesterone are contributing toward macrophage activation in an alternative manner, driving wound repair, angiogenesis, and remodeling.
