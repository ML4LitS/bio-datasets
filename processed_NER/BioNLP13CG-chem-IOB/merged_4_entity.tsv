Furthermore, it was shown that thiol - containing antioxidants completely blocked MOG - induced mitochondrial DeltaPsim loss and subsequent cell apoptosis, while the inhibition of apoptosis by benzyloxy - carbonyl - Val - Ala - Asp - fluoromethylketone only partially attenuated mitochondrial DeltaPsim loss, indicating that MOG - induced redox imbalance is an early event upstream to mitochondrial DeltaPsim loss and caspase - 3 activation.	thiol,31,36,Chemical	MOG,82,85,Chemical	benzyloxy - carbonyl - Val - Ala - Asp - fluoromethylketone,193,252,Chemical	MOG,325,328,Chemical	"[{""token"": ""thiol"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""MOG"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""benzyloxy - carbonyl - Val - Ala - Asp - fluoromethylketone"", ""start_span"": 193, ""end_span"": 252, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""MOG"", ""start_span"": 325, ""end_span"": 328, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"	test
Also, the combination of docetaxel and ATRA might allow a reduction in docetaxel doses and by this way may diminish docetaxel adverse effects while maintaining the therapeutic effect in patients with HRPC.	docetaxel,25,34,Chemical	ATRA,39,43,Chemical	docetaxel,71,80,Chemical	docetaxel,116,125,Chemical	"[{""token"": ""docetaxel"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""ATRA"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""docetaxel"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""docetaxel"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"	test
