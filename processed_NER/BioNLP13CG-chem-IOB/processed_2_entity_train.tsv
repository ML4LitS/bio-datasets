Upon retroviral transduction of the mouse c - myc gene, Rat 6 cells showed mildly altered morphology and formed microcolonies in soft agar; furthermore, they could be transformed by BP and MNNG to form large colonies in agar ( Hsiao et al.

In the current report, we tested the sensitivity of the c - myc - overexpressing cells ( Rat 6 / c - myc) to two additional chemicals: 5 - azacytidine and MnSO4.

Transformants induced by 5 - azacytidine lost c - myc - induced apoptotic cell death, whereas MnSO4 - induced transformants showed a higher degree of apoptosis than the parental Rat 6 / c - myc cells.
