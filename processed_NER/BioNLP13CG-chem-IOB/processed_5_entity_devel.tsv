In this study we separated weakly acidic phenolic components from other neutral, acidic and basic components of tobacco smoke condensate ( TSC) and observed that phenolic fraction of TSC significantly increased the number of colonies of promotion - sensitive JB6 Cl41 cells that showed anchorage - independent growth on soft agar in response to BPDE ( an ultimate carcinogen produced by metabolic activation of the PAH benzo [ a] pyrene).

Our initial investigations show that the naturally occurring organoselenium compound selenomethionine ( SM) and the synthetic 1, 4 - phenylenebis ( methylene) selenocyanate ( p - XSC) can inhibit human prostate cancer cell viability; however, in contrast to SM, p - XSC is active at physiologically relevant doses.
