UFT, an anticancer agent that is composed of tegafur ( FT) and uracil at a molar ratio of 1: 4, is widely used in clinical practice in Japan to treat cancer patients requiring a long - term chemotherapy, and it is associated with few side effects, if any.

Cediranib ( RECENTIN; AZD2171) is an inhibitor of VEGF signaling that has been shown in experimental models to prevent VEGF - A - induced angiogenesis and primary tumor growth, yet the effects of cediranib on VEGF receptor ( VEGFR) - 3 - mediated endothelial cell function and lymphangiogenesis are unknown.
