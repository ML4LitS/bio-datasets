Very recently, sunitinib has been shown to be an active agent for the treatment of malignant pheochromocytomas.	sunitinib,15,24,Chemical	"[{""token"": ""sunitinib"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"	train
However, it is unclear whether sunitinib acts only through an antiangiogenic mechanism or whether it may also directly target tumor cells.	sunitinib,31,40,Chemical	"[{""token"": ""sunitinib"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"	train

Furthermore, in support of these findings, we found that sunitinib induced a reduction in the expression of the antiapoptotic molecule Bcl - 2 as well as dephosphorylation of the proapoptotic molecule BAD, which results in the activation of BAD in these cells.	sunitinib,57,66,Chemical	"[{""token"": ""sunitinib"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"	train
Consistent with these apoptotic effects, our results showed that sunitinib inhibited phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR and was followed by a reduction of S6K1, which is a well - known target of mTOR.	sunitinib,65,74,Chemical	"[{""token"": ""sunitinib"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"	train
Knockdown of VEGFR - 2 attenuated the sunitinib - induced effects, including apoptosis and inhibition of signaling pathways such as the phosphorylation of Akt as well as mTOR, and Bcl - 2, which confirmed that these effects could be mediated by VEGFR - 2.	sunitinib,38,47,Chemical	"[{""token"": ""sunitinib"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"	train
In addition, silencing of S6K1 induced apoptosis accompanied by a decrease in the phosphorylation of BAD and Bcl - 2, similar to that observed with sunitinib treatment.	sunitinib,148,157,Chemical	"[{""token"": ""sunitinib"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"	train
Thus, these results together suggest that sunitinib initially exerts its apoptotic effect through the inhibition of VEGFR - 2, which, when followed by reduction of its downstream effectors, including Akt / mTOR / S6K1, may lead to inhibition of the antiapoptotic molecule Bcl - 2 and activation of the proapoptotic molecule BAD in PC12 cells.	sunitinib,42,51,Chemical	"[{""token"": ""sunitinib"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"	train

For electron microscopic examination the cell suspensions were then incubated with gold - labeled antirabbit antibody.	gold,83,87,Chemical	"[{""token"": ""gold"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"	test
The initial wave of ERK activity ( 5 - 120 min) was refractory to integrin antagonists, whereas the sustained activity ( 4 - 20 h) depended on integrin alphavbeta3, but not beta1 integrins.	integrin antagonists,66,86,Chemical	"[{""token"": ""integrin antagonists"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"	test
The lead oxide group revealed extensive growth of blood vessels from the latissimus graft into the experimental fat pad.	lead oxide,4,14,Chemical	"[{""token"": ""lead oxide"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"	test
While the response to most treatments was not affected by the VHL gene status, glucose deprivation was found to be much more cytotoxic for RCC cells lacking VHL gene function than for wtVHL - expressing cells.	glucose,79,86,Chemical	"[{""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"	test
The heightened sensitivity of VHL - deficient cells was not attributed to dissimilar energy requirements or to differences in glucose uptake, but more likely reflects a lesser ability of VHL - deficient cells to handle abnormally processed proteins arising from impaired glycosylation.	glucose,126,133,Chemical	"[{""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"	test
Furthermore, ubiquitination of cellular proteins was elevated in VHL - deficient cells, particularly after glucose deprivation, supporting a role for the VHL gene in ubiquitin - mediated proteolysis.	glucose,107,114,Chemical	"[{""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"	test
