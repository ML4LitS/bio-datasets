Sunitinib induces apoptosis in pheochromocytoma tumor cells by inhibiting VEGFR2 / Akt / mTOR / S6K1 pathways through modulation of Bcl - 2 and BAD.	"Sunitinib	0	9	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Sunitinib"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Sunitinib is an oral multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor with antiangiogenic and antitumor activity that mainly targets vascular endothelial growth factor receptors ( VEGFRs).	"Sunitinib	0	9	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Sunitinib"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Very recently, sunitinib has been shown to be an active agent for the treatment of malignant pheochromocytomas.	"sunitinib	15	24	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""sunitinib"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
However, it is unclear whether sunitinib acts only through an antiangiogenic mechanism or whether it may also directly target tumor cells.	"sunitinib	31	40	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""sunitinib"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Sunitinib markedly induced apoptosis of PC12 cells in a dose - dependent and time - dependent manner.	"Sunitinib	0	9	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Sunitinib"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Furthermore, in support of these findings, we found that sunitinib induced a reduction in the expression of the antiapoptotic molecule Bcl - 2 as well as dephosphorylation of the proapoptotic molecule BAD, which results in the activation of BAD in these cells.	"sunitinib	57	66	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""sunitinib"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Consistent with these apoptotic effects, our results showed that sunitinib inhibited phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR and was followed by a reduction of S6K1, which is a well - known target of mTOR.	"sunitinib	65	74	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""sunitinib"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Knockdown of VEGFR - 2 attenuated the sunitinib - induced effects, including apoptosis and inhibition of signaling pathways such as the phosphorylation of Akt as well as mTOR, and Bcl - 2, which confirmed that these effects could be mediated by VEGFR - 2.	"sunitinib	38	47	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""sunitinib"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
In addition, silencing of S6K1 induced apoptosis accompanied by a decrease in the phosphorylation of BAD and Bcl - 2, similar to that observed with sunitinib treatment.	"sunitinib	148	157	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""sunitinib"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Thus, these results together suggest that sunitinib initially exerts its apoptotic effect through the inhibition of VEGFR - 2, which, when followed by reduction of its downstream effectors, including Akt / mTOR / S6K1, may lead to inhibition of the antiapoptotic molecule Bcl - 2 and activation of the proapoptotic molecule BAD in PC12 cells.

PURPOSE: We studied retrospectively the interaction between c - erbB2 overexpression and adjuvant tomoxifen in node - negative breast cancer patients enrolled in the Gruppo Universitario Napoletano 1 ( GUN - 1) trial.	"tomoxifen	98	107	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""tomoxifen"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
PATIENTS AND METHODS: c - erbB2, evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 145 of 173 patients randomly assigned to 2 - year adjuvant tamoxifen or no further therapy, was considered overexpressed if greater than 10% of the cells showed specific membrane staining.	"tamoxifen	129	138	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""tamoxifen"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
At univariate analysis, overexpression of c - erbB2 did not affect either DFS or OAS; tamoxifen had a greater effect on reducing the risk of recurrence than of death.	"tamoxifen	86	95	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""tamoxifen"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Addition of c - erbB2 to a multivariate Cox model that contained menopausal status, tumor size, nuclear grade, and treatment as covariates did not affect the significance of the model for DSF or OAS, whereas addition of the first - order interaction between c - erbB2 and tamoxifen was statistically significant both for DFS and OAS.	"tamoxifen	272	281	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""tamoxifen"", ""start_span"": 272, ""end_span"": 281, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
The same result was obtained when the model contained ER status and ER - tamoxifen interaction.	"tamoxifen	73	82	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""tamoxifen"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Indeed, adjuvant tamoxifen significantly prolonged DFS and OAS in c - erbB2 - negative cases, whereas it had no effect on DFS and OAS in c - erbB2 - positive patients.	"tamoxifen	17	26	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""tamoxifen"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
CONCLUSION: In early - stage breast cancer patients, overexpression of c - erbB2 is a marker of lack of efficacy of adjuvant tamoxifen.	"tamoxifen	125	134	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""tamoxifen"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"

Glucose metabolism and amino acid uptake of the brain tumours correlated significantly ( r = 0. 71, P < 0. 001).	"Glucose	0	7	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Glucose"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
It is concluded that there is no major difference between the PET investigation of glucose metabolism and the less expensive SPET measurement of amino acid uptake in terms of their accuracy in evaluating the malignancy grade of primary brain tumours.

This encourages the performance of further studies to analyse the potential impact of 123I - IMT SPET on the therapeutic management of patients with brain tumours.	"123I - IMT	86	96	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""123I - IMT"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
For the purpose of investigating the relationship between the metastatic potential of the tumor as well as the expression of nm23 - H1 mRNA, and for determing the location of the positive sites in the cells, tumor metastasis suppressor gene nm23 - H1 in human hepatocellular carcinoma ( and the nonneoplastic area surrounding the tumor) was detected by in situ hybridization using digoxiginin - labeled nm23 - H1 antisense complementary RNA probe.

Baseline and pentagastrin - stimulated calcitonin levels were preoperatively determined in all cases.	"pentagastrin	13	25	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""pentagastrin"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
The mean baseline calcitonin level correlated with the histologic findings ( r = 0. 71, P = 0. 003) but there was no correlation between pentagastrin - stimulated calcitonin levels and histology ( r = 0. 21, P = 0. 47).

Activation of Ca2 + entry is known to produce endothelial cell shape change, leading to increased permeability, leukocyte migration, and initiation of angiogenesis in conduit - vessel endothelial cells.	"Ca2 +	14	19	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Ca2 +"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
The mode of Ca2 + entry regulating cell shape is unknown.	"Ca2 +	12	17	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Ca2 +"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
We hypothesized that activation of store - operated Ca2 + channels ( SOCs) is sufficient to promote cell shape change necessary for these processes.	"Ca2 +	52	57	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Ca2 +"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
SOC activation in rat pulmonary arterial endothelial cells increased free cytosolic Ca2 + that was dependent on a membrane current having a net inward component of 5. 45 + / - 0. 90 pA / pF at - 80 mV.	"Ca2 +	84	89	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Ca2 +"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Changes in endothelial cell shape accompanied SOC activation and were dependent on Ca2 + entry - induced reconfiguration of peripheral ( cortical) filamentous actin ( F - actin).	"Ca2 +	83	88	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Ca2 +"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Because the identity of pulmonary endothelial SOCs is unknown, but mammalian homologues of the Drosophila melanogaster transient receptor potential ( trp) gene have been proposed to form Ca2 + entry channels in nonexcitable cells, we performed RT - PCR using Trp oligonucleotide primers in both rat and human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells.	"Ca2 +	187	192	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Ca2 +"", ""start_span"": 187, ""end_span"": 192, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Our study indicates that 1) Ca2 + entry in pulmonary endothelial cells through SOCs produces cell shape change that is dependent on site - specific rearrangement of the microfilamentous cytoskeleton and 2) Trp1 may be a component of pulmonary endothelial SOCs.
