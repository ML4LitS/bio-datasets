RESULTS: We report that p53beta and Delta40p53 were expressed in the majority of melanoma cell lines at the mRNA level, but were absent or expressed at low levels in fibroblasts and melanocytes, suggesting that their expression may play a role in melanoma development.

Ionizing radiation, but not ultraviolet radiation, rapidly enhanced this p53 - directed kinase activity of endogenous ATM.

Treatment of cells with these oligonucleotides caused the selective accumulation of p21 and cyclin D proteins.

BACKGROUND: Mitogen - activated protein ( MAP) kinases ( or extracellular signal regulated kinases; Erks) and stress - activated protein ( SAP) kinases mediate cellular responses to a wide variety of signals.

This translocation to the nucleus is essential to MAP kinase signalling because it enables the kinase to phosphorylate transcription factors.
