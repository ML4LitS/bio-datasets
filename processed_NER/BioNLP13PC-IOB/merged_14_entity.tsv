Two complexes of mTOR have been identified: complex 1, consisting of mTOR - Raptor ( regulatory associated protein of mTOR) - mLST8 ( termed mTORC1), and complex 2, comprising mTOR - Rictor ( rapamycininsensitive companion of mTOR) - mLST8 - Sin1 ( termed mTORC2).	mTOR,17,21,Gene_or_gene_product	complex 1,44,53,Complex	mTOR,69,73,Gene_or_gene_product	Raptor,76,82,Gene_or_gene_product	regulatory associated protein of mTOR,85,122,Gene_or_gene_product	mLST8,126,131,Gene_or_gene_product	mTORC1,141,147,Complex	complex 2,154,163,Complex	mTOR,176,180,Gene_or_gene_product	Rictor,183,189,Gene_or_gene_product	rapamycininsensitive companion of mTOR,192,230,Gene_or_gene_product	mLST8,234,239,Gene_or_gene_product	Sin1,242,246,Gene_or_gene_product	mTORC2,256,262,Complex	"[{""token"": ""mTOR"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""complex 1"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Complex""}, {""token"": ""mTOR"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""Raptor"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""regulatory associated protein of mTOR"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""mLST8"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""mTORC1"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 147, ""type"": ""Complex""}, {""token"": ""complex 2"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 163, ""type"": ""Complex""}, {""token"": ""mTOR"", ""start_span"": 176, ""end_span"": 180, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""Rictor"", ""start_span"": 183, ""end_span"": 189, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""rapamycininsensitive companion of mTOR"", ""start_span"": 192, ""end_span"": 230, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""mLST8"", ""start_span"": 234, ""end_span"": 239, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""Sin1"", ""start_span"": 242, ""end_span"": 246, ""type"": ""Gene_or_gene_product""}, {""token"": ""mTORC2"", ""start_span"": 256, ""end_span"": 262, ""type"": ""Complex""}]"	train
