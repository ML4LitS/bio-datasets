The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA ( sodium - dependent multivitamin transporter ( SMVT)) predicts a protein of 68. 6 kDa with 634 amino acids and 12 potential transmembrane domains.

These results demonstrate that the UAP1 genes indeed specify eukaryotic UDP - GlcNAc pyrophosphorylase and that phosphomutase reaction precedes uridyltransfer.

We have determined that the levels of Cdc5p, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae member of the Polo family of mitotic kinases, are cell cycle regulated.

Cdc5p accumulates in the nuclei of G2 / M - phase cells, and its levels decline dramatically as cells progress through anaphase and begin telophase.

These results further link the actions of the APC to the completion of mitosis and suggest possible roles for Cdc5p during progression through and completion of mitosis.
