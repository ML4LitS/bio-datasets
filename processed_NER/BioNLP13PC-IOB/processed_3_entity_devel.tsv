Also consistent with the two - hybrid results, Hsl7 coimmunoprecipitates with full - length Hsl1 less efficiently than with a C - terminal fragment of Hsl1.

PAG608 encodes a nuclear zinc finger protein, which appears to localize preferentially to nucleoli when expressed at moderate levels in transfected cells.

Together with additional p53 target genes, PAG608 may therefore play a role in mediating the biological activities of p53.

Cdc53 is a scaffold protein for multiple Cdc34 / Skp1 / F - box proteincomplexes that regulate cell division and methionine biosynthesis in yeast.

Cdc53 contains independent binding sites for Cdc34 and Skp1 suggesting it functions as a scaffold protein within an E2 / E3 core complex.

In a yeast - based screen designed to identify human proteins that interact with human cyclin E, we identified components of the eukaryotic cytosolic chaperonin CCT.

BACKGROUND: In human cells, the mitosis - inducing kinase Cdc2 is inhibited by phosphorylation on Thr14 and Tyr15.

Phosphorylation of these sites is controlled by the opposing activities of the Wee1 / Myt1 kinases and the Cdc25 phosphatase.

The irradiation - induced decrease in Cdc25 activity was suppressed by wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol ( PI) 3 - kinases, and was dependent on the function of the gene that is mutated in ataxia telangiectasia.
