The SIR1 gene is one of four specialized genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae required for repressing transcription at the silent mating - type cassettes, HMLalpha and HMRa, by a mechanism known as silencing.

FKH1 was isolated as a gene that, when expressed in multiple copies, could substitute for the function of SIR1 in silencing HMRa.

Deletion of FKH1 caused a defect in silencing HMRa, indicating that FKH1 has a positive role in silencing.

Although FKH2 is redundant with FKH1 in controlling pseudohyphal growth, the two genes have different functions in silencing HMRa.

Interestingly, deletions in either FKH1 or FKH2 alone caused subtle but opposite effects on cell - cycle progression and CLB2 mRNA expression, consistent with a role for each of these genes in modulating the cell cycle and having opposing effects on silencing.

Analysis of promoter binding by the E2F and pRB families in vivo: distinct E2F proteins mediate activation and repression.

The E2F transcription factor plays a pivotal role in the timely activation of gene expression during mammalian cell cycle progression, whereas pRB and related proteins control cell growth in part through the ability to block the action of E2F.

These findings suggest that repression and activation of E2F - responsive genes may occur through distinct E2F heterodimers that direct the sequential recruitment of enzymes able to deacetylate and then acetylate core histones.

Importin alpha3 and alpha4 are close relatives in the human importin alpha family.

The potential for PTEN to regulate transcription of the large rRNAs by RNA polymerase I ( RNA Pol I) was investigated.

However, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that PTEN differentially reduces the occupancy of the SL1 subunits on the rRNA gene promoter.

However, studies in other organisms have suggested that activation of Polo kinase is dependent upon Cdk1 and therefore occurs downstream of Cdk1 activation.

Furthermore, purified Cdc28 associated with the mitotic cyclin Clb2 is sufficient to activate purified Cdc5 in vitro.

Hdm2 synthesis is itself tightly controlled and, as demonstrated by a recently described SNP ( SNP309) in the hdm2 - P2 promoter, minor variations in Hdm2 expression have phenotypic consequences on radiation sensitivity and cancer predisposition.

Previously, we have shown that heat shock protein Hsp70 associates with protein kinase C ( PKC) via an interaction that is triggered by dephosphorylation at the turn phosphorylation motif.

Cdh1 is a coactivator of the anaphase - promoting complex / cyclosome ( APC / C) and contributes to mitotic exit and G1 maintenance by facilitating the polyubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis of specific substrates.

Although both proteins bind the kappaB - motif, they produce opposite physiological consequences; NFkappaB activates transcription, promotes cell growth and is often found to be constitutively expressed in cancer cells, while ZAS3 generally represses transcription, inhibits cell proliferation and is downregulated in some cancers.
