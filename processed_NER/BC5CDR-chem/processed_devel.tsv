22 - oxacalcitriol suppresses secondary hyperparathyroidism without inducing low bone turnover in dogs with renal failure.	"22 - oxacalcitriol	0	18	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""22 - oxacalcitriol"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
BACKGROUND: Calcitriol therapy suppresses serum levels of parathyroid hormone ( PTH) in patients with renal failure but has several drawbacks, including hypercalcemia and / or marked suppression of bone turnover, which may lead to adynamic bone disease.	"Calcitriol	12	22	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Calcitriol"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
A new vitamin D analogue, 22 - oxacalcitriol ( OCT), has been shown to have promising characteristics.

This study was undertaken to determine the effects of OCT on serum PTH levels and bone turnover in states of normal or impaired renal function.	"OCT	54	57	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""OCT"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METHODS: Sixty dogs were either nephrectomized ( Nx, N = 38) or sham - operated ( Sham, N = 22).	[]
The animals received supplemental phosphate to enhance PTH secretion.	"phosphate	34	43	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""phosphate"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Fourteen weeks after the start of phosphate supplementation, half of the Nx and Sham dogs received doses of OCT ( three times per week); the other half were given vehicle for 60 weeks.

Thereafter, the treatment modalities for a subset of animals were crossed over for an additional eight months.	[]
Biochemical and hormonal indices of calcium and bone metabolism were measured throughout the study, and bone biopsies were done at baseline, 60 weeks after OCT or vehicle treatment, and at the end of the crossover period.

RESULTS: In Nx dogs, OCT significantly decreased serum PTH levels soon after the induction of renal insufficiency.	"OCT	21	24	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""OCT"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In long - standing secondary hyperparathyroidism, OCT ( 0. 03 microg / kg) stabilized serum PTH levels during the first months.	"OCT	50	53	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""OCT"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Serum PTH levels rose thereafter, but the rise was less pronounced compared with baseline than the rise seen in Nx control.	[]
These effects were accompanied by episodes of hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia.	[]
In animals with normal renal function, OCT induced a transient decrease in serum PTH levels at a dose of 0. 1 microg / kg, which was not sustained with lowering of the doses.	"OCT	39	42	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""OCT"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In Nx dogs, OCT reversed abnormal bone formation, such as woven osteoid and fibrosis, but did not significantly alter the level of bone turnover.	"OCT	12	15	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""OCT"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In addition, OCT improved mineralization lag time, ( that is, the rate at which osteoid mineralizes) in both Nx and Sham dogs.	"OCT	13	16	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""OCT"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that even though OCT does not completely prevent the occurrence of hypercalcemia in experimental dogs with renal insufficiency, it may be of use in the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism because it does not induce low bone turnover and, therefore, does not increase the risk of adynamic bone disease.

Hypotension, bradycardia, and asystole after high - dose intravenous methylprednisolone in a monitored patient.	"methylprednisolone	69	87	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""methylprednisolone"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We report a case of hypotension, bradycardia, and asystole after intravenous administration of high - dose methylprednisolone in a 73 - year - old patient who underwent electrocardiographic ( ECG) monitoring throughout the episode.	"methylprednisolone	107	125	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""methylprednisolone"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
There was a history of ischemic cardiac disease 9 years earlier.	[]
The patient was admitted with a pulmonary - renal syndrome with hemoptysis, rapidly progressive renal failure, and hypoxemia that required mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit.	[]
After receiving advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the patient recovered cardiac rhythm.	[]
The ECG showed a junctional rhythm without ventricular arrhythmia.	[]
This study reviews the current proposed mechanisms of sudden death after a high dose of intravenous methylprednisolone ( IVMP).	"methylprednisolone	100	118	Chemical/Drug"	"IVMP	121	125	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""methylprednisolone"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""IVMP"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
These mechanisms are not well understood because, in most cases, the patients were not monitored at the moment of the event.	[]
Rapid infusion and underlying cardiac disease were important risk factors in the case reported here, and the authors discount ventricular arrhythmia as the main mechanism.	[]
Worsening of levodopa - induced dyskinesias by motor and mental tasks.	"levodopa	13	21	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""levodopa"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Ten patients who had Parkinson ' s disease with disabling dyskinesia were included in this study to evaluate the role of mental ( mental calculation) and motor ( flexion / extension of right fingers, flexion / extension of left fingers, flexion / extension of the neck, speaking aloud) tasks on the worsening of peak - dose dyskinesia following administration of an effective single dose of apomorphine.	"apomorphine	391	402	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""apomorphine"", ""start_span"": 391, ""end_span"": 402, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Compared with the score at rest ( 1. 3 + / - 0. 3), a significant aggravation of the dyskinesia score was observed during speaking aloud ( 5. 2 + / - 1. 1, p < 0. 05), movements of right ( 4. 5 + / - 1. 0, p < 0. 05) and left ( 3. 7 + / - 0. 8, p < 0. 05) fingers, movements of the neck ( 5. 1 + / - 1. 0, p < 0. 05), and mental calculation ( 3. 1 + / - 1. 0, p < 0. 05).

"These results suggest that activation tasks such as "" speaking aloud "" could be used for objective assessment of dyskinesia severity."	[]
Urine N - acetyl - beta - D - glucosaminidase - - a marker of tubular damage?	[]
BACKGROUND: Although an indicator of renal tubular dysfunction, an increased urinary N - acetyl - beta - D - glucosaminidase ( NAG) activity might reflect increased lysosomal activity in renal tubular cells.	[]
METHODS: Puromycin aminonucleoside ( PAN) was administered to Sprague Dawley rats to induce proteinuria.	"Puromycin aminonucleoside	9	34	Chemical/Drug"	"PAN	37	40	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Puromycin aminonucleoside"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""PAN"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Total protein, albumin, NAG activity and protein electrophoretic pattern were assessed in daily urine samples for 33 days.	[]
The morphological appearance of the kidneys was examined on days three, four, six, eight and thirty three and the NAG isoenzyme patterns on days zero, four, eight and thirty three.	[]
RESULTS: Following intravenous PAN urine volume and urine NAG activity increased significantly by day two, but returned to normal by day four.	"PAN	31	34	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""PAN"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
After day four all treated animals exhibited a marked rise in urine albumin, total protein excretion and NAG activity.	[]
Electrophoresis showed a generalised increase in middle and high molecular weight urine proteins from day four onwards.	[]
Protein droplets first appeared prominent in tubular cells on day four.	[]
Peak urine NAG activity and a change in NAG isoenzyme pattern coincided with both the peak proteinuria and the reduction in intracellular protein and NAG droplets ( day six onwards).	[]
CONCLUSIONS: This animal model demonstrates that an increase in lysosomal turnover and hence urine NAG activity, occurs when increased protein is presented to the tubular cells.	[]
Urine NAG activity is thus a measure of altered function in the renal tubules and not simply an indicator of damage.	[]
Cauda equina syndrome after spinal anaesthesia with hyperbaric 5% lignocaine: a review of six cases of cauda equina syndrome reported to the Swedish Pharmaceutical Insurance 1993 - 1997.	"lignocaine	66	76	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""lignocaine"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Six cases of cauda equina syndrome with varying severity were reported to the Swedish Pharmaceutical Insurance during the period 1993 - 1997.	[]
All were associated with spinal anaesthesia using hyperbaric 5% lignocaine.	"lignocaine	64	74	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""lignocaine"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Five cases had single - shot spinal anaesthesia and one had a repeat spinal anaesthetic due to inadequate block.	[]
The dose of hyperbaric 5% lignocaine administered ranged from 60 to 120 mg.	"lignocaine	26	36	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""lignocaine"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Three of the cases were most likely caused by direct neurotoxicity of hyperbaric 5% lignocaine.	"lignocaine	84	94	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""lignocaine"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In the other 3 cases, direct neurotoxicity was also probable, but unfortunately radiological investigations were not done to definitely exclude a compressive aetiology.	[]
All cases sustained permanent neurological deficits.	[]
We recommend that hyperbaric lignocaine should be administered in concentrations not greater than 2% and at a total dose preferably not exceeding 60 mg.	"lignocaine	29	39	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""lignocaine"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

BACKGROUND: Sirolimus ( formerly rapamycin) is an immunosuppressive agent that interferes with T - cell activation.	"Sirolimus	12	21	Chemical/Drug"	"rapamycin	33	42	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Sirolimus"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""rapamycin"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
After 2 individuals with psoriasis developed a capillary leak syndrome following treatment with oral sirolimus lesional skin cells and activated peripheral blood cells were analyzed for induction of apoptosis.	"sirolimus	101	110	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sirolimus"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
OBSERVATIONS: A keratome skin specimen from 1 patient with sirolimus - induced capillary leak syndrome had a 2. 3 - fold increase in percentage of apoptotic cells ( to 48%) compared with an unaffected sirolimus - treated patient with psoriasis ( 21%).	"sirolimus	59	68	Chemical/Drug"	"sirolimus	59	68	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sirolimus"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""sirolimus"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Activated peripheral blood T cells from patients with psoriasis tended to exhibit greater spontaneous or dexamethasone - induced apoptosis than did normal T cells, particularly in the presence of sirolimus.	"dexamethasone	105	118	Chemical/Drug"	"sirolimus	196	205	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dexamethasone"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""sirolimus"", ""start_span"": 196, ""end_span"": 205, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
CONCLUSIONS: Severe adverse effects of sirolimus include fever, anemia, and capillary leak syndrome.	"sirolimus	39	48	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sirolimus"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
These symptoms may be the result of drug - induced apoptosis of lesional leukocytes, especially activated T lymphocytes, and possibly release of inflammatory mediators.	[]
Because patients with severe psoriasis may develop capillary leak from various systemic therapies, clinical monitoring is advisable for patients with inflammatory diseases who are treated with immune modulators.	[]
Effect of lithium maintenance therapy on thyroid and parathyroid function.	"lithium	10	17	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""lithium"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

RESULTS: Hypothyroidism developed in 40 patients, excluding 8 patients who were hypothyroid at baseline.	[]
All patients having first - degree relatives affected by thyroid illness had accelerated onset of hypothyroidism ( 3. 7 years after onset of lithium therapy) compared with patients without a family history ( 8. 6 years after onset of lithium therapy).

Women over 60 years of age were more often affected by hypothyroidism than women under 60 years of age ( 34. 6% versus 31. 9%).	[]
Magnesium levels in patients on lithium treatment were unchanged from baseline levels.

Migraine with aura and migraine without aura have the same pain phase, thus indicating that migraine with aura and migraine without aura share a common pathway of nociception.	[]
In recent years, increasing evidence has suggested that the messenger molecule nitric oxide ( NO) is involved in pain mechanisms of migraine without aura.	"nitric oxide	79	91	Chemical/Drug"	"NO	94	96	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""nitric oxide"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""NO"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In order to clarify whether the same is true for migraine with aura, in the present study we examined the headache response to intravenous infusion of glyceryl trinitrate ( GTN) ( 0. 5 microg / kg / min for 20 min) in 12 sufferers of migraine with aura.	"glyceryl trinitrate	151	170	Chemical/Drug"	"GTN	173	176	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""glyceryl trinitrate"", ""start_span"": 151, ""end_span"": 170, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""GTN"", ""start_span"": 173, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The specific aim was to elucidate whether an aura and / or an attack of migraine without aura could be induced.	[]
Fourteen healthy subjects served as controls.	[]
Aura symptoms were not elicited in any subject.	[]
Headache was more severe in migraineurs than in the controls during and immediately after GTN infusion ( p = 0. 037) as well as during the following 11 h ( p = 0. 008).	"GTN	90	93	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""GTN"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In the controls, the GTN - induced headache gradually disappeared, whereas in migraineurs peak headache intensity occurred at a mean time of 240 min post - infusion.	"GTN	21	24	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""GTN"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
At this time the induced headache in 6 of 12 migraineurs fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for migraine without aura of the International Headache Society.	[]
The results therefore suggest that NO is involved in the pain mechanisms of migraine with aura.	"NO	35	37	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""NO"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

RESULTS: Patients randomly assigned to enalapril had a 33% greater likelihood of decreased renal function than controls ( P =. 003).	"enalapril	39	48	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""enalapril"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
By multivariate analysis, in both the placebo and enalapril groups older age, diuretic therapy, and diabetes were associated with decreased renal function, whereas beta - blocker therapy and higher ejection fraction were renoprotective.

Ocular manifestations of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.	[]
We followed 210 cases of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis closely for eleven years.	[]
Thirty - six of the 210 patients ( 17. 2%) developed iridocyclitis.	[]
Iridocyclitis was seen most frequently in young female patients ( 0 to 4 years) with the monoarticular or pauciatricular form of the arthritis.	[]

Although 61% of patients had a noncontributory ocular history on entry, 42% had active uveitis on entry.	[]
Our approach was effective in detecting uveitis in new cases and exacerbations of uveitis in established cases.	[]
Forty - four percent of patients with uveitis had one or more identifiable signs or symptoms, such as red eye, ocular pain, decreased visual acuity, or photophobia, in order of decreasing frequency.	[]

Large doses of glucocorticoids can alter muscle physiology and susceptibility to neuromuscular blocking drugs by mechanisms not clearly understood.	[]
We investigated the effects of moderate and large doses of prednisolone on muscle function and pharmacology, and their relationship to changes in muscle size and acetylcholine receptor ( AChR) expression.

A fourth group of rats was pair fed ( food restricted) with the P100 rats for 7 days ( FR group).	[]
On Day 8, the nerve - evoked peak twitch tensions, tetanic tensions, and fatigability, and the dose - response curves of d - tubocurarine in the tibialis cranialis muscle were measured in vivo and related to muscle mass or expression of AChRs.

Rate of body weight gain was depressed in the P100, FR, and P10 groups compared with the S group.	[]
Tibialis muscle mass was smaller in the P100 group than in the P10 or S groups.	[]
The evoked peak twitch and tetanic tensions were less in the P100 group than in the P10 or S groups, however, tension per milligram of muscle mass was greater in the P100 group than in the S group.	[]
The 50% effective dose of d - tubocurarine ( microg / kg) in the tibialis muscle was smaller in the P10 ( 33. 6 + / - 5. 4) than in the S ( 61. 9 + / - 5. 0) or the P100 ( 71. 3 + / - 9. 6) groups.

While powerful antiparkinsonian effects had been observed as early as 1951, the potential of treating fluctuating Parkinson ' s disease by subcutaneous administration of apomorphine has only recently become the subject of systematic study.

A number of small scale clinical trials have unequivocally shown that intermittent subcutaneous apomorphine injections produce antiparkinsonian benefit close if not identical to that seen with levodopa and that apomorphine rescue injections can reliably revert off - periods even in patients with complex on - off motor swings.

The dosage of methylprednisolone recommended by the NASCIS 3 is the highest dose of steroids ever being used during a 2 - day period for any clinical condition.

We hypothesize that it may cause some damage to the muscle of spinal cord injury patients.	[]
Further, steroid myopathy recovers naturally and the neurological improvement shown in the NASCIS may be just a recording of this natural motor recovery from the steroid myopathy, instead of any protection that methylprednisolone offers to the spinal cord injury.

METHODS: The central and peripheral fields were examined with the Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer.	[]
Full visual electrophysiology, including flash electroretinography ( ERG), pattern electroretinography, multifocal ERG using the VERIS system, electro - oculography, and flash and pattern visual evoked potentials, was undertaken.	[]
RESULTS: Seven patients showed marked visual field constriction with some sparing of the temporal visual field.	[]
The eighth exhibited concentric constriction.	[]
Most electrophysiological responses were usually just within normal limits; two patients had subnormal Arden electro - oculography indices; and one patient showed an abnormally delayed photopic b wave.	[]
However, five patients showed delayed 30 - Hz flicker b waves, and seven patients showed delayed oscillatory potentials.	[]
Multifocal ERG showed abnormalities that sometimes correlated with the visual field appearance and confirmed that the deficit occurs at the retinal level.	[]
CONCLUSION: Marked visual field constriction appears to be associated with vigabatrin therapy.	"vigabatrin	75	85	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""vigabatrin"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Until now, the test has been focused only on the organic lesion in the coronary artery, and positive DSE has indicated the presence of significant fixed coronary artery stenosis.	[]
The aim of the present study is to examine whether myocardial ischemia due to coronary spasm is induced by dobutamine.	"dobutamine	107	117	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dobutamine"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We performed DSE on 51 patients with coronary spastic angina but without significant fixed coronary artery stenosis.	[]
All patients had anginal attacks at rest with ST elevation on the electrocardiogram ( variant angina).	[]
Coronary spasm was induced by intracoronary injection of acetylcholine, and no fixed coronary artery stenosis was documented on angiograms in all patients.	"acetylcholine	57	70	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""acetylcholine"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
DSE was performed with intravenous dobutamine infusion with an incremental doses of 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 microg / kg / min every 5 minutes.	"dobutamine	35	45	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dobutamine"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Of the 51 patients, 7 patients showed asynergy with ST elevation.	[]
All 7 patients ( 13. 7%) had chest pain during asynergy, and both chest pain and electrocardiographic changes were preceded by asynergy.	[]
These findings indicate that dobutamine can provoke coronary spasm in some patients with coronary spastic angina.	"dobutamine	29	39	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dobutamine"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Evidence of functional somatotopy in GPi from results of pallidotomy.	[]
The objective of this study was to explore the functional anatomy of the globus pallidus internus ( GPi) by studying the effects of unilateral pallidotomy on parkinsonian ' off ' signs and levodopa - induced dyskinesias ( LID).	"levodopa	189	197	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""levodopa"", ""start_span"": 189, ""end_span"": 197, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We found significant positive correlations between the preoperative levodopa responsiveness of motor signs and the levodopa responsiveness of scores in timed tests ( Core Assessment Program for Intracerebral Transplantations) in the contralateral limbs and the improvement in these scores after surgery, whereas there was no correlation with the improvement in LID.	"levodopa	68	76	Chemical/Drug"	"levodopa	68	76	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""levodopa"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""levodopa"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We also found a highly significant correlation ( P: < 0. 0001, r = 0. 8) between the volume of the ventral lesion in the GPi and the improvement in LID in the contralateral limbs, whereas there was no correlation between the ventral volume and the improvement in parkinsonian ' off ' signs.	[]
The volumes of the total lesion cylinder and the dorsal lesion did not correlate with the outcome of either dyskinesias or parkinsonian ' off ' signs.	[]
The differential predictive value of levodopa responsiveness for the outcome of parkinsonian ' off ' signs and LID and the different correlations of ventral lesion volume with dyskinesias and parkinsonian ' off ' signs indicate that different anatomical or pathophysiological substrates may be responsible for the generation of parkinsonian ' off ' signs and dyskinesias.	"levodopa	37	45	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""levodopa"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Whereas cells in a wider area of the GPi may be implicated in parkinsonism, the ventral GPi seems to be crucial for the manifestation of LID.	[]
We suggest that our observations are additional proof of the functional somatotopy of the systems within the GPi that mediate parkinsonism and dyskinesias, especially along the dorsoventral trajectory used in pallidotomy.	[]
The outcome of pallidotomy in which the lesion involves the ventral and dorsal GPi could be the net effect of alteration in the activity of pathways which mediate different symptoms, and hence could be variable.	[]

Patient demographics, history of underlying drug or alcohol - related seizure disorder, estimated time from seizure to sample collection, history or suspicion of cocaine or amphetamine abuse, results of clinical urine testing for drugs of abuse, and assay results were recorded without patient identifiers.	"alcohol	52	59	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""alcohol"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
RESULTS: Fourteen of 248 ( 5. 6%, 95% CI 2. 7% - 8. 5%) plasma samples were positive by immunoassay testing for benzoylecgonine and no samples ( 0%, 95% CI 0 - 1. 2%) were positive for amphetamine.

Positive test results were more common in patient visits where there was a history or suspicion of cocaine or amphetamine abuse ( p < 0. 0005).	[]
CONCLUSIONS: During this study period, routine plasma screening for cocaine and amphetamines in adult seizure patients had a low yield.	"cocaine	68	75	Chemical/Drug"	"amphetamines	80	92	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cocaine"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""amphetamines"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
As a result, routine plasma screening would yield few cases of stimulant drug in which there was neither a history nor suspicion of drug abuse in this population.	[]

BACKGROUND: In recent studies increased amounts of nitric oxide ( NO) and apoptosis have been implicated in various pathological conditions in the kidney.	"nitric oxide	51	63	Chemical/Drug"	"NO	66	68	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""nitric oxide"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""NO"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We have studied the role of NO and its association with apoptosis in an experimental model of nephrotic syndrome induced by a single injection of adriamycin ( ADR).	"NO	28	30	Chemical/Drug"	"adriamycin	146	156	Chemical/Drug"	"ADR	159	162	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""NO"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""adriamycin"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""ADR"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 162, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METHODS: The alteration in the NO pathway was assessed by measuring nitrite levels in serum / urine and by evaluating the changes in vascular reactivity of the isolated perfused rat kidney ( IPRK) system.	"NO	31	33	Chemical/Drug"	"nitrite	68	75	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""NO"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""nitrite"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Rats were stratified into control groups and ADR - induced nephropathy groups.	"ADR	45	48	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ADR"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
These two groups were then divided into: group 1, animals receiving saline; and group 2, animals receiving aminoguanidine ( AG) which is a specific inhibitor of inducible - NO synthase.

On day 21, rats were sacrificed after obtaining material for biochemical analysis.	[]
RESULTS: Histopathological examination of the kidneys of rats treated with ADR revealed focal areas of mesangial proliferation and mild tubulointerstitial inflammation.	"ADR	75	78	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ADR"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
They also had significantly higher levels of proteinuria compared with control and treatment groups ( P < 0. 05).	[]
Urine nitrite levels were significantly increased in the ADR - nephropathy group ( P < 0. 05).

In the IPRK phenylephrine and acetylcholine related responses were significantly impaired in the ADR - nephropathy group.

Apoptosis was not detected in controls.	[]
However, in the ADR - nephropathy group, numerous apoptotic cells were identified in the tubulointerstitial areas.	"ADR	16	19	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ADR"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Double staining revealed numerous interstitial apoptotic cells to stain for ED1, a marker for monocytes / macrophages.	[]
Treatment with AG prevented the impairment of renal vascular bed responses and reduced both urine nitrite levels and apoptosis to control levels.

Dual effects of melatonin on barbiturate - induced narcosis in rats.

Melatonin affects the circadian sleep / wake cycle, but it is not clear whether it may influence drug - induced narcosis.	"Melatonin	0	9	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Melatonin"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Sodium thiopenthal was administered intraperitoneally into male rats pre - treated with melatonin ( 0. 05, 0. 5, 5 and 50 mg / kg).	"Sodium thiopenthal	0	18	Chemical/Drug"	"melatonin	88	97	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Sodium thiopenthal"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""melatonin"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Melatonin pre - treatment affected in a dual manner barbiturate narcosis, however, no dose - effect correlation was found.	"Melatonin	0	9	Chemical/Drug"	"barbiturate	52	63	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Melatonin"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""barbiturate"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In particular, low doses reduced the latency to and prolonged the duration of barbiturate narcosis.	"barbiturate	78	89	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""barbiturate"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In contrast, the highest dose of melatonin ( 50 mg / kg) caused a paradoxical increase in the latency and produced a sustained reduction of the duration of narcosis, and a reduction in mortality rate.	"melatonin	33	42	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""melatonin"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Melatonin 0. 5 and 5 mg / kg influenced the duration but not the latency of ketamine - or diazepam - induced narcosis.	"Melatonin	0	9	Chemical/Drug"	"ketamine	76	84	Chemical/Drug"	"diazepam	90	98	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Melatonin"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""ketamine"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""diazepam"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Thus, the dual action of melatonin on pharmacological narcosis seems to be specific for the barbiturate mechanism of action.

Cardiotoxicity was defined by reductions in left - ventricular ejection fraction, assessed by serial multigated radionuclide angiography scans, or congestive heart failure ( CHF).	[]
Antitumor efficacy was assessed by objective tumor response rates ( World Health Organization criteria), time to progression, and survival.	[]
RESULTS: Six percent of MC patients versus 21% ( including five cases of CHF) of AC patients developed cardiotoxicity ( P =. 0002).	[]
Median cumulative doxorubicin dose at onset was more than 2, 220 mg / m ( 2) for MC versus 480 mg / m ( 2) for AC ( P =. 0001, hazard ratio, 5. 04).	"doxorubicin	18	29	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""doxorubicin"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
MC patients also experienced less grade 4 neutropenia.	[]
Antitumor efficacy of MC versus AC was comparable: objective response rates, 43% versus 43%; median time to progression, 5. 1% versus 5. 5 months; median time to treatment failure, 4. 6 versus 4. 4 months; and median survival, 19 versus 16 months.	[]
CONCLUSION: Myocet improves the therapeutic index of doxorubicin by significantly reducing cardiotoxicity and grade 4 neutropenia and provides comparable antitumor efficacy, when used in combination with cyclophosphamide as first - line therapy for MBC.

BACKGROUND: Atrial tachycardia - induced remodeling promotes the occurrence and maintenance of atrial fibrillation ( AF) and decreases L - type Ca ( 2 +) current.	"Ca	144	146	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Ca"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
There is also a clinical suggestion that acute L - type Ca ( 2) channel blockade can promote AF, consistent with an AF promoting effect of Ca ( 2 +) channel inhibition.

METHODS: To evaluate the potential mechanisms of AF promotion by Ca ( 2 +) channel blockers, we administered verapamil to morphine - chloralose anesthetized dogs.

Epicardial mapping with 240 epicardial electrodes was used to evaluate activation during AF.	[]
RESULTS: Verapamil caused AF promotion in six dogs, increasing mean duration of AF induced by burst pacing, from 8 + / - 4 s ( mean + / - S. E.) to 95 + / - 39 s ( P < 0. 01 vs. control) at a loading dose of 0. 1 mg / kg and 228 + / - 101 s ( P < 0. 0005 vs. control) at a dose of 0. 2 mg / kg.	"Verapamil	9	18	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Verapamil"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Underlying electrophysiological mechanisms were studied in detail in five additional dogs under control conditions and in the presence of the higher dose of verapamil.	"verapamil	157	166	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""verapamil"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 166, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In these experiments, verapamil shortened mean effective refractory period ( ERP) from 122 + / - 5 to 114 + / - 4 ms ( P < 0. 02) at a cycle length of 300 ms, decreased ERP heterogeneity ( from 15 + / - 1 to 10 + / - 1%, P < 0. 05), heterogeneously accelerated atrial conduction and decreased the cycle length of AF ( 94 + / - 4 to 84 + / - 3 ms, P < 0. 005).	"verapamil	22	31	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""verapamil"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Diltiazem did not affect ERP, AF cycle length or AF duration, but produced conduction acceleration similar to that caused by verapamil ( n = 5).

In the presence of autonomic blockade, verapamil failed to promote AF and increased, rather than decreasing, refractoriness.	"verapamil	39	48	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""verapamil"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Neither verapamil nor diltiazem affected atrial conduction in the presence of autonomic blockade.

Epicardial mapping suggested that verapamil promoted AF by increasing the number of simultaneous wavefronts reflected by separate zones of reactivation in each cycle.	"verapamil	34	43	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""verapamil"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
CONCLUSIONS: Verapamil promotes AF in normal dogs by promoting multiple circuit reentry, an effect dependent on intact autonomic tone and not shared by diltiazem.

CASE SUMMARY: A 68 - year - old white woman with Candida glabrata isolated from a presacral abscess developed TDP eight days after commencing oral fluconazole The patient had no other risk factors for TDP, including coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, and electrolyte abnormalities There was a temporal association between the initiation of fluconazole and TDP.

The cumulative doses of levobupivacaine that produced dysrhythmias and asystole were smaller than the corresponding doses of ropivacaine, but they were larger than those of bupivacaine.

The number of successful resuscitations did not differ among groups.	[]
However, a smaller dose of epinephrine was required in the Ropivacaine group than in the other groups.

Although these drugs are highly effective and represent the mainstay of transplant immunosuppression, they are associated with acute and chronic nephrotoxicity.	[]
Acute nephrotoxicity, which occurs in the early period after transplantation, leads to a higher rate of dialysis, and chronic nephrotoxicity may eventually result in graft loss.	[]
Acute and chronic nephrotoxicity is becoming more common as the use of marginal kidneys for transplantation increases.	[]
Two recently available immunosuppressive agents, mycophenolate mofetil and sirolimus ( rapamycin), have no nephrotoxicity.

Furthermore, 18. 28% of patients with a history of chronic urticaria and 11. 8% of subjects with an history of NSAID - induced urticaria / angioedema or angioedema alone ( with or without chronic urticaria) resulted to be intolerant to alternative drugs.

On the 13th day of each period, heart rate was recorded continuously during a typical, ambulant 24 - hour period.	[]
RESULTS: Both timolol solution and timolol gellan reduced the mean 24 - hour heart rate compared with placebo ( P < or =. 001), and this reduction was most pronounced during the daytime ( - 7. 5% change in mean heart rate, - 5. 7 beats / min).

Combination therapy is associated with a clinically important adverse effect: ribavirin - induced hemolytic anemia ( RIHA).	"ribavirin	78	87	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ribavirin"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The objective of this study was to evaluate the direct health - care costs and management of RIHA during treatment of CHC in a clinical trial setting.	[]
METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to synthesize information on the incidence and management of RIHA.	[]
Decision - analytic techniques were used to estimate the cost of treating RIHA.	[]
Uncertainty was evaluated using sensitivity analyses.	[]
RESULTS: RIHA, defined as a reduction in hemoglobin to less than 100 g / L, occurs in approximately 7% to 9% of patients treated with combination therapy.	[]
The standard of care for management of RIHA is reduction or discontinuation of the ribavirin dosage.	"ribavirin	83	92	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ribavirin"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We estimated the direct cost of treating clinically significant RIHA to be 170 per patient receiving combination therapy per 48 - week treatment course ( range 68 - 692).	[]
The results of the one - way sensitivity analyses ranged from 57 to 317.	[]
In comparison, the cost of 48 weeks of combination therapy is 16, 459.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: The direct cost of treating clinically significant RIHA is 1% ( 170 / 16, 459) of drug treatment costs.	[]
Questions remain about the optimal dose of ribavirin and the incidence of RIHA in a real - world population.	"ribavirin	43	52	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ribavirin"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies of intrathecal adenosine suggest it may be effective in the treatment of acute and chronic pain in humans, and preliminary studies in volunteers and patients with a Swedish formulation of adenosine suggests it may be effective in hypersensitivity states but not with acute noxious stimulation.

METHODS: Following Food and Drug Administration and institutional review board approval and written informed consent, 65 volunteers were studied in two trials: an open - label, dose - escalating trial with intrathecal adenosine doses of 0. 25 - 2. 0 mg and a double - blind, placebo - controlled trial of adenosine, 2 mg.

In contrast, residence time of adenosine in cerebrospinal fluid was short ( < 4 h).	"adenosine	31	40	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""adenosine"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
CONCLUSIONS: These results show selective inhibition by intrathecal adenosine of hypersensitivity, presumed to reflect central sensitization in humans after peripheral capsaicin injection.

Thromboemboli were venous ( 12 patients, 7 with pulmonary emboli) or arterial ( 4 patients) or both.	[]
Platelet counts were mildly decreased in all but 2 patients on second presentation.	[]
On readmission, 11 patients received therapeutic heparin, which worsened the patients ' clinical condition and, in all 11 cases, decreased the platelet count ( mean at readmission, 143 x 10 ( 9) cells / L; mean nadir after heparin re - exposure, 39 x 10 ( 9) cells / L).

Chronically elevated prolactin levels in children with prolactinomas may be associated with arrested growth and development resulting in either delayed puberty or short stature.	[]
These possibilities stress the importance of developing a safe and effective approach to drug - induced hyperprolactinemia in youth.	[]
We report the successful treatment of risperidone - induced hyperprolactinemia with cabergoline in youth.

When serum prolactin levels normalized in all four subjects ( mean 11. 2 + / - 10. 9 ng / mL), the cabergoline dose was reduced to 1 mg / week in three of four subjects.

CASE SUMMARY: A 70 - year - old healthy woman from Iraq developed acute cholestatic hepatitis 3 weeks following repair of the right rotator cuff under general anesthesia.	[]
There was no evidence for viral, autoimmune, or metabolic causes of hepatitis.	[]

There is a growing list of drugs implicated in acquired long QT syndrome and torsade de pointes.	[]
However, the torsadogenic potential of metoclopramide, a commonly used antiemetic and prokinetic drug, has not been reported in the literature, despite its chemical similarity to procainamide.

We report on a 92 - year - old woman with preexisting complete left bundle branch block who developed torsade de pointes after intravenous and oral administration of metoclopramide.	"metoclopramide	166	180	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""metoclopramide"", ""start_span"": 166, ""end_span"": 180, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Excitotoxicity leading to neuronal cell death in the affected areas is a major consequence of seizures at the cellular level.	[]
In this respect, little is known about the role of DA receptors in the occurrence of epilepsy - induced neuronal cell death.	"DA	51	53	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""DA"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Here we analyze the occurrence of seizures and neurotoxicity in D2R - / - mice treated with the cholinergic agonist pilocarpine.	"pilocarpine	116	127	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""pilocarpine"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We compared these results with those previously obtained with kainic acid ( KA), a potent glutamate agonist.	"kainic acid	62	73	Chemical/Drug"	"KA	76	78	Chemical/Drug"	"glutamate	90	99	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""kainic acid"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""KA"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""glutamate"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Importantly, D2R - / - mice develop seizures at doses of both drugs that are not epileptogenic for WT littermates and show greater neurotoxicity.	[]
However, pilocarpine - induced seizures result in a more widespread neuronal death in both WT and D2R - / - brains in comparison to KA.	"pilocarpine	9	20	Chemical/Drug"	"KA	132	134	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""pilocarpine"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""KA"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Thus, the absence of D2R lowers the threshold for seizures induced by both glutamate and acetylcholine.	"glutamate	75	84	Chemical/Drug"	"acetylcholine	89	102	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""glutamate"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""acetylcholine"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Moreover, the dopaminergic control of epilepsy - induced neurodegeneration seems to be mediated by distinct interactions of D2R signaling with these two neurotransmitters.	[]

Pregnenolone sulphate ( PREGS) has generated interest as one of the most potent memory - enhancing neurosteroids to be examined in rodent learning studies, with particular importance in the ageing process.

The mechanism by which this endogenous steroid enhances memory formation is hypothesized to involve actions on glutamatergic and GABAergic systems.	"steroid	39	46	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""steroid"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
This hypothesis stems from findings that PREGS is a potent positive modulator of N - methyl - d - aspartate receptors ( NMDARs) and a negative modulator of gamma - aminobutyric acid ( A) receptors ( GABA ( A) Rs).	"PREGS	41	46	Chemical/Drug"	"N - methyl - d - aspartate	81	107	Chemical/Drug"	"gamma - aminobutyric acid	156	181	Chemical/Drug"	"GABA	199	203	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""PREGS"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""N - methyl - d - aspartate"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""gamma - aminobutyric acid"", ""start_span"": 156, ""end_span"": 181, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""GABA"", ""start_span"": 199, ""end_span"": 203, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Moreover, PREGS is able to reverse the amnesic - like effects of NMDAR and GABA ( A) R ligands.

To investigate this hypothesis, the present study in rats examined the memory - altering abilities of structural analogs of PREGS, which differ in their modulation of NMDAR and / or GABA ( A) R function.	"PREGS	124	129	Chemical/Drug"	"GABA	182	186	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""PREGS"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""GABA"", ""start_span"": 182, ""end_span"": 186, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The analogs tested were: 11 - ketopregnenolone sulphate ( an agent that is inactive at GABA ( A) Rs and NMDARs), epipregnanolone ( [ 3beta - hydroxy - 5beta - pregnan - 20 - one] sulphate, an inhibitor of both GABA ( A) Rs and NMDARs), and a newly synthesized ( -) PREGS enantiomer ( which is identical to PREGS in effects on GABA ( A) Rs and NMDARs).

The memory - enhancing effects of PREGS and its analogs were tested in the passive avoidance task using the model of scopolamine - induced amnesia.	"PREGS	34	39	Chemical/Drug"	"scopolamine	117	128	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""PREGS"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""scopolamine"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Both PREGS and its ( -) enantiomer blocked the effects of scopolamine.

The results show that, unlike PREGS, 11 - ketopregnenolone sulphate and epipregnanolone sulphate failed to block the effect of scopolamine, suggesting that altering the modulation of NMDA receptors diminishes the memory - enhancing effects of PREGS.

Moreover, enantioselectivity was demonstrated by the ability of natural PREGS to be an order of magnitude more effective than its synthetic enantiomer in reversing scopolamine - induced amnesia.

Activation of the nuclear enzyme poly ( ADP - ribose) polymerase ( PARP) by oxidant - mediated DNA damage is an important pathway of cell dysfunction and tissue injury in conditions associated with oxidative stress.	[]
Increased oxidative stress is a major factor implicated in the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin ( DOX), a widely used antitumor anthracycline antibiotic.

Using a dual approach of PARP - 1 suppression, by genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition with the phenanthridinone PARP inhibitor PJ34, we now demonstrate the role of PARP in the development of cardiac dysfunction induced by DOX.

An overshooting of peak grip force by 51% ( P < 0. 05) and of static grip force by 45% ( P < 0. 01) was observed in the ON - compared with the OFF - drug condition.	[]
In contrast, no excessive force was found in Parkinson ' s disease - LID.	[]
Peak grip force in ON - state was 140% ( P < 0. 05) higher in Parkinson ' s disease + LID than in Parkinson ' s disease - LID, while static grip force was increased by 138% ( P < 0. 01) between groups.	[]
Severity of peak - dose dyskinesias was strongly correlated with grip force in ON - state ( r = 0. 79 with peak force, P < 0. 01).	[]
No correlation was observed between forces and the motor score as well as with the daily dose of dopaminergic medication.	[]
Force excess was only observed in patients with LID and motor fluctuations.	[]
A close relationship was seen between the overshooting of forces and dyskinesias in the ON - drug condition.	[]

BACKGROUND: Adenovirus is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised host.	[]
The incidence of severe adenovirus disease in pediatrics is increasing in association with growing numbers of immunocompromised children, where case fatality rates as high as 50% to 80% have been reported.	[]
There are no approved antiviral agents with proven efficacy for the treatment of severe adenovirus disease, nor are there any prospective randomized, controlled trials of potentially useful anti - adenovirus therapies.	[]
Apparent clinical success in the treatment of severe adenovirus disease is limited to a few case reports and small series.	[]
Experience is greatest with intravenous ribavirin and cidofovir.

RESULTS: Complete clinical recovery followed later by viral clearance was observed in 2 children: the cardiac transplant recipient with adenovirus hemorrhagic cystitis and the immunocompetent neonate with adenovirus pneumonia.	[]
The remaining 3 children died of adenovirus disease.	[]
Intravenous ribavirin therapy was well tolerated.	"ribavirin	12	21	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ribavirin"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

DISCUSSION: Our series of patients is representative of the spectrum of immunocompromised children at greatest risk for severe adenovirus disease, namely solid - organ and bone marrow transplant recipients, neonates, and children with immunodeficiency.	[]
Although intravenous ribavirin was not effective for all children with severe adenovirus disease in this series or in the literature, therapy is unlikely to be of benefit if begun late in the course of the infection.	"ribavirin	21	30	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ribavirin"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Early identification, eg by polymerase chain reaction of those patients at risk of disseminated adenovirus disease may permit earlier antiviral treatment and better evaluation of therapeutic response.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: Two of 5 children with severe adenovirus disease treated with intravenous ribavirin recovered.	"ribavirin	87	96	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ribavirin"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The availability of newer rapid diagnostic techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction, may make earlier, more effective treatment of adenovirus infection possible.	[]
Given the seriousness and increasing prevalence of adenovirus disease in certain hosts, especially children, a large, multicenter clinical trial of potentially useful anti - adenoviral therapies, such as intravenous ribavirin, is clearly required to demonstrate the most effective and least toxic therapy.

He initially presented to hospital after six hours with mild hypotension and was treated with activated charcoal and intravenous fluids.	[]
Eighteen hours after the overdose he had two generalised tonic - clonic seizures.	[]
The patient remained unresponsive with junctional bradycardia, unrecordable blood pressure, and then became asystolic.	[]
He was resuscitated with high dose ( 13. 5 g) intravenous calcium and adrenaline ( epinephrine).

BACKGROUND: The interruption of oral anticoagulant ( OAC) administration is sometimes indicated in patients with mechanical heart valves, mainly before noncardiac surgery, non - surgical interventions, and pregnancy.	[]
Unfractionated heparin ( UH) is currently the substitute for selected patients.

HYPOTHESIS: The aim of the present study was to review the data accumulated so far on the use of LMWH in this patient population and to discuss its applicability in common practice.	"LMWH	97	101	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""LMWH"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METHODS: For this paper, the current medical literature on LMWH in patients with mechanical heart valves was extensively reviewed.	"LMWH	59	63	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""LMWH"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
RESULTS: There were eight series and six case reports.	[]
None of the studies was randomized, and only one was prospective.	[]
Data to establish the thromboembolic risk were incomplete.	[]
After excluding case reports, the following groups were constructed: ( a) short - term administration, after valve insertion ( n = 212); ( b) short - term, perioperative ( noncardiac) / periprocedural ( n = 114); ( c) long - term, due to intolerance to OAC ( n = 16); ( d) long - term, in pregnancy ( n = 10).	[]
The incidence rate of thromboembolism was 0. 9% for all the studies and 0. 5, 0, 20, and 0% in groups a, b, c, and d, respectively; for hemorrhage, the overall rate was 3. 4% ( 3. 8, 2. 6, 10, and 0% for the respective groups).	[]
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with mechanical heart valves, short - term LMWH therapy compares favorably with UH.

Arteritis induced in rats by vasodilators, fenoldopam and theophylline, was examined immunohistochemically for expressions of inducible type of nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS), basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF) and tumor growth factor - beta1 ( TGF - beta1).	"fenoldopam	43	53	Chemical/Drug"	"theophylline	58	70	Chemical/Drug"	"nitric oxide	144	156	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""fenoldopam"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""theophylline"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""nitric oxide"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Rats were administered fenoldopam for 24 hours by intravenous infusion with or without following repeated daily oral administrations of theophylline.

Irrespective of theophylline administration, iNOS antigens were remarkably abundant in ED - 1 - positive cells on day 5 and 8 post - fenoldopam - infusion ( DPI); bFGF antigens were remarkably abundant in ED - 1 - positive cells on 1 and 3 DPI; TGF - beta1 antigens were observed in ED - 1 - positive cells on and after 5 DPI.

These results suggest that the peak expression of iNOS antigen was followed by that of bFGF antigen, and bFGF may have a suppressive effect on iNOS expression in these rat arteritis models.	[]
On the other hand, TGF - beta1 was not considered to have a suppressive effect on iNOS expression in these models.	[]

Fifty - nine per cent of patients had had previous therapy with IL - 2 and 52% were performance status 2 or 3.	[]
Systemic plasma VEGF165 levels were measured by dual monoclonal ELISA in 8 patients.	[]
RESULTS: 24 patients were evaluable for response with one partial response of 11 months duration of a patient with hepatic and pulmonary metastases ( 4%), one minor response, and 2 patients stable for over 6 months.	[]
Somnolence and constipation were prominent toxicities and most patients could not tolerate the 1200 mg / day dose level.	[]

Following administration of these agents, the presence, and degree of fasciculation were assessed visually on a four point scale by one investigator who was blinded to the drug administered.	[]
The blood pressure and heart rate of each patient were monitored on nine occasions.	[]
Twenty - four hours later, any myalgia experienced was assessed according to a structured questionaire and graded by a four point scale by one investigator blinded to the intraoperative management.	[]
The results indicate that muscle fasciculation was not found in Group PR while the patients in Group LS had a lower incidence of muscle fasciculation than those in Group PS ( p < 0. 001).	[]
At 24 h, the incidence of myalgia was higher in Group PS than in Group LS and PR ( p < 0. 05).	[]
A correlation was not found between the incidence of myalgia and the occurrence of muscle fasciculation.	[]
The changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were not significant among the three groups.	[]

Nephrotoxic effects in high - risk patients undergoing angiography.	[]
BACKGROUND: The use of iodinated contrast medium can result in nephropathy.	[]
Whether iso - osmolar contrast medium is less nephrotoxic than low - osmolar contrast medium in high - risk patients is uncertain.	[]
METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double - blind, prospective, multicenter study comparing the nephrotoxic effects of an iso - osmolar, dimeric, nonionic contrast medium, iodixanol, with those of a low - osmolar, nonionic, monomeric contrast medium, iohexol.

The pathogenesis of this myalgia is still unclear; inflammation has been suggested but without convincing evidence.	[]
We designed the present study to investigate whether an inflammatory reaction contributes to this myalgia.	[]
The incidence and severity of succinylcholine - associated myalgia was determined in 64 patients pretreated with saline or dexamethasone before succinylcholine ( n = 32 for each).	"succinylcholine	30	45	Chemical/Drug"	"dexamethasone	123	136	Chemical/Drug"	"succinylcholine	30	45	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""succinylcholine"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""dexamethasone"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""succinylcholine"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Incidence and severity of myalgia did not differ significantly between the two groups: 15 patients in the dexamethasone group complained of myalgia compared with 18 patients in the saline group, and severe myalgia was reported by five patients and three patients, respectively ( not significant).	"dexamethasone	106	119	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dexamethasone"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
At 48 h after surgery, 12 patients in both groups still suffered from myalgia ( not significant).	[]
In addition, interleukin - 6 ( IL - 6) as an early marker of inflammation was assessed in a subgroup of 10 patients pretreated with saline.	[]
We found an increase of IL - 6 for only three patients, but only one patient reported myalgia; no relationship between myalgia and the increase of IL - 6 was found.	[]
In conclusion, there is no evidence for an inflammatory origin of succinylcholine - associated myalgia.	"succinylcholine	66	81	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""succinylcholine"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
IMPLICATIONS: Administration of dexamethasone before succinylcholine was not effective in decreasing the incidence or the severity of succinylcholine - induced postoperative myalgia.

Oral administration of lindane ( 2. 5, 5, 10 and 15 mg / kg, body weight) for 5 days was found to produce a dose - dependent increase in the activity of P450 dependent 7 - ethoxyresorufin - O - deethylase ( EROD), 7 - pentoxyresorufin - O - dealkylase ( PROD) and N - nitrosodimethylamine demethylase ( NDMA - d) in rat brain and liver.

A significant increase in the hepatic and brain P450 monooxygenases was also observed when the duration of exposure of low dose ( 2. 5 mg / kg) of lindane was increased from 5 days to 15 or 21 days.	"lindane	147	154	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""lindane"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
As observed with different doses, the magnitude of induction in the activity of P450 monooxygenases was several fold higher in liver microsomes when compared with the brain.	[]
Western blotting studies have indicated that the increase in the P450 enzymes could be due to the increase in the expression of P450 1A1 / 1A2, 2B1 / 2B2 and 2E1 isoenzymes.	[]
In vitro studies using organic inhibitors specific for individual P450 isoenzymes and antibody inhibition experiments have further demonstrated that the increase in the activity of PROD, EROD and NDMA - d are due to the increase in the levels of P450 2B1 / 2B2, 1A1 / 1A2 and 2E1 isoenzymes, respectively.	"NDMA	196	200	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""NDMA"", ""start_span"": 196, ""end_span"": 200, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Induction studies have further shown that while pretreatment of 3 - methylcholanthrene ( MC), an inducer of P4501A1 / 1A2, did not produce any significant effect in the incidence of lindane induced convulsions, pretreatment with phenobarbital ( PB), an inducer of P450 2B1 / 2B2 or ethanol, an inducer of P450 2E1 catalysed reactions, significantly increased the incidence of lindane induced convulsions.

Similarly, when the P450 - mediated metabolism of lindane was blocked by cobalt chloride incidence of convulsions was increased in animals treated with lindane indicating that lindane per se or its metabolites formed by PB or ethanol inducible P450 isoenzymes are involved in its neurobehavioral toxicity.

BACKGROUND: Analysis of the literature for nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) suggests that a low incidence of developmental anomalies occurs in rats given NSAIDs on specific days during organogenesis.	[]
Aspirin ( acetylsalicylic acid [ ASA]), an irreversible cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 inhibitor, induces developmental anomalies when administered to Wistar rats on gestational day ( GD) 9, 10, or 11 ( Kimmel CA, Wilson JG, Schumacher HJ. Teratology 4: 15 - 24, 1971).

There are no published ASA studies using the multiple dosing paradigm of GDs 6 to 17.	"ASA	23	26	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ASA"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Objectives of the current study were to compare results between Sprague - Dawley ( SD) and Wistar strains when ASA is administered on GD 9, 10, or 11; to compare the malformation patterns following single and multiple dosings during organogenesis in SD rats; and to test the hypothesis that maternal gastrointestinal toxicity confounds the detection of low incidence malformations with ASA when a multiple dosing paradigm is used.

METHODS: ASA was administered as a single dose on GD 9 ( 0, 250, 500, or 625 mg / kg), 10 ( 0, 500, 625, or 750 mg / kg), or 11 ( 0, 500, 750, or 1000 mg / kg) and from GD 6 to GD 17 ( 0, 50, 125, or 250 mg / kg a day) in the multiple dose study to SD rats.

Animals were killed on GD 21, and fetuses were examined viscerally.	[]
RESULTS: The literature evaluation suggested that NSAIDs induce ventricular septal defects ( VSDs) and midline defects ( MDs) in rats and diaphragmatic hernia ( DH), MDs, and VSDs in rabbits ( Cook JC et al., 2003); hence, the present study focused on these malformations, even though ASA induces several other low - incidence malformations.	"ASA	285	288	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ASA"", ""start_span"": 285, ""end_span"": 288, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In single dose studies, DH, MD, and VSD were induced on GDs 9 and 10.	[]
VSD also was noted following treatment on GD 11.	[]
In contrast, DH and MD were noted in the multiple dose study design only in the high - dose group, and VSD was noted across all dose groups.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: High concordance in major developmental anomalies between Wistar and SD rats were noted with the exception of VSD in the SD rats and hydrocephalus in the Wistar rats.	[]
Variations and malformations were similar when ASA was administered as a single dose or during the period of organogenesis ( GDs 6 to 17).	"ASA	47	50	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ASA"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
It was also evident that, by titrating the dose to achieve a maximum tolerated dose, malformations that normally occur at low incidence, as reported from previous single dose studies, could also be induced with ASA given at multiple doses.

Significant increases in certain factors of the blood coagulation and fibrinolysin systems ( factors I, II, VII, VIII, IX, and X and plasminogen) were observed in the treated groups.	[]
Severe complications developed in four patients.	[]
"All four had an abnormal blood coagulation profile, suggesting "" hypercoagulability "" before initiation of therapy."	[]
Some of these findings represented the most extreme abnormalities seen in the entire group of patients; some increased further during therapy.	[]
One of these patients developed a myocardial infarction before receiving any medication, shortly after the base - line values were obtained.	[]
One patient developed retinopathy 19 months after she began therapy, and another developed thrombophlebitis after 27 months of therapy.	[]
The fourth patient developed thrombophlebitis 14 days after initiation of contraceptive therapy.	[]
All four patients were of the A or AB blood group.	[]
Previous studies suggested the possiblility of increased propensity for thromboembolic episodes in patients possessing the A antigen.	[]

BACKGROUND: Doxorubicin induces a self - perpetuating nephropathy characterized by early glomerular and late - onset tubular lesions in rats.	"Doxorubicin	12	23	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Doxorubicin"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We investigated the potential role of mitochondrial injury in the onset of these lesions.	[]
METHODS: Rats were treated with intravenous doxorubicin ( 1 mg kg ( - 1) week ( - 1)) for 7 weeks and were sacrificed either 1 week ( ' short - term ') or 30 weeks ( ' long - term ') following the last dose.	"doxorubicin	44	55	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""doxorubicin"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Additional rats received a single dose either 6 days or 2 h prior to euthanasia.	[]
All rats were killed at 48 weeks of age.	[]
Glomerular and tubular injury was monitored and correlated to the activity or expression of respiratory chain components.	[]
Finally, we quantified both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA) as well as superoxide production and the 4834 base pair ' common ' mtDNA deletion.	"superoxide	78	88	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""superoxide"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
RESULTS: The ' long - term ' group had significant glomerular and tubular lesions, depressed activities of mtDNA - encoded NADH dehydrogenase and cytochrome - c oxidase ( COX) and increased citrate synthase activity.	"citrate	190	197	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""citrate"", ""start_span"": 190, ""end_span"": 197, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In addition, expression of the mtDNA - encoded COX subunit I was reduced and mtDNA levels were decreased.	[]
In ' short - term ' rats, there were fewer tubular lesions, but similar numbers of glomerular lesions activity.	[]
Among all animals, glomerular and tubular injury were inversely correlated with mtDNA levels, mtDNA - encoded respiratory chain activities and with the expression of the mtDNA - encoded respiratory chain subunit COX - I.	[]
Injury was positively correlated with superoxide production and the activities of nucleus - encoded mitochondrial or cytoplasmic enzymes.	"superoxide	38	48	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""superoxide"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Kidneys from the ' long - term ' group showed more mtDNA deletions than in ' short - term ' animals and these were not observed in the other groups.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest an important role for quantitative and qualitative mtDNA alterations through the reduction of mtDNA - encoded respiratory chain function and induction of superoxide in doxorubicin - induced renal lesions.

Compared with the control group, the patients were impaired on a processing speed task ( p = 0. 032) and on a measure of immediate verbal memory ( p = 0. 026) after controlling for the use of hormone replacement therapy in both groups.	[]
Patient group performance was not significantly related to length of treatment or measures of psychological morbidity.	[]
The results showed specific impairments in processing speed and verbal memory in women receiving hormonal therapy for the treatment of breast cancer.	[]

The protein abundance of alpha - ENaC and beta - ENaC was increased in the inner stripe of the outer medulla ( ISOM) and in the inner medulla ( IM) but was not altered in the cortex.	[]
gamma - ENaC abundance was increased in the cortex, ISOM, and IM.	[]
Immunoperoxidase brightfield - and laser - scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy demonstrated increased targeting of alpha - ENaC, beta - ENaC, and gamma - ENaC subunits to the apical plasma membrane in the distal convoluted tubule ( DCT2), connecting tubule, and cortical and medullary collecting duct segments.

In conclusion, the increased or sustained expression of ENaC subunits combined with increased apical targeting in the DCT2, connecting tubule, and collecting duct are likely to play a role in the sodium retention associated with PAN - induced nephrotic syndrome.

The decreased abundance of NHE3, BSC - 1, TSC, and Na - K - ATPase may play a compensatory role to promote sodium excretion.

Pallidal stimulation: an alternative to pallidotomy?	[]
A resurgence of interest in the surgical treatment of Parkinson ' s disease ( PD) came with the rediscovery of posteroventral pallidotomy by Laitinen in 1985.	[]
Laitinen ' s procedure improved most symptoms in drug - resistant PD, which engendered wide interest in the neurosurgical community.	[]
Another lesioning procedure, ventrolateral thalamotomy, has become a powerful alternative to stimulate the nucleus ventralis intermedius, producing high long - term success rates and low morbidity rates.	[]
Pallidal stimulation has not met with the same success.	[]
"According to the literature pallidotomy improves the "" on "" symptoms of PD, such as dyskinesias, as well as the "" off "" symptoms, such as rigidity, bradykinesia, and on - off fluctuations."	[]

As standard practice at our institution, patients who are scheduled to receive a bone marrow transplant are treated prophylactically with forced hydration and bladder irrigation.	[]
In an attempt to obviate the inconvenience of bladder irrigation, we conducted a feasibility trial of uroprophylaxis with mesna, which neutralizes the hepatic metabolite of cyclophosphamide that causes hemorrhagic cystitis.

Consensus statement concerning cardiotoxicity occurring during haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, with special reference to systemic sclerosis and multiple sclerosis.	[]
Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is now a feasible and effective treatment for selected patients with severe autoimmune diseases.	[]
Worldwide, over 650 patients have been transplanted in the context of phase I and II clinical trials.	[]
The results are encouraging enough to begin randomised phase III trials.	[]
However, as predicted, significant transplant - related morbidity and mortality have been observed.	[]
This is primarily due to complications related to either the stage of the disease at transplant or due to infections.	[]
The number of deaths related to cardiac toxicity is low.	[]
However, caution is required when cyclophosphamide or anthracyclines such as mitoxantrone are used in patients with a possible underlying heart damage, for example, systemic sclerosis patients.

Does supplemental vitamin C increase cardiovascular disease risk in women with diabetes?	"vitamin C	18	27	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""vitamin C"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
BACKGROUND: Vitamin C acts as a potent antioxidant; however, it can also be a prooxidant and glycate protein under certain circumstances in vitro.	"Vitamin C	12	21	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Vitamin C"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
These observations led us to hypothesize that a high intake of vitamin C in diabetic persons might promote atherosclerosis.	"vitamin C	63	72	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""vitamin C"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the relation between vitamin C intake and mortality from cardiovascular disease.	"vitamin C	61	70	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""vitamin C"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
DESIGN: We studied the relation between vitamin C intake and mortality from total cardiovascular disease ( n = 281), coronary artery disease ( n = 175), and stroke ( n = 57) in 1923 postmenopausal women who reported being diabetic at baseline.	"vitamin C	40	49	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""vitamin C"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Adjusted relative risks of coronary artery disease were 1. 0, 0. 81, 0. 99, 1. 26, and 1. 91 ( P for trend = 0. 01) and of stroke were 1. 0, 0. 52, 1. 23, 2. 22, and 2. 57 ( P for trend < 0. 01).	[]
When dietary and supplemental vitamin C were analyzed separately, only supplemental vitamin C showed a positive association with mortality endpoints.

Optical coherence tomography can measure axonal loss in patients with ethambutol - induced optic neuropathy.	"ethambutol	70	80	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ethambutol"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
PURPOSE: To map and identify the pattern, in vivo, of axonal degeneration in ethambutol - induced optic neuropathy using optical coherence tomography ( OCT).	"ethambutol	77	87	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ethambutol"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Ethambutol is an antimycobacterial agent often used to treat tuberculosis.	"Ethambutol	0	10	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Ethambutol"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
A serious complication of ethambutol is an optic neuropathy that impairs visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and color vision.	"ethambutol	26	36	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ethambutol"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
However, early on, when the toxic optic neuropathy is mild and partly reversible, the funduscopic findings are often subtle and easy to miss.	[]
METHODS: Three subjects with a history of ethambutol ( EMB) - induced optic neuropathy of short -, intermediate -, and long - term visual deficits were administered a full neuro - ophthalmologic examination including visual acuity, color vision, contrast sensitivity, and fundus examination.	"ethambutol	42	52	Chemical/Drug"	"EMB	55	58	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ethambutol"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""EMB"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In addition, OCT ( OCT 3000, Humphrey - Zeiss, Dublin, CA) was performed on both eyes of each subject using the retinal nerve fiber layer ( RNFL) analysis protocol.	[]
OCT interpolates data from 100 points around the optic nerve to effectively map out the RNFL.	[]
RESULTS: The results were compared to the calculated average RNFL of normal eyes accumulated from four prior studies using OCT, n = 661.	[]
In all subjects with history of EMB - induced optic neuropathy, there was a mean loss of 72% nerve fiber layer thickness in the temporal quadrant ( patient A, with eventual recovery of visual acuity and fields, 58% loss; patient B, with intermediate visual deficits, 68% loss; patient C, with chronic visual deficits, 90% loss), with an average mean optic nerve thickness of 26 + / - 16 microm.	"EMB	32	35	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""EMB"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
There was a combined mean loss of 46% of fibers from the superior, inferior, and nasal quadrants in the ( six) eyes of all three subjects ( mean average thickness of 55 + / - 29 microm).	[]
In both sets ( four) of eyes of the subjects with persistent visual deficits ( patients B and C), there was an average loss of 79% of nerve fiber thickness in the temporal quadrant.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: The OCT results in these patients with EMB - induced optic neuropathy show considerable loss especially of the temporal fibers.	"EMB	52	55	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""EMB"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
This is consistent with prior histopathological studies that show predominant loss of parvo - cellular axons ( or small - caliber axons) within the papillo - macular bundle in toxic or hereditary optic neuropathies.	[]
OCT can be a valuable tool in the quantitative analysis of optic neuropathies.	[]
Additionally, in terms of management of EMB - induced optic neuropathy, it is important to properly manage ethambutol dosing in patients with renal impairment and to achieve proper transition to a maintenance dose once an appropriate loading dose has been reached.

Hypoxia in renal disease with proteinuria and / or glomerular hypertension.	[]
Despite the increasing need to identify and quantify tissue oxygenation at the cellular level, relatively few methods have been available.	[]
In this study, we developed a new hypoxia - responsive reporter vector using a hypoxia - responsive element of the 5 ' vascular endothelial growth factor untranslated region and generated a novel hypoxia - sensing transgenic rat.	[]
We then applied this animal model to the detection of tubulointerstitial hypoxia in the diseased kidney.	[]
With this model, we were able to identify diffuse cortical hypoxia in the puromycin aminonucleoside - induced nephrotic syndrome and focal and segmental hypoxia in the remnant kidney model.	"puromycin aminonucleoside	74	99	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""puromycin aminonucleoside"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Expression of the hypoxia - responsive transgene increased throughout the observation period, reaching 2. 2 - fold at 2 weeks in the puromycin aminonucleoside model and 2. 6 - fold at 4 weeks in the remnant kidney model, whereas that of vascular endothelial growth factor showed a mild decrease, reflecting distinct behaviors of the two genes.	"puromycin aminonucleoside	133	158	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""puromycin aminonucleoside"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The degree of hypoxia showed a positive correlation with microscopic tubulointerstitial injury in both models.	[]
Finally, we identified the localization of proliferating cell nuclear antigen - positive, ED - 1 - positive, and terminal dUTP nick - end labeled - positive cells in the hypoxic cortical area in the remnant kidney model.	[]
We propose here a possible pathological tie between chronic tubulointerstitial hypoxia and progressive glomerular diseases.	[]

It has been previously shown that myocardial contrast echocardiography is a valuable technique for delineating regions of myocardial underperfusion secondary to coronary occlusion and to critical coronary stenoses in the presence of hyperemic stimulation.	[]
The aim of this study was to determine whether myocardial contrast echocardiography performed with a stable solution of sonicated albumin could detect regions of myocardial underperfusion resulting from various degrees of coronary stenosis.	[]
The perfusion defect produced in 16 open chest dogs was compared with the anatomic area at risk measured by the postmortem dual - perfusion technique and with thallium - 201 single - photon emission tomography ( SPECT).	"thallium	159	167	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""thallium"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 167, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
During a transient ( 20 - s) coronary occlusion, a perfusion defect was observed with contrast echocardiography in 14 of the 15 dogs in which the occlusion was produced.	[]
The perfusion defect correlated significantly with the anatomic area at risk ( r = 0. 74; p less than 0. 002).	[]
During dipyridamole - induced hyperemia, 12 of the 16 dogs with a partial coronary stenosis had a visible area of hypoperfusion by contrast echocardiography.	"dipyridamole	7	19	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dipyridamole"", ""start_span"": 7, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

The size of the perfusion defect during stenosis correlated significantly with the anatomic area at risk ( r = 0. 61; p = 0. 02).	[]
Thallium - 201 SPECT demonstrated a perfusion defect in all 14 dogs analyzed during dipyridamole - induced hyperemia; the size of the perfusion defect correlated with the anatomic area at risk ( r = 0. 58; p less than 0. 03) and with the perfusion defect by contrast echocardiography ( r = 0. 58; p less than 0. 03).

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Because of their widespread use, the hematologic toxicity following coadministration of dexrazoxane and these three structurally different DNA cleavage enhancers was investigated: Sensitivity of human and murine blood progenitor cells to etoposide, daunorubicin, and doxorubicin + / - dexrazoxane was determined in granulocyte - macrophage colony forming assays.

Likewise, in vivo, B6D2F1 mice were treated with etoposide, daunorubicin, and doxorubicin, with or without dexrazoxane over a wide range of doses: posttreatment, a full hematologic evaluation was done.	"etoposide	49	58	Chemical/Drug"	"daunorubicin	60	72	Chemical/Drug"	"doxorubicin	78	89	Chemical/Drug"	"dexrazoxane	107	118	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""etoposide"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""daunorubicin"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""doxorubicin"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""dexrazoxane"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
RESULTS: Nontoxic doses of dexrazoxane reduced myelosuppression and weight loss from daunorubicin and etoposide in mice and antagonized their antiproliferative effects in the colony assay; however, dexrazoxane neither reduced myelosuppression, weight loss, nor the in vitro cytotoxicity from doxorubicin.

CONCLUSION: Although our findings support the observation that dexrazoxane reduces neither hematologic activity nor antitumor activity from doxorubicin clinically, the potent antagonism of daunorubicin activity raises concern; a possible interference with anticancer efficacy certainly would call for renewed attention.

Assessment of the onset and persistence of amnesia during procedural sedation with propofol.	"propofol	83	91	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""propofol"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
OBJECTIVES: To assess patients ' ability to repeat and recall words presented to them while undergoing procedural sedation with propofol, and correlate their recall with their level of awareness as measured by bispectral index ( BIS) monitoring.	"propofol	128	136	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""propofol"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METHODS: This was a prospective, single - intervention study of consenting adult patients undergoing procedural sedation with propofol between December 28, 2002, and October 31, 2003.	"propofol	126	134	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""propofol"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
BIS monitoring was initiated starting 3 minutes before the procedure and continuing until the patient had regained baseline mental status.	[]
At 1 - minute intervals during the procedural sedation, until the patient regained baseline mental status at the end of the procedure, a word from a standardized list was read aloud, and the patient was asked to immediately repeat the word to the investigator.	[]
The BIS score at the time the word was read and the patient ' s ability to repeat the word were recorded.	[]
After the procedure, the patient was asked to state all of the words from the list that he or she could recall, and to identify the last word recalled from prior to the start of the procedure and the first word recalled from after the procedure was completed.	[]
RESULTS: Seventy - five consenting patients were enrolled; one patient was excluded from data analysis for a protocol violation.	[]
No serious adverse events were noted during the procedural sedations.	[]
The mean ( + / - standard deviation) time of data collection was 16. 4 minutes ( + / - 7. 1; range 5 to 34 minutes).	[]
The mean initial ( preprocedure) BIS score was 97. 1 ( + / - 2. 3; range 92 to 99).	[]
The mean lowest BIS score occurring during these procedural sedations was 66. 9 ( + / - 14. 4; range 33 to 91).	[]
The mean lowest BIS score corresponding to the ability of the patient to immediately repeat words read from the list was 77. 1 ( 95% CI = 74. 3 to 80. 0).	[]
The mean highest BIS score corresponding to the inability to repeat words was 81. 5 ( 95% CI = 78. 1 to 84. 8).	[]
The mean BIS score corresponding to the last word recalled from prior to the initiation of the sedation was 96. 7 ( + / - 2. 4; range 84 to 98).	[]
The mean BIS score corresponding to the first word recalled after the procedure was completed was 91. 2 ( 95% CI = 88. 1 to 94. 3).	[]
All patients recalled at least one word that had been read to them during the protocol.	[]
The mean lowest BIS score for any recalled word was 91. 5 ( + / - 11. 1; range 79 to 98), and no words were recalled when the corresponding BIS score was less than 90.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: There is a range of BIS scores during which sedated patients are able to repeat words read to them but are not able to subsequently recall these words.	[]
Furthermore, patients had no recall of words repeated prior to procedural sedation in BIS ranges associated with recall after procedural sedation, suggestive of retrograde amnesia.	[]

Few cases of drug - induced hiccups have been reported related to macrolide antimicrobials.	"macrolide	66	75	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""macrolide"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Using the Naranjo adverse effect reaction probability scale this event could be classified as possible ( score 5 points), mostly because of the close temporal sequence, previous reports on this reaction with other macrolides and the absence of any alternative explanation for hiccups.	"macrolides	214	224	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""macrolides"", ""start_span"": 214, ""end_span"": 224, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Our hypothesis is that a vagal mechanism mediated by azithromycin could be the pathogenesis of hiccups in our patient.	"azithromycin	53	65	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""azithromycin"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of drug - induced hiccups is difficult and often achieved only by a process of elimination.	[]
However, macrolide antimicrobials have been reported to be associated with hiccups and vagal mechanism could explain the development of this side - effect.	"macrolide	9	18	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""macrolide"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

OBJECTIVE: To describe 3 patients with calcium carbonate - induced hypercalcemia and gain insights into the cause and management of the milk - alkali syndrome.	"calcium carbonate	39	56	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""calcium carbonate"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METHODS: We report the clinical and laboratory data in 3 patients who presented with severe hypercalcemia ( corrected serum calcium > or = 14 mg / dL) and review the pertinent literature on milk - alkali syndrome.	"calcium	124	131	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""calcium"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
RESULTS: The 3 patients had acute renal insufficiency, relative metabolic alkalosis, and low parathyroid hormone ( PTH), PTH - related peptide, and 1, 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations.	[]
No malignant lesion was found.	[]
Treatment included aggressive hydration and varied amounts of furosemide.	"furosemide	62	72	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""furosemide"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The 2 patients with the higher serum calcium concentrations received pamidronate intravenously ( 60 and 30 mg, respectively), which caused severe hypocalcemia.

A variety of abnormal sensory / motor behaviors associated with electrical discharges recorded from the bilateral brainstem were induced in adult WKY rats by mechanical ( electrode implants) and DC electrical current stimulations and by acute and chronic administration of cocaine.

Cocaine ( 40 mg / kg) was injected subcutaneously for an acute experiment and subsequent 20 mg / kg doses twice daily for 3 days in a chronic study.	"Cocaine	0	7	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Cocaine"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Cocaine generated more abnormal behaviors in the brainstem perturbation group, especially the electrically perturbated subjects.	"Cocaine	0	7	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Cocaine"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
"The abnormal behaviors were yawning, retrocollis, hyperactivity, hypersensitivity, "" beating drum "" behavior, squealing, head bobbing, circling, sniffing, abnormal posturing, and facial twitching."	[]
Shifts in the power frequency spectra of the discharge patterns were noted between quiet and pacing behavioral states.	[]
Hypersensitivity to various auditory, tactile, and visual stimulation was present and shifts in the brainstem ambient power spectral frequency occurred in response to tactile stimulation.	[]
These findings suggest that the brainstem generates and propagates pathological discharges that can be elicited by mechanical and DC electrical perturbation.	[]
Cocaine was found to activate the discharge system and thus induce abnormal behaviors that are generated at the discharge site and at distant sites to which the discharge propagates.

Definition and management of anemia in patients infected with hepatitis C virus.	[]
Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus ( HCV) can progress to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and end - stage liver disease.	[]
The current best treatment for HCV infection is combination therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin.

Although this regimen produces sustained virologic responses ( SVRs) in approximately 50% of patients, it can be associated with a potentially dose - limiting hemolytic anemia.	[]
Hemoglobin concentrations decrease mainly as a result of ribavirin - induced hemolysis, and this anemia can be problematic in patients with HCV infection, especially those who have comorbid renal or cardiovascular disorders.

In general, anemia can increase the risk of morbidity and mortality, and may have negative effects on cerebral function and quality of life.	[]
Although ribavirin - associated anemia can be reversed by dose reduction or discontinuation, this approach compromises outcomes by significantly decreasing SVR rates.	"ribavirin	9	18	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ribavirin"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Impact of alcohol exposure after pregnancy recognition on ultrasonographic fetal growth measures.	"alcohol	10	17	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""alcohol"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
BACKGROUND: More than 3 decades after Jones and Smith ( 1973) reported on the devastation caused by alcohol exposure on fetal development, the rates of heavy drinking during pregnancy remain relatively unchanged.	"alcohol	100	107	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""alcohol"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Early identification of fetal alcohol exposure and maternal abstinence led to better infant outcomes.	"alcohol	30	37	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""alcohol"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
This study examined the utility of biometry for detecting alcohol - related fetal growth impairment.	"alcohol	58	65	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""alcohol"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METHODS: We obtained fetal ultrasound measures from routine ultrasound examinations for 167 pregnant hazardous drinkers who were enrolled in a brief alcohol intervention study.	"alcohol	149	156	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""alcohol"", ""start_span"": 149, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The fetal measures for women who quit after learning of their pregnancies were compared with measures for women who continued some drinking throughout the course of their pregnancies.	[]
Because intensity of alcohol consumption is associated with poorer fetal outcomes, separate analyses were conducted for the heavy ( average of > or = 5 drinks per drinking day) alcohol consumers.	"alcohol	21	28	Chemical/Drug"	"alcohol	21	28	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""alcohol"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""alcohol"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Fetal measures from the heavy - exposed fetuses were also compared with measures from a nondrinking group that was representative of normal, uncomplicated pregnancies from our clinics.	[]
Analyses of covariance were used to determine whether there were differences between groups after controlling for influences of gestational age and drug abuse.	[]
RESULTS: Nearly half of the pregnant drinkers abstained after learning of their pregnancies.	[]
When women reportedly quit drinking early in their pregnancies, fetal growth measures were not significantly different from a non - alcohol - exposed group, regardless of prior drinking patterns.	"alcohol	132	139	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""alcohol"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Any alcohol consumption postpregnancy recognition among the heavy drinkers resulted in reduced cerebellar growth as well as decreased cranial to body growth in comparison with women who either quit drinking or who were nondrinkers.	"alcohol	4	11	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""alcohol"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Amphetamine abuse was predictive of larger cranial to body growth ratios.	"Amphetamine	0	11	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Amphetamine"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
CONCLUSIONS: Alterations in fetal biometric measurements were observed among the heavy drinkers only when they continued drinking after becoming aware of their pregnancies.	[]
Although the reliance on self - reported drinking is a limitation in this study, these findings support the benefits of early abstinence and the potential for ultrasound examinations in the detection of fetal alcohol effects.

Ethambutol - associated optic neuropathy.	"Ethambutol	0	10	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Ethambutol"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
INTRODUCTION: Ethambutol is used in the treatment of tuberculosis, which is still prevalent in Southeast Asia, and can be associated with permanent visual loss.	"Ethambutol	14	24	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Ethambutol"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We report 3 cases which presented with bitemporal hemianopia.	[]
CLINICAL PICTURE: Three patients with ethambutol - associated toxic optic neuropathy are described.	"ethambutol	38	48	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ethambutol"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
All 3 patients had loss of central visual acuity, colour vision ( Ishihara) and visual field.	[]
The visual field loss had a bitemporal flavour, suggesting involvement of the optic chiasm.	[]
TREATMENT: Despite stopping ethambutol on diagnosis, visual function continued to deteriorate for a few months.	"ethambutol	28	38	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ethambutol"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Subsequent improvement was mild in 2 cases.	[]
In the third case, visual acuity and colour vision normalised but the optic discs were pale.	[]
OUTCOME: All 3 patients had some permanent loss of visual function.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: Ethambutol usage is associated with permanent visual loss and should be avoided if possible or used with caution and proper ophthalmological follow - up.	"Ethambutol	13	23	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Ethambutol"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The author postulates that in cases of ethambutol associated chiasmopathy, ethambutol may initially affect the optic nerves and subsequently progress to involve the optic chiasm.

A 74 - year - old man with depressive symptoms was admitted to a psychiatric hospital due to insomnia, loss of appetite, exhaustion, and agitation.	[]
Medical treatment was initiated at a daily dose of 20 mg paroxetine and 1. 2 mg alprazolam.

The patient had a fever ( 38. 2 degrees C), fluctuating blood pressure ( between 165 / 90 and 130 / 70 mg mm Hg), and severe extrapyramidal symptoms.	[]
Laboratory tests showed an elevation of creatine phosphokinase ( 2218 IU / L), aspartate aminotransferase ( 134 IU / L), alanine aminotransferase ( 78 IU / L), and BUN ( 27. 9 mg / ml) levels.

7 days later, the fever disappeared and the patient ' s serum CPK levels were normalized ( 175 IU / L).	[]
This patient presented with symptoms of neuroleptic malignant syndrome ( NMS), thus demonstrating that NMS - like symptoms can occur after combined paroxetine and alprazolam treatment.	"paroxetine	148	158	Chemical/Drug"	"alprazolam	163	173	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""paroxetine"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""alprazolam"", ""start_span"": 163, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The adverse drug reaction score obtained by the Naranjo algorithm was 6 in our case, indicating a probable relationship between the patient ' s NMS - like adverse symptoms and the combined treatment used in this case.	[]
The involvement of physiologic and environmental aspects specific to this patient was suspected.	[]
Several risk factors for NMS should be noted in elderly depressive patients whose symptoms often include dehydration, agitation, malnutrition, and exhaustion.	[]
Careful therapeutic intervention is necessary in cases involving elderly patients who suffer from depression.	[]
Down - regulation of norepinephrine transporter function induced by chronic administration of desipramine linking to the alteration of sensitivity of local - anesthetics - induced convulsions and the counteraction by co - administration with local anesthetics.

In the control group ( n = 7), the mean arterial pressure ( MAP) was not manipulated.	[]
In the hypertensive group ( n = 7), the MAP was elevated by 25 - 30 mm Hg beginning 2 h after MCAO.	[]
Four hours after MCAO, the rats were killed and the brains harvested.	[]
The brains were sectioned along coronal planes spanning the distribution of ischemia produced by MCAO.	[]
Specific gravity ( SG) was determined in the subcortex and in two sites in the cortex ( core and periphery of the ischemic territory).	[]
The extent of neuronal injury was determined by 2, 3, 5 - triphenyltetrazolium staining.	[]
In the ischemic core, there was no difference in SG in the subcortex and cortex in the two groups.	[]
In the periphery of the ischemic territory, SG in the cortex was greater ( less edema accumulation) in the hypertensive group ( 1. 041 + / - 0. 001 vs 1. 039 + / - 0. 001, P less than 0. 05).	[]
The area of histochemical injury ( as a percent of the cross - sectional area of the hemisphere) was less in the hypertensive group ( 33 + / - 3% vs 21 + / - 2%, P less than 0. 05).	[]

Prolongation of the QT interval in the ECG of patients with torsade de pointes ( TdP) has been reported in methadone users.	"methadone	107	116	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""methadone"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
As heroin addicts sometimes faint while using illicit drugs, doctors might attribute too many episodes of syncope to illicit drug use and thereby underestimate the incidence of TdP in this special population, and the high mortality in this population may, in part, be caused by the proarrhythmic effect of methadone.

Of the patients at the Drug Addiction Service in the municipal of Copenhagen, 450 ( approximately 52%) were included.	[]
The QT interval was estimated from 12 lead ECGs.	[]
All participants were interviewed about any experience of syncope.	[]
The association between opioid dose and QT, and methadone dose and reporting of syncope was assessed using multivariate linear regression and logistic regression, respectively.	"methadone	48	57	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""methadone"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
RESULTS: Methadone dose was associated with longer QT interval of 0. 140 ms / mg ( p = 0. 002).	"Methadone	9	18	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Methadone"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

To demonstrate the relationship between peripheral iron overload and dopaminergic neuron loss in rat substantia nigra ( SN), in the present study we used fast cyclic voltammetry, tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH) immunohistochemistry, Perls ' iron staining, and high performance liquid chromatography - electrochemical detection to study the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and increased iron content in the SN of iron dextran overloaded animals.

Even more dramatic changes were found in chronic overload group.	[]
These results suggest that peripheral iron dextran can increase the iron level in the SN, where excessive iron causes the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons.

Diffusion weighted imaging ( DWI) of all patients revealed well demarcated hyperintense lesions within the subcortical white matter of the cerebral hemispheres and the corpus callosum, corresponding to areas of decreased proton diffusion on apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC) maps ( available in 21 / 27 patients).	[]
Lesions exceeded the confines of adjacent vascular territories.	[]
Complete resolution of symptoms within 1 - 4 days was accompanied by normalisation of ADC abnormalities.	[]
However, fluid attenuated inversion recovery ( FLAIR) sequences frequently revealed persistent white matter abnormalities.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: Several pathophysiological models of delayed leukoencephalopathy after exposure to intrathecal or systemic chemotherapy have been proposed.	[]
DWI findings in this cohort are indicative of cytotoxic oedema within cerebral white matter and lend support to an at least partially reversible metabolic derangement as the basis for this syndrome.	[]

DESIGN: Pooled data from 3 multicenter, double - masked, randomized, controlled, phase 2b / 3 clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of the 0. 59 - mg or 2. 1 - mg FA intravitreal implant or standard therapy were analyzed.	"FA	176	178	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""FA"", ""start_span"": 176, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
RESULTS: During the 3 - year follow - up, 71. 0% of implanted eyes had an IOP increase of 10 mm Hg or more than baseline and 55. 1%, 24. 7%, and 6. 2% of eyes reached an IOP of 30 mm Hg or more, 40 mm Hg or more, and 50 mm Hg or more, respectively.	[]
Topical IOP - lowering medication was administered in 74. 8% of implanted eyes, and IOP - lowering surgeries, most of which were trabeculectomies ( 76. 2%), were performed on 36. 6% of implanted eyes.	[]
Intraocular pressure - lowering surgeries were considered a success ( postoperative IOP of 6 - 21 mm Hg with or without additional IOP - lowering medication) in 85. 1% of eyes at 1 year.	[]
The rate of hypotony ( IOP < / = 5 mm Hg) following IOP - lowering surgery ( 42. 5%) was not different from that of implanted eyes not subjected to surgery ( 35. 4%) ( P =. 09).	[]
CONCLUSION: Elevated IOP is a significant complication with the FA intravitreal implant but may be controlled with medication and surgery.	[]
Myocardial Fas ligand expression increases susceptibility to AZT - induced cardiomyopathy.	"AZT	61	64	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""AZT"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
BACKGROUND: Dilated cardiomyopathy ( DCM) and myocarditis occur in many HIV - infected individuals, resulting in symptomatic heart failure in up to 5% of patients.	[]
Highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART) has significantly reduced morbidity and mortality of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS), but has resulted in an increase in cardiac and skeletal myopathies.	[]
METHODS AND RESULTS: In order to investigate whether the HAART component zidovudine ( 3 ' - azido - 2 ', 3 ' - deoxythymidine; AZT) triggers the Fas - dependent cell - death pathway and cause cytoskeletal disruption in a murine model of DCM, 8 - week - old transgenic ( expressing Fas ligand in the myocardium: FasL Tg) and non - transgenic ( NTg) mice received water ad libitum containing different concentrations of AZT ( 0, 0. 07, 0. 2, and 0. 7 mg / ml).

After 6 weeks, cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography and morphology was assessed by histopathologic and immunohistochemical methods.	[]
NTg and untreated FasL Tg mice showed little or no change in cardiac structure or function.	[]
In contrast, AZT - treated FasL Tg mice developed cardiac dilation and depressed cardiac function in a dose - dependent manner, with concomitant inflammatory infiltration of both ventricles.	"AZT	13	16	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""AZT"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
These changes were associated with an increased sarcolemmal expression of Fas and FasL, as well as increased activation of caspase 3, translocation of calpain 1 to the sarcolemma and sarcomere, and increased numbers of cells undergoing apoptosis.	[]
These were associated with changes in dystrophin and cardiac troponin I localization, as well as loss of sarcolemmal integrity.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: The expression of Fas ligand in the myocardium, as identified in HIV - positive patients, might increase the susceptibility to HAART - induced cardiomyopathy due to activation of apoptotic pathways, resulting in cardiac dilation and dysfunction.	[]

RESULTS: The incidence of pain was significantly lower in Groups R4 and R6 than in the control and R2 groups ( 12 / 32 and 6 / 31 vs 26 / 31 and 25 / 32, respectively, P < 0. 001).	[]
Pain was less severe in Groups R4 and R6 than in the control and R2 groups ( P < 0. 001).	[]
However, both incidence and severity of pain were not different between Groups R4 and R6.	[]
No significant complications were observed during the study.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: During induction of anaesthesia with TCI of propofol and remifentanil, a significant reduction in propofol infusion pain was achieved without significant complications by prior administration of remifentanil at a target Ce of 4 ng ml ( - 1).

METHODS: This comparative, Phase III, 12 - week, multicenter, prospective, randomized, double - blind study was conducted in Indian patients aged 18 to 65 years with established stage II hypertension.	[]
Patients were treated with oral FDC of T + A or A QD before breakfast for 12 weeks; blood pressure ( BP) and heart rate were measured in the sitting position.	[]
Primary efficacy end points were reduction in clinical systolic BP ( SBP) / diastolic BP ( DBP) from baseline to study end and number of responders ( ie, patients who achieved target SBP / DBP < 130 / < 80 mm Hg) at end of study.	[]
Tolerability was assessed by treatment - emergent adverse events, identified using physical examination, laboratory analysis, and electrocardiography.	[]
RESULTS: A total of 210 patients were enrolled in the study; 203 patients ( 143 men, 60 women) completed the study while 7 were lost to follow - up ( 4 patients in the T + A group and 3 in the A group) and considered with - drawn.	[]
At study end, statistically significant percentage reductions from baseline within groups and between groups were observed in SBP ( T + A [ - 27. 4%]; A [ - 16. 6%]) and DBP ( T + A [ - 20. 1%]; A [ - 13. 3%]) ( all, P < 0. 05).	[]
Response rates were 87. 3% ( 89 / 102) in the T + A group and 69. 3% ( 70 / 101) in the A group ( P < 0. 05).	[]
The prevalences of adverse events were not significantly different between the 2 treatment groups ( T + A, 16. 0% [ 17 / 106]; A, 15. 4% [ 16 / 104]).	[]
Peripheral edema was reported in 8. 5% patients ( 9 / 106) in the T + A group compared with 13. 5% ( 14 / 104) in the A group, and cough was reported in 3. 8% patients ( 4 / 106) in the T + A group and 1. 0% ( 1 / 104) patients in the A group; these differences did not reach statistical significance.	[]
The incidences of headache, dizziness, and diarrhea were similar between the 2 groups.	[]

OBJECTIVE: This large - scale retrospective review evaluates the sedation profile of dexmedetomidine.	"dexmedetomidine	85	100	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dexmedetomidine"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
AIM: To determine the hemodynamic responses, efficacy and adverse events associated with the use of high dose dexmedetomidine as the sole sedative for magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) studies.	"dexmedetomidine	110	125	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dexmedetomidine"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
BACKGROUND: Dexmedetomidine has been used at our institution since 2005 to provide sedation for pediatric radiological imaging studies.	"Dexmedetomidine	12	27	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Dexmedetomidine"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Over time, an effective protocol utilizing high dose dexmedetomidine as the sole sedative agent has evolved.	"dexmedetomidine	53	68	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dexmedetomidine"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METHODS / MATERIALS: As part of the ongoing Quality Assurance process, data on all sedations are reviewed monthly and protocols modified as needed.	[]

BACKGROUND: Spontaneous reporting systems for adverse drug reactions ( ADRs) are handicapped by under - reporting and limited detail on individual cases.	[]
We report an investigation from a local surveillance for serious adverse drug reactions associated with disease modifying anti - rheumatic drugs that was triggered by the occurrence of liver failure in two of our patients.	[]
METHODS: Serious ADR reports have been solicited from local clinicians by regular postcards over the past seven years.	[]
Patients ', who had hepatotoxicity on sulfasalazine and met a definition of a serious ADR, were identified.	"sulfasalazine	38	51	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sulfasalazine"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Two clinicians reviewed structured case reports and assessed causality by consensus and by using a causality assessment instrument.	[]
The likely frequency of hepatotoxicity with sulfasalazine was estimated by making a series of conservative assumptions.	"sulfasalazine	44	57	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sulfasalazine"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
RESULTS: Ten cases were identified: eight occurred during surveillance.	[]
Eight patients were hospitalised, two in hepatic failure - one died after a liver transplant.	[]
All but one event occurred within 6 weeks of treatment.	[]
Seven patients had a skin rash, three eosinophilia and one interstitial nephritis.	[]
Five patients were of Black British of African or Caribbean descent.	[]
Liver enzymes showed a hepatocellular pattern in four cases and a mixed pattern in six.	[]
Drug - related hepatotoxicity was judged probable or highly probable in 8 patients.	[]
The likely frequency of serious hepatotoxicity with sulfasalazine was estimated at 0. 4% of treated patients.	"sulfasalazine	52	65	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sulfasalazine"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Given VIP ' s role as an anti - inflammatory mediator, we hypothesized that VIP ( - / -) mice would exhibit enhanced inflammatory mediator expression after cystitis.	[]
A mouse inflammatory cytokine and receptor RT2 profiler array was used to determine regulated transcripts in the urinary bladder of wild type ( WT) and VIP ( - / -) mice with or without CYP - induced cystitis ( 150 mg / kg; i. p.; 48 h).	"CYP	186	189	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""CYP"", ""start_span"": 186, ""end_span"": 189, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Four binary comparisons were made: WT control versus CYP treatment ( 48 h), VIP ( - / -) control versus CYP treatment ( 48 h), WT control versus VIP ( - / -) control, and WT with CYP treatment ( 48 h) versus VIP ( - / -) with CYP treatment ( 48 h).

The genes presented represent ( 1) greater than 1. 5 - fold change in either direction and ( 2) the p value is less than 0. 05 for the comparison being made.	[]
Several regulated genes were validated using enzyme - linked immunoassays including IL - 1beta and CXCL1.	[]
CYP treatment significantly ( p < or = 0. 001) increased expression of CXCL1 and IL - 1beta in the urinary bladder of WT and VIP ( - / -) mice, but expression in VIP ( - / -) mice with CYP treatment was significantly ( p < or = 0. 001) greater ( 4. 2 - to 13 - fold increase) than that observed in WT urinary bladder ( 3. 6 - to 5 - fold increase).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The 32 men and 20 women underwent living donor liver transplantation.	[]
We started LMWH ( 25 IU / kg / h) on postoperative day ( POD) 1, switching to UFH ( 5000 U / d) on POD 2 or 3.	"UFH	78	81	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""UFH"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The dose of UFH was changed according to the activated clotting time level.	"UFH	12	15	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""UFH"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
HIT antibody levels were measured the day before surgery and on POD 7 and 14.	[]
Platelet count was measured daily for 3 weeks.	[]
RESULTS: The average platelet counts preoperatively, and on POD 7, 14, and 21 were 65, 88, 149, and 169 x 10 ( 9) / L, respectively.	[]
Two patients developed hepatic artery thrombosis on POD 11 and 19, respectively, although they were HIT antibody - negative and their platelet counts were stable.	[]
In 2 other patients, the platelet count decreased suddenly from 107 x 10 ( 9) / L on POD 4 to 65 x 10 ( 9) / L on POD 6 and from 76 x 10 ( 9) / L on POD 7 to 33 x 10 ( 9) / L on POD 9, respectively.	[]

Clinical use of the anthracycline doxorubicin ( DOX) is limited by its cardiotoxic effects, which are attributed to the induction of apoptosis.

To elucidate the possible role of the kinin B1 receptor ( B1R) during the development of DOX cardiomyopathy, we studied B1R knockout mice ( B1R ( - / -)) by investigating cardiac inflammation and apoptosis after induction of DOX - induced cardiomyopathy.

This was associated with a reduced activation state of AKT, as well as an increased bax / bcl2 ratio in Western blots, indicating cardiac apoptosis.	[]
Furthermore, mRNA levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 were increased in the cardiac tissue.	[]
In DOX B1R ( - / -) mice, cardiac dysfunction was improved compared to DOX control mice, which was associated with normalization of the bax / bcl - 2 ratio and interleukin 6, as well as AKT activation state.

Spectral analyses were conducted by dividing the whole spectrum into different frequency bands including delta, theta ( slow and fast), alpha - sigma, beta ( 1 and 2) and gamma ( 1 and 2) bands.	[]
Our results show that the most affected frequency bands were delta, theta, beta - 2 and gamma - 2 bands during the epileptiform activity and there were marked differences in terms of spectral densities between three investigated episodes ( basal activity, latent period and epileptiform activity).	[]
Our results may help to analyze novel data obtained using similar experimental models and the simple analysis method described here can be used in similar studies to investigate the basic neuronal mechanism of this or other types of experimental epilepsies.	[]

In the current study, we investigated whether a physiological intervention by feeding 40% high fat diet ( HFD), which induces obesity in male Sprague - Dawley rats ( 250 - 275 g), sensitizes to doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity.

A LD ( 10) dose ( 8 mg doxorubicin / kg, ip) administered on day 43 of the HFD feeding regimen led to higher cardiotoxicity, cardiac dysfunction, lipid peroxidation, and 80% mortality in the obese ( OB) rats in the absence of any significant renal or hepatic toxicity.

Decreased cardiac erythropoietin and increased SOCS3 further downregulated the cardioprotective JAK / STAT3 pathway.	[]
In conclusion, HFD - induced obese rats are highly sensitized to doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity by substantially downregulating cardiac mitochondrial ATP generation, increasing oxidative stress and downregulating the JAK / STAT3 pathway.

Taking into account that the sarcolemmal integrity is stabilized by the dystrophin - glycoprotein complex ( DGC) that connects actin and laminin in contractile machinery and extracellular matrix and by integrins, this study tests the hypothesis that isoproterenol affects sarcolemmal stability through changes in the DGC and integrins.

Immunofluorescent staining revealed that dystrophin is the most sensitive among the structures connecting the actin in the cardiomyocyte cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix.	[]
The sarcomeric actin dissolution occurred after the reduction or loss of dystrophin.	[]
Subsequently, after lysis of myofilaments, gamma - sarcoglycan, beta - dystroglycan, beta1 - integrin, and laminin alpha - 2 expressions were reduced followed by their breakdown, as epiphenomena of the myocytolytic process.	[]
In conclusion, administration of isoproterenol to rats results in primary loss of dystrophin, the most sensitive among the structural proteins that form the DGC that connects the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton in cardiomyocyte.

At 550 mg / m2 / d, three patients experienced nonurologic toxicity; confusion ( 1), nausea ( 1), and Grade 2 leukopenia ( 1).	[]
The recommended dose of 500 mg / m2 / d delivers a total dose of 7 g / m2 per cycle, which is comparable to that delivered in clinical practice for bolus or short - term infusion.	[]

The number, time of onset, duration and the intensity of the convulsions or absence of convulsions were recorded.	[]
RESULTS: The results showed that IP administration of bupropion HCl 120 mg / kg by bolus injection induced convulsions in 6 out of 10 mice ( 60% of convulsing mice) in group 1.	"bupropion HCl	54	67	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""bupropion HCl"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Logistic regression analysis revealed that infusion time was significant ( p = 0. 0004; odds ratio = 0. 974) and increasing the IP infusion time of bupropion HCl 120 mg / kg was associated with a 91% reduced odds of convulsions at infusion times of 15 to 90 min compared to bolus injection.

Further increase in infusion time resulted in further reduction in the odds of convulsions to 99. 8% reduction at 240 min.	[]
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the demonstration of an inverse relationship between infusion time of a fixed and convulsive dose of bupropion and the risk of convulsions in a prospective study is novel.

All patients engrafted, and only 1 patient experienced grade IV mucositis.	[]
Nine patients ( 37%) developed acute grade II - IV GVHD, and 11 of 17 evaluable patients ( 64%) developed chronic extensive GVHD.	[]
Transplantation - associated microangiopathy ( TMA) occurred in 7 patients ( 29%), with 2 cases of acute renal failure.	[]

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review first published in 2005.	[]
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of long - term HT on mortality, cardiovascular outcomes, cancer, gallbladder disease, cognition, fractures and quality of life.	[]
SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the following databases to November 2007: Trials Register of the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biological Abstracts.	[]
Also relevant non - indexed journals and conference abstracts.	[]
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised double - blind trials of HT versus placebo, taken for at least one year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women.	[]
HT included oestrogens, with or without progestogens, via oral, transdermal, subcutaneous or transnasal routes.	"oestrogens	12	22	Chemical/Drug"	"progestogens	40	52	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""oestrogens"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""progestogens"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.	[]
MAIN RESULTS: Nineteen trials involving 41, 904 women were included.	[]
In relatively healthy women, combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo - embolism or coronary event ( after one year ' s use), stroke ( after three years), breast cancer and gallbladder disease.	[]
Long - term oestrogen - only HT significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo - embolism, stroke and gallbladder disease ( after one to two years, three years and seven years ' use respectively), but did not significantly increase the risk of breast cancer.	"oestrogen	12	21	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""oestrogen"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The only statistically significant benefits of HT were a decreased incidence of fractures and ( for combined HT) colon cancer, with long - term use.	[]
Among women aged over 65 who were relatively healthy ( i. e. generally fit, without overt disease) and taking continuous combined HT, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of dementia.	[]
Among women with cardiovascular disease, long - term use of combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo - embolism. One trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy 50 to 59 year old women taking combined continuous HT and 1637 taking oestrogen - only HT, versus similar - sized placebo groups.	"oestrogen	272	281	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""oestrogen"", ""start_span"": 272, ""end_span"": 281, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The only significantly increased risk reported was for venous thrombo - embolism in women taking combined continuous HT: their absolute risk remained low, at less than 1 / 500.	[]
However, this study was not powered to detect differences between groups of younger women.	[]
AUTHORS ' CONCLUSIONS: HT is not indicated for the routine management of chronic disease.	[]
We need more evidence on the safety of HT for menopausal symptom control, though short - term use appears to be relatively safe for healthy younger women.	[]

A 2 - wk administration of LiCl ( 4 mmol. kg ( - 1). day ( - 1) ip) in mPGES - 1 + / + mice led to a marked polyuria with hyposmotic urine.	"LiCl	27	31	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""LiCl"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
This was associated with elevated renal mPGES - 1 protein expression and increased urine PGE ( 2) excretion.	[]
In contrast, mPGES - 1 - / - mice were largely resistant to lithium - induced polyuria and a urine concentrating defect, accompanied by nearly complete blockade of high urine PGE ( 2) and cAMP output.

Immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative ( q) RT - PCR consistently detected a significant decrease in aquaporin - 2 ( AQP2) protein expression in both the renal cortex and medulla of lithium - treated + / + mice.

This decrease was significantly attenuated in the - / - mice.	[]
qRT - PCR detected similar patterns of changes in AQP2 mRNA in the medulla but not in the cortex.	[]
Similarly, the total protein abundance of the Na - K - 2Cl cotransporter ( NKCC2) in the medulla but not in the cortex of the + / + mice was significantly reduced by lithium treatment.

All but one patient were managed using cardiopulmonary bypass.	[]
No evidence of brain ischemic, metabolic, or hyperthermia - induced causes for their seizures was apparent.	[]
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that use of high - dose TXA in older patients in conjunction with cardiopulmonary bypass and open - chamber cardiac surgery is associated with clinical seizures in susceptible patients.

We have used a murine model of AIDS, infection of female C57BL / 6 mice with LP - BM5 murine leukaemia ( MuLV) virus, to determine if AZT - induced anaemia is due, in part, to decreased responsiveness of erythropoietic precursors ( BFU - e) to erythropoietin ( EPO).

Sedation depth during spinal anesthesia and the development of postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture repair.	[]
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether limiting intraoperative sedation depth during spinal anesthesia for hip fracture repair in elderly patients can decrease the prevalence of postoperative delirium.	[]
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a double - blind, randomized controlled trial at an academic medical center of elderly patients ( > or = 65 years) without preoperative delirium or severe dementia who underwent hip fracture repair under spinal anesthesia with propofol sedation.	"propofol	262	270	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""propofol"", ""start_span"": 262, ""end_span"": 270, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Sedation depth was titrated using processed electroencephalography with the bispectral index ( BIS), and patients were randomized to receive either deep ( BIS, approximately 50) or light ( BIS, > or = 80) sedation.	[]
Postoperative delirium was assessed as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( Third Edition Revised) criteria using the Confusion Assessment Method beginning at any time from the second day after surgery.	[]
RESULTS: From April 2, 2005, through October 30, 2008, a total of 114 patients were randomized.	[]
The prevalence of postoperative delirium was significantly lower in the light sedation group ( 11 / 57 [ 19%] vs 23 / 57 [ 40%] in the deep sedation group; P =. 02), indicating that 1 incident of delirium will be prevented for every 4. 7 patients treated with light sedation.	[]
The mean + / - SD number of days of delirium during hospitalization was lower in the light sedation group than in the deep sedation group ( 0. 5 + / - 1. 5 days vs 1. 4 + / - 4. 0 days; P =. 01).	[]
CONCLUSION: The use of light propofol sedation decreased the prevalence of postoperative delirium by 50% compared with deep sedation.	"propofol	29	37	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""propofol"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

The protective role of Nrf2 in streptozotocin - induced diabetic nephropathy.	"streptozotocin	31	45	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""streptozotocin"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
OBJECTIVE: Diabetic nephropathy is one of the major causes of renal failure, which is accompanied by the production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS).	"oxygen	128	134	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""oxygen"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Nrf2 is the primary transcription factor that controls the antioxidant response essential for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis.	[]
Here, we report our findings demonstrating a protective role of Nrf2 against diabetic nephropathy.	[]
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We explore the protective role of Nrf2 against diabetic nephropathy using human kidney biopsy tissues from diabetic nephropathy patients, a streptozotocin - induced diabetic nephropathy model in Nrf2 ( - / -) mice, and cultured human mesangial cells.	"streptozotocin	169	183	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""streptozotocin"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 183, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
RESULTS: The glomeruli of human diabetic nephropathy patients were under oxidative stress and had elevated Nrf2 levels.	[]
In the animal study, Nrf2 was demonstrated to be crucial in ameliorating streptozotocin - induced renal damage.	"streptozotocin	73	87	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""streptozotocin"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
This is evident by Nrf2 ( - / -) mice having higher ROS production and suffering from greater oxidative DNA damage and renal injury compared with Nrf2 ( + / +) mice.	[]
Mechanistic studies in both in vivo and in vitro systems showed that the Nrf2 - mediated protection against diabetic nephropathy is, at least, partially through inhibition of transforming growth factor - beta1 ( TGF - beta1) and reduction of extracellular matrix production.	[]
In human renal mesangial cells, high glucose induced ROS production and activated expression of Nrf2 and its downstream genes.	"glucose	37	44	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Furthermore, activation or overexpression of Nrf2 inhibited the promoter activity of TGF - beta1 in a dose - dependent manner, whereas knockdown of Nrf2 by siRNA enhanced TGF - beta1 transcription and fibronectin production.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: This work clearly indicates a protective role of Nrf2 in diabetic nephropathy, suggesting that dietary or therapeutic activation of Nrf2 could be used as a strategy to prevent or slow down the progression of diabetic nephropathy.	[]

This was accompanied by a lower activity of N - acetyl - beta - D - glucosaminidase, together with a decrease of lipid peroxidation and increase of antioxidant systems.	[]
Metformin also protected the kidney from histological damage 6 days after gentamicin administration.

These in vivo markers of kidney dysfunction and their correction by metformin were complemented by in vitro studies of mitochondrial function.	"metformin	68	77	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""metformin"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We found that gentamicin treatment depleted respiratory components ( cytochrome c, NADH), probably due to the opening of mitochondrial transition pores.	"gentamicin	14	24	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""gentamicin"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
These injuries, partly mediated by a rise in reactive oxygen species from the electron transfer chain, were significantly decreased by metformin.	"oxygen	54	60	Chemical/Drug"	"metformin	135	144	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""oxygen"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""metformin"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Risk of renal failure, Injury to the kidney, Failure of kidney function, Loss of kidney function, and End - stage renal damage ( RIFLE criteria) were used to define CIN and its incidence in the study population.	[]
Accordingly, among the 15 CIN patients ( 18. 75%), 7. 5% of the patients in group A had increased risk and 3. 75% had renal injury, whereas 5% of group B had increased risk and 2. 5% had renal injury.	[]
Whereas 33. 3% of the patients with CIN were among those who received the proper dosage of CM, the percentage increased to 66. 6% among those who received larger doses, with a significant difference in the incidence of CIN related to the different dosages of CM ( p = 0. 014).

Fear - potentiated startle, but not light - enhanced startle, is enhanced by anxiogenic drugs.	[]
RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The light - enhanced startle paradigm ( LES) is suggested to model anxiety, because of the non - specific cue and the long - term effect.	[]
In contrast, the fear - potentiated startle ( FPS) is suggested to model conditioned fear.	[]
However, the pharmacological profiles of these two paradigms are very similar.	[]
The present study investigated the effects of putative anxiogenic drugs on LES and FPS and aimed at determining the sensitivity of LES for anxiogenic drugs and to potentially showing a pharmacological differentiation between these two paradigms.	[]
METHODS: Male Wistar rats received each dose of the alpha ( 2) - adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine ( 0. 25 - 1. 0mg / kg), the 5 - HT ( 2C) receptor agonist m - chlorophenylpiperazine ( mCPP, 0. 5 - 2. 0mg / kg) or the GABA ( A) inverse receptor agonist pentylenetetrazole ( PTZ, 3 - 30mg / kg) and were subsequently tested in either LES or FPS.

Furthermore, yohimbine increased baseline startle amplitude in the LES, while mCPP suppressed baseline startle in both the LES and FPS and PTZ suppressed baseline startle in the FPS.

CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to findings in the FPS paradigm, none of the drugs were able to exacerbate the LES response.	[]
Thus, a clear pharmacological differentiation was found between LES and FPS.	[]

It is widely believed that dopamine ( DA) mediates methamphetamine ( METH) - induced toxicity to brain dopaminergic neurons, because drugs that interfere with DA neurotransmission decrease toxicity, whereas drugs that increase DA neurotransmission enhance toxicity.	"dopamine	27	35	Chemical/Drug"	"DA	38	40	Chemical/Drug"	"methamphetamine	51	66	Chemical/Drug"	"METH	69	73	Chemical/Drug"	"DA	38	40	Chemical/Drug"	"DA	38	40	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dopamine"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""DA"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""methamphetamine"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""METH"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""DA"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""DA"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
However, temperature effects of drugs that have been used to manipulate brain DA neurotransmission confound interpretation of the data.	"DA	78	80	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""DA"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Here we show that the recently reported ability of L - dihydroxyphenylalanine to reverse the protective effect of alpha - methyl - para - tyrosine on METH - induced DA neurotoxicity is also confounded by drug effects on body temperature.

Further, we show that mice genetically engineered to be deficient in brain DA develop METH neurotoxicity, as long as the thermic effects of METH are preserved.

In addition, we demonstrate that mice genetically engineered to have unilateral brain DA deficits develop METH - induced dopaminergic deficits that are of comparable magnitude on both sides of the brain.	"DA	86	88	Chemical/Drug"	"METH	106	110	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""DA"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""METH"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Taken together, these findings demonstrate that DA is not essential for the development of METH - induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity and suggest that mechanisms independent of DA warrant more intense investigation.

Although it is difficult to define causality in a case report, it is logical to think that a beta - agonist like salbutamol ( known to induce tachycardia) may be the trigger of adrenergic reflexes originating in the esophagus while swallowing and that a beta - blocker such as atenolol ( that blocks the adrenergic activity) may relieve it.

The inferior colliculus ( IC) is primarily involved in the processing of auditory information, but it is distinguished from other auditory nuclei in the brainstem by its connections with structures of the motor system.	[]
Functional evidence relating the IC to motor behavior derives from experiments showing that activation of the IC by electrical stimulation or excitatory amino acid microinjection causes freezing, escape - like behavior, and immobility.

The results showed that intracollicular microinjection of MK - 801 and AP7 previous to systemic injections of haloperidol significantly attenuated the catalepsy, as indicated by a reduced latency to step down from a horizontal bar.

BACKGROUND: Altered serotonergic neural transmission is hypothesized to be a susceptibility factor for psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia.	[]
The serotonin 6 ( 5 - HT6) receptor is therapeutically targeted by several second generation antipsychotics, such as clozapine and olanzapine, and d - amphetamine - induced hyperactivity in rats is corrected with the use of a selective 5 - HT6 receptor antagonist.

METHODS: We followed up all transplant - free survivors of paracetamol - induced acute liver injury, hospitalized in a Danish national referral centre during 1984 - 2004.	"paracetamol	59	70	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""paracetamol"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We compared age - specific mortality rates from 1 year post - discharge through 2008 between those in whom the liver injury led to an acute liver failure and those in whom it did not.	[]
RESULTS: We included 641 patients.	[]
On average, age - specific mortality rates were slightly higher for the 101 patients whose paracetamol - induced liver injury had caused an acute liver failure ( adjusted mortality rate ratio = 1. 70, 95% CI 1. 02 - 2. 85), but the association was age - dependent, and no survivors of acute liver failure died of liver disease, whereas suicides were frequent in both groups.	"paracetamol	91	102	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""paracetamol"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
These observations speak against long - term effects of acute liver failure.	[]
More likely, the elevated mortality rate ratio resulted from incomplete adjustment for the greater prevalence of substance abuse among survivors of acute liver failure.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: Paracetamol - induced acute liver failure did not affect long - term mortality.	"Paracetamol	13	24	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Paracetamol"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

AIM: Experimental and clinical studies have revealed that hippocampal DBS can control epileptic activity, but the mechanism of action is obscure and optimal stimulation parameters are not clearly defined.	[]
The aim was to evaluate the effects of high frequency hippocampal stimulation on cortical epileptic activity in penicillin - induced epilepsy model.	"penicillin	112	122	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""penicillin"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty - five Sprague - Dawley rats were implanted DBS electrodes.	[]
In group - 1 ( n = 10) hippocampal DBS was off and in the group - 2 ( n = 10) hippocampal DBS was on ( 185 Hz, 0. 5V, 1V, 2V, and 5V for 60 sec) following penicillin G injection intracortically.

In the control group, hippocampal stimulation alone lead only to diffuse slowing of cerebral bioelectrical activity at 5V stimulation.	[]
CONCLUSION: Our results revealed that continuous high frequency stimulation of the hippocampus suppressed acute cortical epileptic activity effectively without causing secondary epileptic discharges.	[]

Midline B3 serotonin nerves in rat medulla are involved in hypotensive effect of methyldopa.

Previous experiments in this laboratory have shown that microinjection of methyldopa onto the ventrolateral cells of the B3 serotonin neurons in the medulla elicits a hypotensive response mediated by a projection descending into the spinal cord.

In spontaneously hypertensive, stroke - prone rats, microinjection of methyldopa into the area of the midline B3 serotonin cell group in the ventral medulla caused a potent hypotension of 30 - 40 mm Hg, which was maximal 2 - 3 h after administration and was abolished by the serotonin neurotoxin 5, 7 - dihydroxytryptamine ( 5, 7 - DHT) injected intracerebroventricularly.	"methyldopa	70	80	Chemical/Drug"	"serotonin	113	122	Chemical/Drug"	"serotonin	113	122	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""methyldopa"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""serotonin"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""serotonin"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
However, intraspinal injection of 5, 7 - DHT to produce a more selective lesion of only descending serotonin projections in the spinal cord did not affect this hypotension.	"serotonin	99	108	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""serotonin"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Further, 5, 7 - DHT lesion of serotonin nerves travelling in the median forebrain bundle, one of the main ascending pathways from the B3 serotonin cells, did not affect the fall in blood pressure associated with a midline B3 serotonin methyldopa injection.	"serotonin	30	39	Chemical/Drug"	"serotonin	30	39	Chemical/Drug"	"serotonin	30	39	Chemical/Drug"	"methyldopa	235	245	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""serotonin"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""serotonin"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""serotonin"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""methyldopa"", ""start_span"": 235, ""end_span"": 245, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
It is concluded therefore that, unlike the ventrolateral B3 cells which mediate a methyldopa - induced hypotension via descending projections, the midline serotonin B3 cells in the medulla contribute to the hypotensive action of methyldopa, either by way of an ascending projection which does not pass through the median forebrain bundle, or through a projection restricted to the caudal brainstem.

Transient contralateral rotation following unilateral substantia nigra lesion reflects susceptibility of the nigrostriatal system to exhaustion by amphetamine.	"amphetamine	147	158	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""amphetamine"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Following unilateral 6 - OHDA induced SN lesion, a transient period of contralateral rotation has been reported to precede the predominant ipsilateral circling.	"6 - OHDA	21	29	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""6 - OHDA"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In order to clarify the nature of this initial contralateral rotation we examined the effect of the duration of recovery period after the lesion, on amphetamine - induced rotational behavior.	"amphetamine	149	160	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""amphetamine"", ""start_span"": 149, ""end_span"": 160, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Three days post lesion, most rats circled predominantly contralaterally to the lesion.	[]
Such contralateral rotation may result from either degeneration - induced breakdown of the DA pool, or lesion - induced increase of DA turnover in the spared neurons.	[]
A substantial degree of contralateral preference was still evident when amphetamine was administered for the first time 24 days after lesioning, indicating involvement of spared cells in the contralateral rotation.	"amphetamine	72	83	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""amphetamine"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
However, regardless of the duration of recovery ( and irrespective of either lesion volume, amphetamine dose, or post - lesion motor exercise), amphetamine - induced rotation tended to become gradually more ipsilateral as the observation session progressed, and all rats circled ipsilaterally to the lesion in response to further amphetamine injections.

Rats were pretreated with saline or nicotine ( 1. 5 mg / kg per day) by subcutaneously implanting each animal with an Alzet osmotic mini - pump which continuously released saline or nicotine for 1, 5 and 14 days.

At the end of each pretreatment period, animals were used for ( i) determining their locomotor response to acutely injected nicotine ( 0. 2 mg / kg, s. c.) and ( ii) measuring the density of L - [ 3H] nicotine and [ 3H] spiperone binding sites in the striatum.

In rats which were pretreated with nicotine for 5 days, there was a significant increase in the nicotine - stimulated locomotor response which was associated with an increase in the number of L - [ 3H] nicotine binding sites and also with an elevated dopamine ( DA) level in the striatum.

However, this response was correlated with an elevated number of striatal [ 3H] spiperone binding sites, whereas the number of striatal L - [ 3H] nicotine binding sites and the striatal DA level were normal.

These results suggest that chronic nicotine - treated rats develop locomotor hyperactivity in response to nicotine initially due to increases of both the density of nicotinic receptors and DA concentration, followed by inducing DA receptor supersensitivity in the striatum.

The two treatment regimens were equally efficacious.	[]
Nephrotoxicity occurred in a similar proportion in patients treated with netilmicin and tobramycin ( 17% vs 11%).

Ototoxicity occurred in four ( 9. 5%) of 42 netilmicin and piperacillin and in 12 ( 22%) of 54 tobramycin and piperacillin - treated patients.

Of those evaluated with posttherapy audiograms, three of four netilmicin and piperacillin - treated patients had auditory thresholds return to baseline compared with one of nine tobramycin and piperacillin - treated patients.

The number of greater than or equal to 15 - dB increases in auditory threshold as a proportion of total greater than or equal to 15 - dB changes ( increases and decreases) was significantly lower in netilmicin and piperacillin - vs tobramycin and piperacillin - treated patients ( 18 of 78 vs 67 of 115).

Urinary enzymes and protein patterns as indicators of injury to different regions of the kidney.	[]
Acute experimental models of renal damage to the proximal tubular, glomerular, and papillary regions of the rat were produced by administration of hexachloro - 1: 3 - butadiene ( HCBD), puromycin aminonucleoside ( PAN), and 2 - bromoethylamine ( BEA), respectively.

Several routine indicators of nephrotoxicity, the enzymes alkaline phosphatase and N - acetyl - beta - glucosaminidase, and the molecular weight of protein excretion were determined on urine samples.	[]
Tubular damage produced by HCBD or BEA was discriminated both quantitatively and qualitatively from glomerular damage produced by PAN.	"HCBD	27	31	Chemical/Drug"	"BEA	35	38	Chemical/Drug"	"PAN	130	133	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""HCBD"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""BEA"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""PAN"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The latter was characterized by a pronounced increase in protein excretion, especially proteins with molecular weight greater than 40, 000 Da.	[]
In contrast, protein excretion in tubular damage was raised only slightly and characterized by excretion of proteins of a wide range of molecular weights.	[]
Proximal tubular damage caused by HCBD and papillary damage caused by BEA were distinguished both by conventional urinalysis ( volume and specific gravity) and by measurement of the two urinary enzymes.	"HCBD	34	38	Chemical/Drug"	"BEA	70	73	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""HCBD"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""BEA"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Alkaline phosphatase and glucose were markedly and transiently elevated in proximal tubular damage and N - acetyl - beta - glucosaminidase showed a sustained elevation in papillary damage.	"glucose	25	32	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
It is concluded that both selective urinary enzymes and the molecular weight pattern of urinary proteins can be used to provide diagnostic information about the possible site of renal damage.	[]
A catch in the Reye.	[]
Twenty - six cases of Reye syndrome from The Children ' s Hospital, Camperdown, Australia, occurring between 1973 and 1982 were reviewed.	[]
Of these, 20 cases met the US Public Health Service Centers for Disease Control criteria for the diagnosis of Reye syndrome.	[]
Aspirin or salicylate ingestion had occurred in only one of the 20 cases ( 5%), and paracetamol ( acetaminophen) had been administered in only six of the cases ( 30%).

Pathologic confirmation of the diagnosis of Reye syndrome was accomplished in 90% of the cases.	[]
The incidence of Reye syndrome in New South Wales, Australia, is estimated from this study to be approximately nine cases per 1 million children compared with recent US data of ten to 20 cases per 1 million children and three to seven cases per 1 million children in Great Britain.	[]
The mortality for these Reye syndrome cases in Australia was 45% as compared with a 32% case - fatality rate in the United States.	[]
In Australia, the pediatric usage of aspirin has been extremely low for the past 25 years ( less than 1% of total dosage units sold), with paracetamol ( acetaminophen) dominating the pediatric analgesic and antipyretic market.

The role of cyclosporine ( CSA) alone or in combination with various chemotherapeutics in the development of renal toxicity was evaluated in rats.

The combined administration of CSA and various chemotherapeutic drugs with a nephrotoxic potential, such as gentamicin ( at therapeutic doses), amphothericin B and ketoconazole, which are frequently used in immunosuppressed patients, did not aggravate the CSA induced toxicity in the rat model.

If this were so, patients with coronary artery disease might be especially susceptible.	[]
Thus, myocardial electrical excitability was measured in patients with mild essential hypertension and known coronary artery disease after 8 weeks of treatment with a potassium - conserving diuretic ( amiloride) and a similar period on a potassium - losing diuretic ( chlorthalidone) in a randomised study.

Plasma potassium concentrations were on average 1 mmol / L lower during the chlorthalidone phase compared to amiloride therapy.

Blood pressure and volume states as assessed by bodyweight, plasma renin and noradrenaline ( norepinephrine) concentrations were similar on the 2 regimens.

Compared to amiloride treatment, the chlorthalidone phase was associated with an increased frequency of ventricular ectopic beats ( 24 - hour Holter monitoring) and a higher Lown grading, increased upslope and duration of the monophasic action potential, prolonged ventricular effective refractory period, and increased electrical instability during programmed ventricular stimulation.

The above results indicate that because potassium - losing diuretic therapy can increase myocardial electrical excitability in patients with ischaemic heart disease, even minor falls in plasma potassium concentrations are probably best avoided in such patients.

All of these symptoms, probably caused by the vasodilating effect of the two agents, were of mild degree and no special treatment was required.	[]
Intraplatelet cAMP content was gradually but significantly increased to 9. 84 + / - 4. 59 pmol per 10 ( 9) platelets at day 14 in comparison with the initial value ( 6. 87 + / - 2. 25 pmol).

Proteinuria appeared in all series, but was 2 - 5 times more intense ( p > 0. 001) and prolonged after doxorubicin treatment ( 400 - 700 mg / day), without significant difference between DXNP and DX.

Prostaglandin E2 - induced bladder hyperactivity in normal, conscious rats: involvement of tachykinins?

In normal conscious rats investigated by continuous cystometry, intravesically instilled prostaglandin ( PG) E2 facilitated micturition and increased basal intravesical pressure.	[]
The effect was attenuated by both the NK1 receptor selective antagonist RP 67, 580 and the NK2 receptor selective antagonist SR 48, 968, given intra - arterially, suggesting that it was mediated by stimulation of both NK1 and NK2 receptors.	[]
Intra - arterially given PGE2 produced a distinct increase in bladder pressure before initiating a micturition reflex, indicating that the PG had a direct contractant effect on the detrusor smooth muscle.

The effect of intra - arterial PGE2 could not be blocked by intra - arterial RP 67, 580 or SR 48, 968, which opens the possibility that the micturition reflex elicited by intra - arterial PGE2 was mediated by pathways other than the reflex initiated when the PG was given intravesically.

The present results thus suggest that intra - arterial PGE2, given near the bladder, may initiate micturition in the normal rat chiefly by directly contracting the smooth muscle of the detrusor.

Initial studies ( Bornstein 1968) showed that it possessed no respiratory suppressant effects and no addiction liability.	[]
Subsequently, however, several articles reporting abuse of this drug have appeared in the literature.	[]
The drug is known to cause a variety of acute toxic effects, ranging from nausea, restlessness, insomnia, ataxia, slurred speech and nystagmus to mood changes, perceptual alterations, inattention, disorientation and aggressive behavior ( Rammer et al 1988; Katona and Watson 1986; Isbell and Fraser 1953; Devlin et al 1985; McCarthy 1971; Dodds and Revai 1967; Degkwitz 1964; Hildebrand et al 1989).

Left ventricular end - diastolic pressure and left ventricular end - diastolic volume fell in each patient given ouabain, even though they were initially elevated in only two patients.	"ouabain	113	120	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ouabain"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Left ventricular end - diastolic pressure fell from 11. 5 + / - 1. 4 ( mean + / - SE) to 5. 6 + / - 0. 9 mm Hg ( P less than 0. 001) and left ventricular end - diastolic volume fell from 100 + / - 17 to 82 + / - 12 ml / m2 ( P less than 0. 01) 1 h after ouabain infusion was completed.

The maximum velocity of contractile element shortening increased from 1. 68 + / - 0. 11 ml / s to 2. 18 + / - 0. 21 muscle - lengths / s ( P less than 0. 05) and is consistent with an increase in contractility.	[]
No significant change in these parameters occurred in the control patients.	[]
No significant change in myocardial oxygen consumption occurred after ouabain administration but this may be related to a greater decrease in mean arterial pressure in the ouabain patients than in the control patients.

We conclude that in patients with chronic coronary artery disease who are not in clinical congestive heart failure left ventricular end - diastolic volume falls after ouabain administration even when it is initially normal.	"ouabain	167	174	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ouabain"", ""start_span"": 167, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Though this fall would be associated with a decrease in wall tension, and, therefore, of myocardial oxygen consumption, it may not be of sufficient magnitude to prevent a net increase in myocardial oxygen consumption.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether glucocorticoid treatment can directly affect the outflow facility of isolated, perfusion - cultured human eyes.	[]
METHODS: The anterior segments of human donor eyes from regional eye banks were placed in a constant flow, variable pressure perfusion culture system.	[]

Eleven homosexual men with advanced Kaposi ' s sarcoma were entered in the trial.	[]
Changes in size, colour and associated oedema of selected ' target ' lesions were measured.	[]
Clinical, biochemical and haematological toxicities were assessed.	[]
Ten subjects were evaluated.	[]
A partial response was achieved in four, of whom two subsequently relapsed.	[]
Stabilization of Kaposi ' s sarcoma occurred in the remaining six, maintained until the end of the trial period in four.	[]
The drug was generally well tolerated, with few mild symptoms of toxicity.	[]
The main problem encountered was haematological toxicity, with three subjects experiencing severe neutropenia ( neutrophil count < 0. 5 x 10 ( 9) / l).	[]
There was no evidence of cardiotoxicity.	[]
In this small patient sample, liposomal daunorubicin was an effective and well tolerated agent in the treatment of Kaposi ' s sarcoma.	"daunorubicin	40	52	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""daunorubicin"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

The patients were interviewed with emphasis on neuropathic symptoms.	[]
Physical and quantitative sensory examination with determination of vibratory perception and thermal discrimination thresholds were performed, four to 77 months ( median 34 months) after vincristine treatment.	"vincristine	187	198	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""vincristine"", ""start_span"": 187, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Twenty - seven patients reported neuropathic symptoms.	[]
In 13 of these 27 patients symptoms were still present at the time of examination.	[]
In these patients sensory signs and symptoms predominated.	[]
In the other 14 patients symptoms had been present in the past.	[]
Symptoms persisted maximally 40 months since cessation of therapy.	[]
There was no age difference between patients with and without complaints at the time of examination.	[]
Normal reflexes were found in two third of patients.	[]
Neuropathic complaints were not very troublesome on the long term.	[]
It is concluded that with the above mentioned vincristine dose schedule signs and symptoms of vincristine neuropathy are reversible for a great deal and prognosis is fairly good.

Sprague - Dawley rats were injected intraperitoneally with pilocarpine, and the hippocampal formation was studied histologically at 1, 2, 4, and 8 week intervals after pilocarpine - induced seizures.

In situ hybridization histochemistry, using a digoxigenin - labeled GAD cRNA probe, demonstrated a substantial decrease in the number of GAD mRNA - containing neurons in the hilus of the dentate gyrus in the pilocarpine - treated rats as compared to controls at all time intervals.	"digoxigenin	46	57	Chemical/Drug"	"pilocarpine	208	219	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""digoxigenin"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""pilocarpine"", ""start_span"": 208, ""end_span"": 219, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Additional neuronanatomical studies, including cresyl violet staining, neuronal degeneration methods, and histochemical localization of glial fibrillary acidic protein, suggested that the decrease in the number of GAD mRNA - containing neurons was related to neuronal loss rather than to a decrease in GAD mRNA levels.	"cresyl violet	47	60	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cresyl violet"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The loss of GAD mRNA - containing neurons in the hilus contrasted with the relative preservation of labeled putative basket cells along the inner margin of the granule cell layer.	[]
Quantitative analyses of labeled neurons in three regions of the dentate gyrus in the 1 and 2 week groups showed statistically significant decreases in the mean number of GAD mRNA - containing neurons in the hilus of both groups of experimental animals.	[]
No significant differences were found in the molecular layer or the granule cell layer, which included labeled neurons along the lower margin of the granule cell layer.	[]
The results indicate that, in this model, a subpopulation of GAD mRNA - containing neurons within the dentate gyrus is selectively vulnerable to seizure - induced damage.	[]
Such differential vulnerability appears to be another indication of the heterogeneity of GABA neurons.	"GABA	89	93	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""GABA"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

The effect of deliberate hypotension on brain function measured by neuropsychological tests was studied in 41 adult patients.	[]
Twenty - four patients were anaesthetized for middle - ear surgery with deliberate hypotension induced by labetalol with isoflurane ( hypotensive group).

Seventeen patients without hypotension served as a control group.	[]
The mean arterial pressure was 77 + / - 2 mmHg ( 10. 3 + / - 0. 3 kPa) before hypotension and 50 + / - 0 mmHg ( 6. 7 + / - 0. 0 kPa) during hypotension in the hypotensive group, and 86 + / - 2 mmHg ( 11. 5 + / - 0. 3 kPa) during anaesthesia in the control group.	[]
The following psychological tests were performed: four subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale ( similarities, digit span, vocabulary and digit symbol), Trail - Making tests A and B, Zung tests ( self - rating anxiety scale and self - rating depression scale) and two - part memory test battery with immediate and delayed recall.	[]
The tests were performed preoperatively and 2 days postoperatively.	[]
There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in any of the tests in the changes from preoperative value to postoperative value.	[]
The results indicate that hypotension induced by labetalol with isoflurane has no significant harmful effects on mental functions compared to normotensive anaesthesia.

Apparent cure of rheumatoid arthritis by bone marrow transplantation.	[]
We describe the induction of sustained remissions and possible cure of severe erosive rheumatoid arthritis ( RA) by bone marrow transplantation ( BMT) in 2 patients.	[]
BMT was used to treat severe aplastic anemia which was caused by gold in one case and D - penicillamine in the other.

In the 8 and 6 years since the transplants ( representing 8 and 4 years since cessation of all immunosuppressive therapy, respectively), the RA in each case has been completely quiescent.	[]
Although short term remission of severe RA following BMT has been reported, these are the first cases for which prolonged followup has been available.	[]
This experience raises the question of the role of BMT itself as a therapeutic option for patients with uncontrolled destructive synovitis.	[]

At the 16th week of carcinogen feeding, hyperplastic nodules appeared and advanced to further stages.	[]
A majority of the nodules showed a considerable number of peroxisomes and the inductive proliferation of peroxisomes.	[]
Within the nodules, foci of proliferation of the cells that showed no inducibility of proliferation of peroxisomes appeared.	[]
These cells proliferated further, replacing the most part of the nodules, and with this process hepatomas appeared to have been formed.	[]
No abnormal matrical inclusions of peroxisomes were formed in the cells of hyperplastic nodules by ethyl - alpha - p - chlorophenoxyisobutyrate unlike in the case of rats.

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that, in lifetime captopril - treated spontaneously hypertensive rats ( SHR), the sympathetic nervous system contributes importantly to the hypertensive effect of dietary sodium chloride supplementation.	"captopril	52	61	Chemical/Drug"	"dietary sodium chloride	197	220	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""captopril"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""dietary sodium chloride"", ""start_span"": 197, ""end_span"": 220, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METHODS: Male SHR ( aged 6 weeks) that had been treated from conception onward with either captopril or vehicle remained on a basal sodium chloride diet or were fed a high sodium chloride diet.

After 2 weeks, the rats were subjected to ganglionic blockade and 2 days later, an infusion of clonidine.	"clonidine	95	104	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""clonidine"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
RESULTS: Lifetime captopril treatment significantly lowered mean arterial pressure in both groups.	"captopril	18	27	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""captopril"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Intravenous infusion of the ganglionic blocker hexamethonium resulted in a rapid decline in MAP that eliminated the dietary sodium chloride - induced increase in MAP in both groups.

Late cardiotoxicity after treatment for a malignant bone tumor.	[]
Cardiac function was assessed in long - term survivors of malignant bone tumors who were treated according to Rosen ' s T5 or T10 protocol, both including doxorubicin.

Thirty - one patients, age 10 - 45 years ( median age 17. 8 years) were evaluated 2. 3 - 14. 1 years ( median 8. 9 years) following completion of treatment.	[]
Cumulative doses of doxorubicin were 225 - 550 mg / m2 ( median dose 360).	"doxorubicin	20	31	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""doxorubicin"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The evaluation consisted of a history, physical examination, electrocardiogram ( ECG), signal averaged ECG, 24 - hour ambulatory ECG, echocardiography and radionuclide angiography.	[]
Eighteen of 31 ( 58%) patients showed cardiac toxicity, defined as having one or more of the following abnormalities: late potentials, complex ventricular arrhythmias, left ventricular dilation, decreased shortening fraction, or decreased ejection fraction.	[]
The incidence of cardiac abnormalities increased with length of follow - up ( P < or =. 05).	[]
No correlation could be demonstrated between cumulative dose of doxorubicin and cardiac status, except for heart rate variability.	"doxorubicin	64	75	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""doxorubicin"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
When adjusted to body surface area, the left ventricular posterior wall thickness ( LVPW index) was decreased in all patients.	[]
The incidence of doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity is high and increases with follow - up, irrespective of cumulative dose.	"doxorubicin	17	28	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""doxorubicin"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Life - long cardiac follow - up in these patients is warranted.	[]
The results of our study suggest that heart rate variability and LVPW index could be sensitive indicators for cardiotoxicity.	[]
Acute blood pressure elevations with caffeine in men with borderline systemic hypertension.	"caffeine	37	45	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""caffeine"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Whether the vasoconstrictive actions of caffeine are enhanced in hypertensive persons has not been demonstrated.	"caffeine	40	48	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""caffeine"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Thus, caffeine ( 3. 3 mg / kg) versus placebo was tested in 48 healthy men ( aged 20 to 35 years) selected after screening on 2 separate occasions.	"caffeine	6	14	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""caffeine"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Borderline hypertensive men ( n = 24) were selected with screening systolic blood pressure ( BP) of 140 to 160 mm Hg and / or diastolic BP 90 to 99 mm Hg.	[]
Low - risk controls ( n = 24) reported no parental history of hypertension and had screening BP < 130 / 85 mm Hg.	[]
Participants were then tested on 2 occasions after 12 - hour abstinence from caffeine in each of 2 protocols; this required a total of 4 laboratory visits.	"caffeine	77	85	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""caffeine"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Caffeine - induced changes in diastolic BP were 2 to 3 times larger in borderline subjects than in controls ( + 8. 4 vs + 3. 8 mm Hg, p < 0. 0001), and were attributable to larger changes in impedance - derived measures of systemic vascular resistance ( + 135 vs + 45 dynes. s. cm - 5, p < 0. 004).	"Caffeine	0	8	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Caffeine"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
These findings were consistent and reached significance in both protocols.	[]
The percentage of borderline subjects in whom diastolic BP changes exceeded the median control response was 96%.	[]
Consequently, whereas all participants exhibited normotensive levels during the resting predrug baseline, 33% of borderline subjects achieved hypertensive BP levels after caffeine ingestion.	"caffeine	171	179	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""caffeine"", ""start_span"": 171, ""end_span"": 179, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Thus, in borderline hypertensive men, exaggerated responses to caffeine were: selective for diastolic BP, consistent with greater vasoconstriction, replicated in 2 protocols, and representative of nearly all borderline hypertensives.	"caffeine	63	71	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""caffeine"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We suspect that the potential for caffeine to stabilize high resistance states in susceptible persons suggests that its use may facilitate their disease progression, as well as hinder accurate diagnosis and treatment.

Diabetes mellitus ( DM) was found during admission.	[]
Computed tomography showed a hemorrhagic infarct in the right frontal lobe and increased density in the superior sagittal sinus ( SSS).	[]

Right carotid angiograms failed to show the SSS and inferior sagittal sinus, suggestive of venous sinus thrombosis.	[]
Coexistence of the cerebral artery and the venous sinus occlusion has been described infrequently.	[]
In this case, the authors postulate that the use of estradiol and progesterone and the underlying DM increased vascular thrombogenicity, which provided a common denominator for thrombosis of both the ICA and the venous sinus.

Leukopenia was dose limiting: as many as 62. 5% of patients experienced grade 4 leukopenia.	[]
We investigated the efficacy and toxicity of a 3 - hour paclitaxel infusion in a phase II trial in patients with inoperable stage IIIB or IV NSCLC.	"paclitaxel	56	66	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""paclitaxel"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The 58 patients treated ( 41 men and 17 women) had a median age of 59 years ( age range, 25 to 75) and a performance status of 0 through 2.	[]
Most patients ( 72. 4%) had stage IV NSCLC.	[]

Of 50 patients evaluable for response, 12 ( 24%) had partial remission, 26 ( 52%) had no change, and 12 had disease progression ( 24%).	[]
Hematologic toxicities were mild: only one patient ( 2%) developed grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, while 29% had grade 1 or 2.	[]
Grade 1 or 2 polyneuropathy affected 56% of patients while only one ( 2%) experienced severe polyneuropathy.	[]
Similarly, grade 1 or 2 myalgia / arthralgia was observed in 63. 2% of patients, but only 14. 3% experienced grade 3 or 4.	[]
Nausea and vomiting were infrequent, with 14% of patients experiencing grade 1 or 2 and only 2% experiencing grade 3 or 4.	[]
Paclitaxel is thus an active single agent in this patient population, with a 3 - hour infusion proving comparably effective to a 24 - hour infusion and superior in terms of the incidence of hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity.

To date, 30 previously untreated patients, all with a good performance status ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0 to 2) have been entered into this ongoing study.	[]
The dose - limiting toxicity of the combination was myelosuppression ( leukopenia, granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia).	[]
Neurotoxicity was largely moderate.	[]
So far, 14 patients are evaluable for response; of these, eight ( 57%) showed objective ( complete or partial) response and disease stabilized in six patients.	[]
No patient had disease progression.	[]
We conclude that the combination of paclitaxel 185 mg / m2 administered as a 3 - hour infusion followed immediately by a 1 - hour infusion of carboplatin at an AUC of 6 can be administered safely in a 21 - day schedule in the outpatient setting.

Maximal twitches of the diaphragm were lower in the C group ( 653 + / - 174 g / cm ( 2)) than in the M group ( 837 + / - 171 g / cm ( 2); p < 0. 05) and the T group ( 765 + / - 145 g / cm ( 2), NS).

ATPase staining of the diaphragm, scalenus medius, and gastrocnemius showed type IIb fiber atrophy in the steroid groups and also diaphragmatic type IIa atrophy with T, whereas histologic examinations revealed a normal muscular pattern with absence of necrosis.

We conclude that ( 1) short - term treatment with massive doses of steroids induced severe respiratory and limb muscle wasting; ( 2) both types of steroids induced predominantly type IIb atrophy, resulting in the expected alterations in diaphragm contractile properties; ( 3) neither steroid caused muscle necrosis; ( 4) type IIb atrophy was not caused by acute nutritional deprivation alone.

In addition, subcutaneous delivery of the neutralizing agent will not be associated with the risk of inadequate urinary mesna concentrations, such as in a patient taking oral mesna who experiences severe ifosfamide - induced emesis and is unable to absorb the drug.

Ethinyl estradiol - treated animals excreted significantly less 14C as taurocholic acid than did control animals, consistent with an impairment of 7alpha - hydroxylation of taurodeoxycholic acid.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the antihypertensive efficacy of a new angiotensin II antagonist, valsartan, with a reference therapy, amlodipine.	"angiotensin II	61	75	Chemical/Drug"	"valsartan	88	97	Chemical/Drug"	"amlodipine	125	135	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""angiotensin II"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""valsartan"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""amlodipine"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METHODS: One hundred sixty - eight adult outpatients with mild to moderate hypertension were randomly allocated in double - blind fashion and equal number to receive 80 mg valsartan or 5 mg amlodipine for 12 weeks.	"valsartan	172	181	Chemical/Drug"	"amlodipine	190	200	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""valsartan"", ""start_span"": 172, ""end_span"": 181, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""amlodipine"", ""start_span"": 190, ""end_span"": 200, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
After 8 weeks of therapy, in patients whose blood pressure remained uncontrolled, 5 mg amlodipine was added to the initial therapy.	"amlodipine	87	97	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""amlodipine"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Patients were assessed at 4, 8, and 12 weeks.	[]
The primary efficacy variable was change from baseline in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure at 8 weeks.	[]
Secondary variables included change in sitting systolic blood pressure and responder rates.	[]
RESULTS: Both valsartan and amlodipine were effective at lowering blood pressure at 4, 8, and 12 weeks.

Similar decreases were observed in both groups, with no statistically significant differences between the groups for any variable analyzed.	[]
For the primary variable the difference was 0. 5 mm Hg in favor of valsartan ( p = 0. 68; 95% confidence interval, - 2. 7 to 1. 7).	"valsartan	67	76	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""valsartan"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Responder rates at 8 weeks were 66. 7% for valsartan and 60. 2% for amlodipine ( p = 0. 39).

Both treatments were well tolerated.	[]
The incidence of drug - related dependent edema was somewhat higher in the amlodipine group, particularly at a dose of 10 mg per day ( 2. 4% for 80 mg valsartan; 3. 6% for 5 mg amlodipine; 0% for valsartan plus 5 mg amlodipine; 14. 3% for 10 mg amlodipine).

Extensive experimental and limited clinical data have shown that lometrexol has activity against tumours which are refractory to other drugs, notably methotrexate.

However, the initial clinical development of lometrexol was curtailed because of severe and cumulative antiproliferative toxicities.	"lometrexol	45	55	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""lometrexol"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Preclinical murine studies demonstrated that the toxicity of lometrexol can be prevented by low dose folic acid administration, i. e. for 7 days prior to and 7 days following a single bolus dose.

Compared with controls, EDDs were more frequently black, male, and younger.	[]
They were less likely to have a low body mass index, and more likely to have died in police custody, to have received medical treatment immediately before death, to have survived for a longer period, to have developed hyperthermia, and to have died in summer months.	[]
EDDs had concentrations of cocaine and benzoylecgonine in autopsy blood that were similar to those for controls.

Although the neuroactive steroids were considerably less potent than the benzodiazepine clonazepam in protecting against pilocarpine seizures, steroids with the 5 alpha, 3 alpha - configuration had comparable or higher protective index values ( TD50 for motor impairment divided by ED50 for seizure protection) than clonazepam, indicating that some neuroactive steroids may have lower relative toxicity.

Steroids with the 5 alpha, 3 alpha - or 5 beta, 3 alpha - configurations also produced a dose - dependent delay in the onset of limbic seizures induced by kainic acid ( 32 mg / kg, s. c.), but did not completely protect against the seizures.

However, when a second dose of the steroid was administered 1 hr after the first dose, complete protection from the kainic acid - induced limbic seizures and status epilepticus was obtained.

The steroids also caused a dose - dependent delay in NMDA ( 257 mg / kg, s. c.) - induced lethality, but did not completely protect against NMDA seizures or lethality.

The expression of VEGF receptor ( VEGFR - 2 / Flk - 1 / KDR) was also examined by immunohistochemistry.	[]

Neuropeptide - Y ( NPY) is expressed by granule cells and mossy fibres of the hippocampal dentate gyrus during experimental temporal lobe epilepsy ( TLE).	[]
This expression may represent an endogenous damping mechanism since NPY has been shown to block seizure - like events following high - frequency stimulation in hippocampal slices.	[]
The pilocarpine ( PILO) model of epilepsy is characterized by an acute period of status epilepticus followed by spontaneous recurrent seizures and related brain damage.

Posteroventral medial pallidotomy in advanced Parkinson ' s disease.	[]
BACKGROUND: Posteroventral medial pallidotomy sometimes produces striking improvement in patients with advanced Parkinson ' s disease, but the studies to date have involved small numbers of patients and short - term follow - up.	[]
"METHODS: Forty patients with Parkinson ' s disease underwent serial, detailed assessments both after drug withdrawal ( "" off "" period) and while taking their optimal medical regimens ( "" on "" period)."	[]
All patients were examined preoperatively and 39 were examined at six months; 27 of the patients were also examined at one year, and 11 at two years.	[]
RESULTS: The percent improvements at six months were as follows: off - period score for overall motor function, 28 percent ( 95 percent confidence interval, 19 to 38 percent), with most of the improvement in the contralateral limbs; off - period score for activities of daily living, 29 percent ( 95 percent confidence interval, 19 to 39 percent); on - period score for contralateral dyskinesias, 82 percent ( 95 percent confidence interval, 72 to 91 percent); and on - period score for ipsilateral dyskinesias, 44 percent ( 95 percent confidence interval, 29 to 59 percent).	[]
The improvements in dyskinesias and the total scores for off - period parkinsonism, contralateral bradykinesia, and rigidity were sustained in the 11 patients examined at two years.	[]
The improvement in ipsilateral dyskinesias was lost after one year, and the improvements in postural stability and gait lasted only three to six months.	[]
Approximately half the patients who had been dependent on assistance in activities of daily living in the off period before surgery became independent after surgery.	[]
The complications of surgery were generally well tolerated, and there were no significant changes in the use of medication.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: In late - stage Parkinson ' s disease, pallidotomy significantly reduces levodopa - induced dyskinesias and off - period disability.	"levodopa	86	94	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""levodopa"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Much of the benefit is sustained at two years, although some improvements, such as those on the ipsilateral side and in axial symptoms, wane within the first year.	[]
The on - period symptoms that are resistant to dopaminergic therapy do not respond to pallidotomy.	[]

RESULTS: Prostigmine - morphine provocation caused significant increases in the time to peak activity ( Tmax) over the hepatic hilum ( HH: 34. 33 + / - 5. 05 vs. 22. 77 + / - 3. 26) and the common bile duct ( CBD: 60. 44 + / - 5. 99 vs. 40. 0 + / - 2. 88) and in the half - time of excretion ( T1 / 2) over the liver parenchyma ( LP: 120. 04 + / - 16. 01 vs. 27. 37 + / - 2. 19), HH ( 117. 61 + / - 14. 71 vs. 31. 85 + / - 3. 99) and CBD ( 158. 11 + / - 9. 18 vs. 40. 1 + / - 6. 24), indicating a complete spasm at the level of the sphincter of Oddi.

Light microscopy of renal biopsy samples showed minimal glomerular capillary wall thickening and mesangial matrix increase, or no departure from normal.	[]
Electron microscopy, however, revealed subepithelial electron - dense deposits, fusion of epithelial cell foot processes, and evidence of mesangial cell hyperactivity.	[]
Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated granular capillary wall deposits of IgG and C3.	[]
The findings were similar to those in early membranous glomerulonephritis, differences being observed however in the results of staining for the early - acting complement components C1q and C4.	[]

Using a positron emission tomography ( PET) study it was shown recently that in migraine without aura certain areas in the brain stem were activated during the headache state, but not in the headache free interval.	[]
It was suggested that this brain stem activation is inherent to the migraine attack itself and represents the so called ' migraine generator '.	[]
To test this hypothesis we performed an experimental pain study in seven healthy volunteers, using the same positioning in the PET scanner as in the migraine patients.	[]
A small amount of capsaicin was administered subcutaneously in the right forehead to evoke a burning painful sensation in the first division of the trigeminal nerve.	"capsaicin	18	27	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""capsaicin"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Increases of regional cerebral blood flow ( rCBF) were found bilaterally in the insula, in the anterior cingulate cortex, the cavernous sinus and the cerebellum.	[]
Using the same stereotactic space limits as in the above mentioned migraine study no brain stem activation was found in the acute pain state compared to the pain free state.	[]
The increase of activation in the region of the cavernous sinus however, suggests that this structure is more likely to be involved in trigeminal transmitted pain as such, rather than in a specific type of headache as was suggested for cluster headache.	[]

Sixty - five patients, 34 women and 31 men, ages 36 to 80 years, received either normal saline before and after TDI ( group 1), 125 mg i. v. MP before and saline after TDI ( group 2), or 125 mg i. v.

Patients were observed for 72 hours and reactions were recorded and graded according to severity.	[]
Fifty - eight percent of group 1 patients, 33% of group 2, and 26% of group 3 had reactions to TDI.	[]
The severity of reactions ( minimal, mild, and moderate, respectively) was as follows: group 1 - - 6, 6, and 2; group 2 - - 1, 5, and 0; group 3 - - 5, 1, and 0.	[]
Data were analyzed by the two - sided Fisher ' s exact test using 95% confidence intervals with the approximation of Woolf.	[]
These data demonstrate that administration of MP before and after TDI reduces the frequency and severity of the arthralgia - myalgia syndrome.	"MP	46	48	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""MP"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

These results are compatible with the hypothesis that an hyperkinetic abnormal involuntary movement, like L - dopa - induced peak dose dyskinesia, is due to a disinhibition of the primary and associated motor cortex secondary to an excessive outflow of the pallidothalamocortical motor loop.

BACKGROUND: The most striking of carboplatin ' s advantages ( CBDCA) over cisplatin ( CDDP) is its markedly reduced rate of neurotoxic effects.	"carboplatin	33	44	Chemical/Drug"	"CBDCA	62	67	Chemical/Drug"	"cisplatin	74	83	Chemical/Drug"	"CDDP	86	90	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""carboplatin"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""CBDCA"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""cisplatin"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""CDDP"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
However, the use of CBDCA higher - intensity schedules and the association with other neurotoxic drugs in polychemotherapy may cause some concern about its safety with respect to peripheral nervous system damage.	"CBDCA	20	25	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""CBDCA"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two different schedules of CBDCA administration ( 10 mg / kg and 15 mg / kg i. p. twice a week for nine times) were evaluated in Wistar rats.	"CBDCA	50	55	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""CBDCA"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Neurotoxicity was assessed for behavioral ( tail - flick test), neurophysiological ( nerve conduction velocity in the tail nerve), morphological, morphometrical and analytical effects.	[]
RESULTS: CBDCA administration induced dose - dependent peripheral neurotoxicity.	"CBDCA	9	14	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""CBDCA"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Pain perception and nerve conduction velocity in the tail were significantly impaired, particularly after the high - dose treatment.	[]
The dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons and, to a lesser extent, satellite cells showed the same changes as those induced by CDDP, mainly affecting the nucleus and nucleolus of ganglionic sensory neurons.	"CDDP	125	129	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""CDDP"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Moreover, significant amounts of platinum were detected in the dorsal root ganglia and kidney after CBDCA treatment.

CONCLUSIONS: CBDCA is neurotoxic in our model, and the type of pathological changes it induces are so closely similar to those caused by CDDP that it is probable that neurotoxicity is induced in the two drugs by the same mechanism.

METHODS: In October, 1992, we started a double - blind placebo - controlled, randomised trial of tamoxifen in women ( mainly in Italy) who did not have breast cancer and who had had a hysterectomy.	"tamoxifen	97	106	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""tamoxifen"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Women were randomised to receive tamoxifen 20 mg per day or placebo, both orally for 5 years.	"tamoxifen	33	42	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""tamoxifen"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The original plan was to follow the intervention phase by 5 years ' follow - up.	[]
In June, 1997, the trialists and the data - monitoring committee decided to end recruitment primarily because of the number of women dropping out of the study.	[]
Recruitment ended on July 11, 1997, and the study will continue as planned.	[]
The primary endpoints are the occurrence of and deaths from breast cancer.	[]
This preliminary interim analysis is based on intention - to - treat.	[]
FINDINGS: 5408 women were randomised; participating women have a median follow - up of 46 months for major endpoints.	[]
41 cases of breast cancer occurred so far; there have been no deaths from breast cancer.	[]
There is no difference in breast - cancer frequency between the placebo ( 22 cases) and tamoxifen ( 19) arms.	"tamoxifen	88	97	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""tamoxifen"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
There is a statistically significant reduction of breast cancer among women receiving tamoxifen who also used hormone - replacement therapy during the trial: among 390 women on such therapy and allocated to placebo, we found eight cases of breast cancer compared with one case among 362 women allocated to tamoxifen.

The experiment was terminated 3 weeks after the ninth dosing.	[]
Animals which received over six courses of doxorubicin demonstrated the electrocardiogram ( ECG) changes, decrease of blood pressure and high - grade histopathological cardiomyopathy, while animals which were terminally sacrificed after the SM - 5887 administration did not show any changes in ECG, blood pressure and histopathological examinations.

Nine weeks after pre - treatment, dogs were given four courses of either doxorubicin ( 1. 5 mg / kg) or SM - 5887 ( 2. 5 mg / kg) once every 3 weeks.	"doxorubicin	73	84	Chemical/Drug"	"SM - 5887	104	113	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""doxorubicin"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""SM - 5887"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The low - grade cardiotoxic changes were enhanced by the additional doxorubicin treatment.	"doxorubicin	68	79	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""doxorubicin"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
On the contrary, the SM - 5887 treatment did not progress the grade of cardiomyopathy.	"SM - 5887	21	30	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""SM - 5887"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

BACKGROUND: Because uncontrolled echocardiographic surveys suggested that up to 30% to 38% of users of fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine had valvular disease, these drugs were withdrawn from the market.	"fenfluramine	103	115	Chemical/Drug"	"dexfenfluramine	120	135	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""fenfluramine"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""dexfenfluramine"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk for new or worsening valvular abnormalities among users of fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine who underwent echocardiography before they began to take these medications.

DESIGN: Cohort study.	[]
SETTING: Academic primary care practices.	[]
PATIENTS: 46 patients who used fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for 14 days or more and had echocardiograms obtained before therapy.	"fenfluramine	31	43	Chemical/Drug"	"dexfenfluramine	47	62	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""fenfluramine"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""dexfenfluramine"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
MEASUREMENTS: Follow - up echocardiography.	[]
The primary outcome was new or worsening valvulopathy, defined as progression of either aortic or mitral regurgitation by at least one degree of severity and disease that met U. S.	[]
Food and Drug Administration criteria ( at least mild aortic regurgitation or moderate mitral regurgitation).	[]
RESULTS: Two patients ( 4. 3% [ 95% CI, 0. 6% to 14. 8%]) receiving fenfluramine - phentermine developed valvular heart disease.	"fenfluramine	68	80	Chemical/Drug"	"phentermine	83	94	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""fenfluramine"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""phentermine"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
One had baseline bicuspid aortic valve and mild aortic regurgitation that progressed to moderate regurgitation.	[]
The second patient developed new moderate aortic insufficiency.	[]
CONCLUSION: Users of diet medications are at risk for valvular heart disease.	[]
However, the incidence may be lower than that reported previously.	[]
Therapeutic drug monitoring of tobramycin: once - daily versus twice - daily dosage schedules.	"tobramycin	31	41	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""tobramycin"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of dosage regimen ( once - daily vs. twice - daily) of tobramicyn on steady - state serum concentrations and toxicity.	"tobramicyn	89	99	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""tobramicyn"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients undergoing treatment with i. v. tobramycin ( 4 mg / kg / day) were randomised to two groups.	"tobramycin	64	74	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""tobramycin"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Group OD ( n = 22) received a once - daily dose of tobramycin and group TD ( n = 21) received the same dose divided into two doses daily.	"tobramycin	51	61	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""tobramycin"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Tobramycin serum concentrations ( peak and trough) were measured by enzyme multiplied immunoassay.	"Tobramycin	0	10	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Tobramycin"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The renal and auditory functions of the patients were monitored before, during and immediately after treatment.	[]
RESULTS: The two groups were comparable with respect to sex, age, body weight and renal function.	[]
No statistically significant differences were found in mean daily dose, duration of treatment, or cumulative dose.	[]
Trough concentrations were < 2 g / ml in the two groups ( 100%).	[]
Peak concentrations were > 6 microg / ml in 100% of the OD group and in 67% of the TD group ( P < 0. 01).	[]
Mean peak concentrations were markedly different: 11. 00 + / - 2. 89 microg / ml in OD vs. 6. 53 + / - 1. 45 microg / ml in TD ( P < 0. 01).	[]
The pharmacokinetics parameters were: Ke, ( 0. 15 + / - 0. 03 / h in OD vs. 0. 24 + / - 0. 06 / h in TD), t1 / 2, ( 4. 95 + / - 1. 41 h in OD vs. 3. 07 + / - 0. 71 h in TD), Vd ( 0. 35 + / - 0. 11 l / kg in OD vs. 0. 33 + / - 0. 09 l / kg in TD), Cl ( 0. 86 + / - 0. 29 ml / min / kg in OD vs. 1. 28 + / - 0. 33 ml / min / kg in TD).	[]
Increased serum creatinine was observed in 73% of patients in OD versus 57% of patients in TD, without evidence of nephrotoxicity.	"creatinine	16	26	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""creatinine"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In TD group, three patients developed decreased auditory function, of which one presented with an auditory loss of - 30 dB, whereas in the OD group only one patient presented decreased auditory function.	[]
CONCLUSION: This small study suggests that a once - daily dosing regimen of tobramycin is at least as effective as and is no more and possibly less toxic than the twice - daily regimen.	"tobramycin	76	86	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""tobramycin"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Using a single - dose therapy, peak concentration determination is not necessary, only trough samples should be monitored to ensure levels below 2 microg / ml.	[]
Enhanced bradycardia induced by beta - adrenoceptor antagonists in rats pretreated with isoniazid.	"isoniazid	88	97	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""isoniazid"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
High doses of isoniazid increase hypotension induced by vasodilators and change the accompanying reflex tachycardia to bradycardia, an interaction attributed to decreased synthesis of brain gamma - aminobutyric acid ( GABA).	"isoniazid	14	23	Chemical/Drug"	"gamma - aminobutyric acid	190	215	Chemical/Drug"	"GABA	218	222	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""isoniazid"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""gamma - aminobutyric acid"", ""start_span"": 190, ""end_span"": 215, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""GABA"", ""start_span"": 218, ""end_span"": 222, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In the present study, the possible enhancement by isoniazid of bradycardia induced by beta - adrenoceptor antagonists was determined in rats anaesthetised with chloralose - urethane.	"isoniazid	50	59	Chemical/Drug"	"chloralose	160	170	Chemical/Drug"	"urethane	173	181	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""isoniazid"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""chloralose"", ""start_span"": 160, ""end_span"": 170, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""urethane"", ""start_span"": 173, ""end_span"": 181, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Isoniazid significantly increased bradycardia after propranolol, pindolol, labetalol and atenolol, as well as after clonidine, but not after hexamethonium or carbachol.

Enhancement was not observed in rats pretreated with methylatropine or previously vagotomised.	"methylatropine	53	67	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""methylatropine"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
These results are compatible with interference by isoniazid with GABAergic inhibition of cardiac parasympathetic tone.	"isoniazid	50	59	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""isoniazid"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Such interference could be exerted centrally, possibly at the nucleus ambiguus, or peripherally at the sinus node.	[]
Structural and functional impairment of mitochondria in adriamycin - induced cardiomyopathy in mice: suppression of cytochrome c oxidase II gene expression.	"adriamycin	56	66	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""adriamycin"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The use of adriamycin ( ADR) in cancer chemotherapy has been limited due to its cumulative cardiovascular toxicity.	"adriamycin	11	21	Chemical/Drug"	"ADR	24	27	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""adriamycin"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""ADR"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Earlier observations that ADR interacts with mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase ( COX) and suppresses its enzyme activity led us to investigate ADR ' s action on the cardiovascular functions and heart mitochondrial morphology in Balb - c mice i. p. treated with ADR for several weeks.	"ADR	26	29	Chemical/Drug"	"ADR	26	29	Chemical/Drug"	"ADR	26	29	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ADR"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""ADR"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""ADR"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
At various times during treatment, the animals were assessed for cardiovascular functions by electrocardiography and for heart tissue damage by electron microscopy.	[]
In parallel, total RNA was extracted from samples of dissected heart and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization to determine the steady - state level of three RNA transcripts encoded by the COXII, COXIII, and COXIV genes.	[]
Similarly, samples obtained from the liver of the same animals were analyzed for comparative studies.	[]
Our results indicated that 1) treatment of mice with ADR caused cardiovascular arrhythmias characterized by bradycardia, extension of ventricular depolarization time ( tQRS), and failure of QRS at high concentrations ( 10 - 14 mg / kg body weight cumulative dose); 2) the heart mitochondria underwent swelling, fusion, dissolution, and / or disruption of mitochondrial cristae after several weeks of treatment.	"ADR	53	56	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ADR"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Such abnormalities were not observed in the mitochondria of liver tissue; and 3) among the three genes of COX enzyme examined, only COXII gene expression was suppressed by ADR treatment, mainly after 8 weeks in both heart and liver.	"ADR	172	175	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ADR"", ""start_span"": 172, ""end_span"": 175, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Knowing that heart mitochondria represent almost 40% of heart muscle by weight, we conclude that the deteriorating effects of ADR on cardiovascular function involve mitochondrial structural and functional impairment.
