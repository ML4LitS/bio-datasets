The subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol ( 30 mg / kg) into rats twice at an interval of 24 h, for two consecutive days, led to a significant increase in serum lactate dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and angiotensin - converting enzyme activities, total cholesterol, triglycerides, free serum fatty acid, cardiac tissue malondialdehyde ( MDA), and nitric oxide levels and a significant decrease in levels of glutathione and superoxide dismutase in cardiac tissue as compared to the normal control group ( P < 0. 05).	isoproterenol,30,43,Chemical/Drug	lactate,163,170,Chemical/Drug	creatine,186,194,Chemical/Drug	alanine,210,217,Chemical/Drug	aspartate,232,241,Chemical/Drug	angiotensin,260,271,Chemical/Drug	cholesterol,310,321,Chemical/Drug	triglycerides,323,336,Chemical/Drug	fatty acid,349,359,Chemical/Drug	malondialdehyde,376,391,Chemical/Drug	MDA,394,397,Chemical/Drug	nitric oxide,404,416,Chemical/Drug	glutathione,464,475,Chemical/Drug	superoxide,480,490,Chemical/Drug	"[{""token"": ""isoproterenol"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""lactate"", ""start_span"": 163, ""end_span"": 170, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""creatine"", ""start_span"": 186, ""end_span"": 194, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""alanine"", ""start_span"": 210, ""end_span"": 217, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""aspartate"", ""start_span"": 232, ""end_span"": 241, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""angiotensin"", ""start_span"": 260, ""end_span"": 271, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""cholesterol"", ""start_span"": 310, ""end_span"": 321, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""triglycerides"", ""start_span"": 323, ""end_span"": 336, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""fatty acid"", ""start_span"": 349, ""end_span"": 359, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""malondialdehyde"", ""start_span"": 376, ""end_span"": 391, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""MDA"", ""start_span"": 394, ""end_span"": 397, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""nitric oxide"", ""start_span"": 404, ""end_span"": 416, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""glutathione"", ""start_span"": 464, ""end_span"": 475, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""superoxide"", ""start_span"": 480, ""end_span"": 490, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"	test
