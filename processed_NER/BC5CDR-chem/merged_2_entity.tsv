In the chronic treatment, beagle dogs of each sex were given intravenously once every 3 weeks, either a sublethal dose of doxorubicin ( 1. 5 mg / kg) or SM - 5887 ( 2. 5 mg / kg).	doxorubicin,122,133,Chemical/Drug	SM - 5887,153,162,Chemical/Drug	"[{""token"": ""doxorubicin"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""SM - 5887"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 162, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"	train
Animals which received over six courses of doxorubicin demonstrated the electrocardiogram ( ECG) changes, decrease of blood pressure and high - grade histopathological cardiomyopathy, while animals which were terminally sacrificed after the SM - 5887 administration did not show any changes in ECG, blood pressure and histopathological examinations.	doxorubicin,43,54,Chemical/Drug	SM - 5887,241,250,Chemical/Drug	"[{""token"": ""doxorubicin"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""SM - 5887"", ""start_span"": 241, ""end_span"": 250, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"	train
To examine a possibly deteriorating cardiotoxic effect of SM - 5887, low - grade cardiomyopathy was induced in dogs by four courses of doxorubicin ( 1. 5 mg / kg).

Nine weeks after pre - treatment, dogs were given four courses of either doxorubicin ( 1. 5 mg / kg) or SM - 5887 ( 2. 5 mg / kg) once every 3 weeks.	doxorubicin,73,84,Chemical/Drug	SM - 5887,104,113,Chemical/Drug	"[{""token"": ""doxorubicin"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""SM - 5887"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"	train

BACKGROUND: Because uncontrolled echocardiographic surveys suggested that up to 30% to 38% of users of fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine had valvular disease, these drugs were withdrawn from the market.	fenfluramine,103,115,Chemical/Drug	dexfenfluramine,120,135,Chemical/Drug	"[{""token"": ""fenfluramine"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""dexfenfluramine"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"	train
