OBJECTIVE: To determine whether pharmacological stress leads to prolonged but reversible left ventricular dysfunction in patients with coronary artery disease, similar to that seen after exercise.	[]
DESIGN: A randomised crossover study of recovery time of systolic and diastolic left ventricular function after exercise and dobutamine induced ischaemia.	"dobutamine	125	135	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dobutamine"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
SUBJECTS: 10 patients with stable angina, angiographically proven coronary artery disease, and normal left ventricular function.	[]
INTERVENTIONS: Treadmill exercise and dobutamine stress were performed on different days.	"dobutamine	38	48	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dobutamine"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Quantitative assessment of systolic and diastolic left ventricular function was performed using transthoracic echocardiography at baseline and at regular intervals after each test.	[]
RESULTS: Both forms of stress led to prolonged but reversible systolic and diastolic dysfunction.	[]
There was no difference in the maximum double product ( p = 0. 53) or ST depression ( p = 0. 63) with either form of stress.	[]
After exercise, ejection fraction was reduced at 15 and 30 minutes compared with baseline ( mean ( SEM), - 5. 6 ( 1. 5)%, p < 0. 05; and - 6. 1 ( 2. 2)%, p < 0. 01), and at 30 and 45 minutes after dobutamine ( - 10. 8 ( 1. 8)% and - 5. 5 ( 1. 8)%, both p < 0. 01).	"dobutamine	197	207	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dobutamine"", ""start_span"": 197, ""end_span"": 207, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Regional analysis showed a reduction in the worst affected segment 15 and 30 minutes after exercise ( - 27. 9 ( 7. 2)% and - 28. 6 ( 5. 7)%, both p < 0. 01), and at 30 minutes after dobutamine ( - 32 ( 5. 3)%, p < 0. 01).	"dobutamine	182	192	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dobutamine"", ""start_span"": 182, ""end_span"": 192, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The isovolumic relaxation period was prolonged 45 minutes after each form of stress ( p < 0. 05).	[]
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with coronary artery disease, dobutamine induced ischaemia results in prolonged reversible left ventricular dysfunction, presumed to be myocardial stunning, similar to that seen after exercise.	"dobutamine	55	65	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dobutamine"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Anorexigens and pulmonary hypertension in the United States: results from the surveillance of North American pulmonary hypertension.	[]
BACKGROUND: The use of appetite suppressants in Europe has been associated with the development of primary pulmonary hypertension ( PPH).	[]
Recently, fenfluramine appetite suppressants became widely used in the United States but were withdrawn in September 1997 because of concerns over adverse effects.	"fenfluramine	10	22	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""fenfluramine"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective surveillance study on patients diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension at 12 large referral centers in North America.	[]
Data collected on patients seen from September 1, 1996, to December 31, 1997, included the cause of the pulmonary hypertension and its severity.	[]
Patients with no identifiable cause of pulmonary hypertension were classed as PPH.	[]
A history of drug exposure also was taken with special attention on the use of antidepressants, anorexigens, and amphetamines.	"amphetamines	113	125	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""amphetamines"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
RESULTS: Five hundred seventy - nine patients were studied, 205 with PPH and 374 with pulmonary hypertension from other causes ( secondary pulmonary hypertension [ SPH]).	[]
The use of anorexigens was common in both groups.	[]
However, of the medications surveyed, only the fenfluramines had a significant preferential association with PPH as compared with SPH ( adjusted odds ratio for use > 6 months, 7. 5; 95% confidence interval, 1. 7 to 32. 4).	"fenfluramines	47	60	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""fenfluramines"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The association was stronger with longer duration of use when compared to shorter duration of use and was more pronounced in recent users than in remote users.	[]
An unexpectedly high ( 11. 4%) number of patients with SPH had used anorexigens.	[]
CONCLUSION: The magnitude of the association with PPH, the increase of association with increasing duration of use, and the specificity for fenfluramines are consistent with previous studies indicating that fenfluramines are causally related to PPH.	"fenfluramines	140	153	Chemical/Drug"	"fenfluramines	140	153	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""fenfluramines"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""fenfluramines"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The high prevalence of anorexigen use in patients with SPH also raises the possibility that these drugs precipitate pulmonary hypertension in patients with underlying conditions associated with SPH.	[]

Heparin, first used to prevent the clotting of blood in vitro, has been clinically used to treat thrombosis for more than 50 years.	"Heparin	0	7	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Heparin"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Although several new anticoagulant drugs are in development, heparin remains the anticoagulant of choice to treat acute thrombotic episodes.	"heparin	61	68	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""heparin"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The clinical effects of heparin are meritorious, but side effects do exist.	"heparin	24	31	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""heparin"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Bleeding is the primary untoward effect of heparin.	"heparin	43	50	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""heparin"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Major bleeding is of primary concern in patients receiving heparin therapy.	"heparin	59	66	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""heparin"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
However, additional important untoward effects of heparin therapy include heparin - induced thrombocytopenia, heparin - associated osteoporosis, eosinophilia, skin reactions, allergic reactions other than thrombocytopenia, alopecia, transaminasemia, hyperkalemia, hypoaldosteronism, and priapism.	"heparin	50	57	Chemical/Drug"	"heparin	50	57	Chemical/Drug"	"heparin	50	57	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""heparin"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""heparin"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""heparin"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
These side effects are relatively rare in a given individual, but given the extremely widespread use of heparin, some are quite common, particularly HITT and osteoporosis.	"heparin	104	111	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""heparin"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
"Although reasonable incidences of many of these side effects can be "" softly "" deduced from current reports dealing with unfractionated heparin, at present the incidences of these side effects with newer low molecular weight heparins appear to be much less common."	"heparin	136	143	Chemical/Drug"	"heparins	225	233	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""heparin"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""heparins"", ""start_span"": 225, ""end_span"": 233, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
However, only longer experience will more clearly define the incidence of each side effect with low molecular weight preparations.	[]

Hypercalcemia, arrhythmia, and mood stabilizers.	[]
Recent findings in a bipolar patient receiving maintenance lithium therapy who developed hypercalcemia and severe bradyarrhythmia prompted the authors to conduct a retrospective study of bipolar patients with lithium - associated hypercalcemia.

A printout of all cases of hypercalcemia that presented during a 1 - year period was generated.	[]
After eliminating spurious hypercalcemias or those associated with intravenous fluids, the authors identified 18 non - lithium - treated patients with hypercalcemias related to malignancies and other medical conditions ( group A) and 12 patients with lithium - associated hypercalcemia ( group B).

Patients in group B were not comparable to those in group A, as the latter were medically compromised and were receiving multiple pharmacotherapies.	[]
Thus, two control groups were generated: group C1, which included age - and sex - comparable lithium - treated bipolar normocalcemic patients, and group C2, which included bipolar normocalcemic patients treated with anticonvulsant mood stabilizers.	"lithium	93	100	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""lithium"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The electrocardiographic ( ECG) findings for patients in group B were compared with those of patients in groups C1 and C2.	[]
It was found that these groups did not differ in their overall frequency of ECG abnormalities; however, there were significant differences in the frequency of conduction defects.	[]
Patients with hypercalcemia resulting from medical diseases and bipolar patients with lithium - associated hypercalcemia had significantly higher frequencies of conduction defects.	"lithium	86	93	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""lithium"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Patients in group A had significant mortality at 2 - year follow - up ( 28%), in contrast to zero mortality in the other three groups.	[]
The clinical implications of these findings are discussed.	[]

Heart rate ( HR), mean arterial pressure ( MBP), positive rate of increase of left ventricular pressure ( + LVdP / dt), echocardiographically assessed left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF), and fractional shortening ( FS), as well as chronotropic response to isoproterenol and exercise - induced sympathetic stimulation were evaluated under baseline and posttreatment conditions.

Resting values of LVEF, FS, + LVdP / dt, and MBP remained unchanged whatever the drug and the dosing regimen, whereas resting HR was significantly and dose - dependently lowered after dronedarone and to a lesser extent after amiodarone.

Both dronedarone and amiodarone significantly reduced the exercise - induced tachycardia and, at the highest dose, decreased the isoproterenol - induced tachycardia.

RESULTS: A total of 49 patients ( median age: 60; range 41 - 81) entered this phase 2 trial.	[]
The median number of prior regimens was 2 ( range: 1 - 6).	[]
Six ( 12%) and 4 ( 8%) patients experienced grade 2 hand - foot syndrome and stomatitis, respectively ( no episodes of grade 3).	[]
One patient developed grade 3 diarrhea requiring hospitalization for hydration.	[]
Six ( 12%) individuals required dose reductions.	[]
The median number of courses of liposomal doxorubicin administered on this protocol was 2 ( range: 1 - 12).	"doxorubicin	42	53	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""doxorubicin"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

METHODS: Four - week, randomized, double - blind, parallel study.	[]
A total of 115 patients with a DSM - IV diagnosis of bipolar disorder, manic or mixed, were randomized to olanzapine, 5 to 20 mg / d ( n = 55), or placebo ( n = 60).	"olanzapine	106	116	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""olanzapine"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The primary efficacy measure was the Young - Mania Rating Scale ( Y - MRS) total score.	[]
Response and euthymia were defined, a priori, as at least a 50% improvement from baseline to end point and as a score of no less than 12 at end point in the Y - MRS total score, respectively.	[]
Safety was assessed using adverse events, Extrapyramidal Symptom ( EPS) rating scales, laboratory values, electrocardiograms, vital signs, and weight change.	[]
RESULTS: Olanzapine - treated patients demonstrated a statistically significant greater mean ( + / - SD) improvement in Y - MRS total score than placebo - treated patients ( - 14. 8 + / - 12. 5 and - 8. 1 + / - 12. 7, respectively; P <. 001), which was evident at the first postbaseline observation 1 week after randomization and was maintained throughout the study ( last observation carried forward).	"Olanzapine	9	19	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Olanzapine"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Olanzapine - treated patients demonstrated a higher rate of response ( 65% vs 43%, respectively; P =. 02) and euthymia ( 61% vs 36%, respectively; P =. 01) than placebo - treated patients.

PURPOSE: To assess the effect of pupil dilation on vision and driving ability.	[]
METHODS: A series of tests on various parameters of visual function and driving simulator performance were performed on 12 healthy drivers, before and after pupil dilation using guttae tropicamide 1%.

A driving simulator ( Transport Research Laboratory) was used to measure reaction time ( RT), speed maintenance and steering accuracy.	[]
Tests of basic visual function included high - and low - contrast visual acuity ( HCVA and LCVA), Pelli - Robson contrast threshold ( CT) and Goldmann perimetry ( FIELDS).	[]
Useful Field of View ( UFOV - - a test of visual attention) was also undertaken.	[]
The mean differences in the pre - and post - dilatation measurements were tested for statistical significance at the 95% level using one - tail paired t - tests.	[]
RESULTS: Pupillary dilation resulted in a statistically significant deterioration in CT and HCVA only.	[]
Five of 12 drivers also exhibited deterioration in LCVA, CT and RT.	[]
Little evidence emerged for deterioration in FIELDS and UFOV.	[]
Also, 7 of 12 drivers appeared to adjust their driving behaviour by reducing their speed on the driving simulator, leading to improved steering accuracy.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: Pupillary dilation may lead to a decrease in vision and daylight driving performance in young people.	[]
A larger study, including a broader spectrum of subjects, is warranted before guidelines can be recommended.	[]

BACKGROUND: Treatment with angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE) inhibitors reduces mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic heart failure ( CHF), but most affected patients are not receiving these agents or are being treated with doses lower than those found to be efficacious in trials, primarily because of concerns about the safety and tolerability of these agents, especially at the recommended doses.

Patients with New York Heart Association classes II to IV CHF and left ventricular ejection fractions of no greater than 0. 30 ( n = 3164) were randomized and followed up for a median of 46 months.	[]
We examined the occurrence of adverse events and the need for discontinuation and dose reduction during treatment, with a focus on hypotension and renal dysfunction.	[]
RESULTS: Of 405 patients not previously receiving an ACE inhibitor, doses in only 4. 2% could not be titrated to the medium doses required for randomization because of symptoms possibly related to hypotension ( 2. 0%) or because of renal dysfunction or hyperkalemia ( 2. 3%).

Doses in more than 90% of randomized patients in the high - and low - dose groups were titrated to their assigned target, and the mean doses of blinded medication in both groups remained similar throughout the study.	[]
Withdrawals occurred in 27. 1% of the high - and 30. 7% of the low - dose groups.	[]
Subgroups presumed to be at higher risk for ACE inhibitor intolerance ( blood pressure, < 120 mm Hg; creatinine, > or = 132. 6 micromol / L [ > or = 1. 5 mg / dL]; age, > or = 70 years; and patients with diabetes) generally tolerated the high - dose strategy.

OBJECTIVE: Myeloperoxidase antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ( MPO - ANCA) - positive vasculitis has been reported in patients with Graves ' disease who were treated with propylthiouracil ( PTU).	"propylthiouracil	173	189	Chemical/Drug"	"PTU	192	195	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""propylthiouracil"", ""start_span"": 173, ""end_span"": 189, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""PTU"", ""start_span"": 192, ""end_span"": 195, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The appearance of MPO - ANCA in these cases was suspected of being related to PTU because the titres of MPO - ANCA decreased when PTU was stopped.	"PTU	78	81	Chemical/Drug"	"PTU	78	81	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""PTU"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""PTU"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Nevertheless, there have been no studies on the temporal relationship between the appearance of MPO - ANCA and vasculitis during PTU therapy, or on the incidence of MPO - ANCA in untreated Graves ' disease patients.	"PTU	129	132	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""PTU"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Therefore, we sought to address these parameters in patients with Graves ' disease.	[]
PATIENTS: We investigated 102 untreated patients with hyperthyroidism due to Graves ' disease for the presence of MPO - ANCA, and for the development vasculitis after starting PTU therapy.	"PTU	176	179	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""PTU"", ""start_span"": 176, ""end_span"": 179, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

The remaining 73 patients ( 55 women and 18 men), all of whom were examined for more than 3 months, were adopted as the subjects of the investigation.	[]
The median observation period was 23. 6 months ( range: 3 - 37 months).	[]
MEASUREMENTS: MPO - ANCA was measured at intervals of 2 - 6 months.	[]
RESULTS: Before treatment, the MPO - ANCA titres of all 102 untreated Graves ' disease patients were within the reference range ( below 10 U / ml).	[]
Three ( 4. 1%) of the 73 patients were positive for MPO - ANCA at 13, 16 and 17 months, respectively, after the start of PTU therapy.	"PTU	121	124	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""PTU"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In two of them, the MPO - ANCA titres transiently increased to 12. 8 and 15. 0 U / ml, respectively, despite continued PTU therapy, but no vasculitic disorders developed.	"PTU	119	122	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""PTU"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In the third patient, the MPO - ANCA titre increased to 204 U / ml and she developed a higher fever, oral ulcers and polyarthralgia, but the symptoms resolved 2 weeks after stopping PTU therapy, and the MPO - ANCA titre decreased to 20. 7 U / ml by 4 months after discontinuing PTU.

Findings consistent with coronary artery disease were detected in 12 ( 34%) patients and 3 ( 9%) controls ( p = 0. 01).	[]
Decreased left ventricular systolic function was demonstrated in 5 ( 14%) patients, but in none of the controls ( p = 0. 055).	[]
Finally, resting and peak exercise abnormal left ventricular filling was detected in 38 and 35% of patients as compared to 19 and 9% of controls, respectively ( p = 0. 11 and 0. 02, respectively).	[]
We conclude that coronary artery or myocardial disease is common ( 38%) in young asymptomatic chronic cocaine users.	"cocaine	102	109	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cocaine"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Phase 2 early afterdepolarization as a trigger of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in acquired long - QT syndrome: direct evidence from intracellular recordings in the intact left ventricular wall.	[]
BACKGROUND: This study examined the role of phase 2 early afterdepolarization ( EAD) in producing a trigger to initiate torsade de pointes ( TdP) with QT prolongation induced by dl - sotalol and azimilide.	"sotalol	183	190	Chemical/Drug"	"azimilide	195	204	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sotalol"", ""start_span"": 183, ""end_span"": 190, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""azimilide"", ""start_span"": 195, ""end_span"": 204, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The contribution of transmural dispersion of repolarization ( TDR) to transmural propagation of EAD and the maintenance of TdP was also evaluated.	[]
METHODS AND RESULTS: Transmembrane action potentials from epicardium, midmyocardium, and endocardium were recorded simultaneously, together with a transmural ECG, in arterially perfused canine and rabbit left ventricular preparations.	[]
dl - Sotalol preferentially prolonged action potential duration ( APD) in M cells dose - dependently ( 1 to 100 micromol / L), leading to QT prolongation and an increase in TDR.	"Sotalol	5	12	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Sotalol"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Azimilide, however, significantly prolonged APD and QT interval at concentrations from 0. 1 to 10 micromol / L but shortened them at 30 micromol / L.	"Azimilide	0	9	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Azimilide"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Unlike dl - sotalol, azimilide ( > 3 micromol / L) increased epicardial APD markedly, causing a diminished TDR.	"sotalol	12	19	Chemical/Drug"	"azimilide	21	30	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sotalol"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""azimilide"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Although both dl - sotalol and azimilide rarely induced EADs in canine left ventricles, they produced frequent EADs in rabbits, in which more pronounced QT prolongation was seen.	"sotalol	19	26	Chemical/Drug"	"azimilide	31	40	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sotalol"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""azimilide"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
An increase in TDR by dl - sotalol facilitated transmural propagation of EADs that initiated multiple episodes of spontaneous TdP in 3 of 6 rabbit left ventricles.	"sotalol	27	34	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sotalol"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Of note, although azimilide ( 3 to 10 micromol / L) increased APD more than dl - sotalol, its EADs often failed to propagate transmurally, probably because of a diminished TDR.	"azimilide	18	27	Chemical/Drug"	"sotalol	81	88	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""azimilide"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""sotalol"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first direct evidence from intracellular action potential recordings that phase 2 EAD can be generated from intact ventricular wall and produce a trigger to initiate the onset of TdP under QT prolongation.	[]

Because of the theoretical concern regarding administration of dobutamine in the setting of cocaine use, we conducted a pilot study to assess the safety of DSE in emergency department patients with cocaine - associated chest pain.

METHODS: A prospective case series was conducted in the intensive diagnostic and treatment unit in the ED of an urban tertiary - care teaching hospital.	[]
Patients were eligible for DSE if they had used cocaine within 24 hours preceding the onset of chest pain and had a normal ECG and tropinin I level.	"cocaine	48	55	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cocaine"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

All patients were admitted to the hospital for serial testing after the DSE testing in the intensive diagnostic and treatment unit.	[]
RESULTS: Twenty - four patients were enrolled.	[]
Two patients had inadequate resting images, one DSE was terminated because of inferior hypokinesis, another DSE was terminated because of a rate - related atrial conduction deficit, and 1 patient did not reach the target heart rate.	[]
Thus, 19 patients completed a DSE and reached their target heart rates.	[]
None of the patients experienced signs of exaggerated adrenergic response, which was defined as a systolic blood pressure of greater than 200 mm Hg or the occurrence of tachydysrhythmias ( excluding sinus tachycardia).	[]
Further suggesting lack of exaggerated adrenergic response, 13 ( 65%) of 20 patients required supplemental atropine to reach their target heart rates.	"atropine	107	115	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""atropine"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and cranial sonograms obtained during a 1 - year period on 122 premature ( < 36 weeks of gestation) infants.	[]
Infants were categorized into 1 of 2 groups: those exposed to cocaine and those not exposed to cocaine.

RESULTS: Five of the 122 infants were excluded from the study because of insufficient medical and drug histories.	[]
The incidence of subependymal cysts in the 117 remaining infants was 14% ( 16 of 117).	[]
The incidence of subependymal cysts in infants exposed to cocaine prenatally was 44% ( 8 of 18) compared with 8% ( 8 of 99) in the unexposed group ( p < 0. 01).	"cocaine	58	65	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cocaine"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
CONCLUSIONS: We found an increased incidence of subependymal cyst formation in preterm infants who were exposed to cocaine prenatally.	"cocaine	115	122	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cocaine"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

NCS included recording of sensory nerve action potentials ( SNAPs) from median, radial, ulnar, and sural nerves.	[]
SNAP amplitudes for each nerve were expressed as the percentage of its baseline, and the mean of the four was termed the SNAP index.	[]
A 40% decline in the SNAP index was considered clinically significant.	[]
Thalidomide was discontinued in 55 patients for lack of therapeutic response.	"Thalidomide	0	11	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Thalidomide"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Six patients developed neuropathy.	[]
Clinical symptoms and a decline in the SNAP index occurred concurrently.	[]
Older age and cumulative dose were possible contributing factors.	[]
Neuropathy may thus be a common complication of thalidomide in older patients.	"thalidomide	48	59	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""thalidomide"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

The participation of reactive oxygen species in aminoglycoside - induced ototoxicity has been deduced from observations that aminoglycoside - iron complexes catalyze the formation of superoxide radicals in vitro and that antioxidants attenuate ototoxicity in vivo.

We therefore hypothesized that overexpression of Cu / Zn - superoxide dismutase ( h - SOD1) should protect transgenic mice from ototoxicity.

Auditory thresholds were tested by evoked auditory brain stem responses at 1 month after birth.	[]
In nontransgenic animals, the threshold in the kanamycin - treated group was 45 - 50 dB higher than in saline - injected controls.	"kanamycin	47	56	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""kanamycin"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

The effects were similar at 12 and 24 kHz.	[]
The protection by overexpression of superoxide dismutase supports the hypothesis that oxidant stress plays a significant role in aminoglycoside - induced ototoxicity.

RESULTS: Twenty - nine patients were assessable for response, and 35 patients were assessable for toxicity.	[]
The overall response rate was 38%, the median time to response was 10 weeks, the median duration of response was 26 weeks, and the median survival was 37 weeks.	[]
The main toxic effect was myelosuppression, with Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia in 16 patients, anemia in 12 patients, thrombocytopenia in 11 patients, and neutropenic fever in 3 patients.	[]
Four patients had five infusion - related reactions during the infusion of liposomal doxorubicin, leading to treatment discontinuation in three patients.	"doxorubicin	85	96	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""doxorubicin"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Grade > or = 2 nonhematologic toxicity included nausea in 17 patients, emesis in 14 patients, fatigue in 9 patients, mucositis and / or stomatitis in 8 patients, constipation in 6 patients, weight loss in 5 patients, hand - foot syndrome in 2 patients, and skin reactions in 3 patients.	[]

Antimicrobial - induced mania ( antibiomania): a review of spontaneous reports.	[]
The authors reviewed reported cases of antibiotic - induced manic episodes by means of a MEDLINE and PsychLit search for reports of antibiotic - induced mania.	[]
Unpublished reports were requested from the World Health Organization ( WHO) and the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA).	[]
Twenty - one reports of antimicrobial - induced mania were found in the literature.	[]
There were 6 cases implicating clarithromycin, 13 implicating isoniazid, and 1 case each implicating erythromycin and amoxicillin.

The WHO reported 82 cases.	[]
Of these, clarithromycin was implicated in 23 ( 27. 6%) cases, ciprofloxacin in 12 ( 14. 4%) cases, and ofloxacin in 10 ( 12%) cases.

Cotrimoxazole, metronidazole, and erythromycin were involved in 15 reported manic episodes.

Statistical analysis of the data would not have demonstrated a significant statistical correlative risk and was therefore not undertaken.	[]
Patients have an increased risk of developing mania while being treated with antimicrobials.	[]
Although this is not a statistically significant risk, physicians must be aware of the effect and reversibility.	[]
Further research clearly is required to determine the incidence of antimicrobial - induced mania, the relative risk factors of developing an antimicrobial - induced manic episode among various demographic populations, and the incidence of patients who continue to have persistent affective disorders once the initial episode, which occurs while the patient is taking antibiotics, subsides.

PURPOSE: This retrospective study used a pharmaceutical company ' s global safety database to determine the reporting rate of hyponatremia and / or syndrome of inappropriate secretion of anti - diuretic hormone ( SIADH) among vincristine - treated patients and to explore the possibility of at - risk population subgroups.	"vincristine	226	237	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""vincristine"", ""start_span"": 226, ""end_span"": 237, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METHOD: We searched the Eli Lilly and Company ' s computerized adverse event database for all reported cases of hyponatremia and / or SIADH as of 1 November 1999 that had been reported during the use of vincristine.	"vincristine	203	214	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""vincristine"", ""start_span"": 203, ""end_span"": 214, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
RESULTS: A total of 76 cases of hyponatremia and / or SIADH associated with vincristine use were identified.	"vincristine	76	87	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""vincristine"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The overall reporting rate was estimated to be 1. 3 / 100, 000 treated patients.	[]
The average age of patients was 35. 6 + / - 28. 3 years, and 62% were males.	[]
Approximately 75% of the patients were receiving treatment for leukemia or lymphoma.	[]
Among the 39 reports that included information on race, the racial distribution was: 1 Black, 3 Caucasian, and 35 Asian.	[]

The present study describes the delayed development of a severe bladder pathology in a susceptible strain of mice ( DBA / 2) but not in a resistant strain ( C57BL / 6) when both were treated with a single 300 mg / kg dose of cyclophosphamide ( CY).

Inbred DBA / 2 and C57BL / 6 female mice were injected with CY, and the effect of the drug on the bladder was assessed during 100 days by light microscopy using different staining procedures, and after 30 days by conventional electron microscopy.	"CY	60	62	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""CY"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

After 30 days of CY injection ulcerous and non - ulcerous forms of chronic cystitis appeared in 86% of DBA / 2 mice but only in 4% of C57BL / 6 mice.	"CY	17	19	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""CY"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Delayed cystitis was characterized by infiltration and transepithelial passage into the lumen of inflammatory cells and by frequent exfoliation of the urothelium.	[]
Mast cells appeared in the connective and muscular layers of the bladder at a much higher number in DBA / 2 mice than in C57BL / 6 mice or untreated controls.	[]
Electron microscopy disclosed the absence of the typical discoidal vesicles normally present in the cytoplasm of surface cells.	[]
Instead, numerous abnormal vesicles containing one or several dark granules were observed in the cytoplasm of cells from all the epithelial layers.	[]
Delayed cystitis still persisted in DBA / 2 mice 100 days after treatment.	[]
These results indicate that delayed toxicity of CY in female DBA / 2 mice causes a bladder pathology that is not observed in C57BL / 6 mice.	"CY	48	50	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""CY"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Treatment given on an outpatient basis, using portable pump systems, was repeated on day 57.	[]
Patients ' characteristics were: male / female ratio 20 / 13; median age 57 ( 27 - 75) years; median WHO status 1 ( 0 - 2).	[]
18 patients had a primary AGC, and 15 showed a relapsed AGC.	[]
Median follow - up was 11. 8 months ( range of those surviving: 2. 7 - 11. 8 months).	[]
RESULTS: 32 patients were evaluable for response - complete remission 9. 1% ( n = 3), partial remission 45. 5% ( n = 15), no change 27. 3% ( n = 9), progressive disease 15. 1% ( n = 5).	[]
Median overall survival time was 10. 2 months [ 95% confidence interval ( CI): 8. 7 - 11. 6], and median progression - free survival time was 7. 6 months ( 95% CI: 4. 4 - 10. 9).	[]
The worst toxicities (%) observed were ( CTC - NCI 1 / 2 / 3): leukopenia 45. 5 / 18. 2 / 6. 1, thrombocytopenia 33. 3 / 9. 1 / 6. 1, vomitus 24. 2 / 9. 1 / 0, diarrhea 36. 4 / 6. 1 / 3. 0, stomatitis 18. 2 / 9. 1 / 0, hand - foot syndrome 12. 1 / 0 / 0.	[]

Outcomes included CK - MB MI ( CK - MB > or = 8 ng / mL with a relative index [ ( CK - MB x 100) / total CK] > or = 4, cardiac death, and significant coronary disease ( > or = 50%).	[]
RESULTS: Of the 246 admitted patients, 34 ( 14%) met CK - MB criteria for MI and 38 ( 16%) had cTnI elevations.	[]
Angiography was performed in 29 of 38 patients who were cTnI - positive, with significant disease present in 25 ( 86%).	[]
Three of the four patients without significant disease who had cTnI elevations met CK - MB criteria for MI, and the other had a peak CK - MB level of 13 ng / mL.	[]
Sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative likelihood ratios for predicting cardiac death or significant disease were high for both CK - MB MI and cTnI and were not significantly different.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with cTnI elevations meet CK - MB criteria for MI, as well as have a high incidence of underlying significant disease.	[]
Troponin appears to have an equivalent diagnostic accuracy compared with CK - MB for diagnosing necrosis in patients with cocaine - associated chest pain and suspected MI.

CONCLUSIONS: Although levobupivacaine may have a safer cardiac toxicity profile than racemic bupivacaine, if adequate amounts of levobupivacaine reach the circulation, it will result in convulsions.

Consistent with other reports this case of TdP occurred in the context of multiple exacerbating factors including hypokalemia and digoxin excess.	"digoxin	130	137	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""digoxin"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Transient prolongation of the QT during bladder irrigation prompted the episode of TdP.	[]
It is well known that bradycardia exacerbates acquired TdP.	[]
The authors speculate that the increased vagal tone during bladder irrigation, a vagal maneuver, in the context of amiodarone therapy resulted in amiodarone - induced proarrhythmia.

Respiratory pattern in a rat model of epilepsy.	[]
PURPOSE: Apnea is known to occur during seizures, but systematic studies of ictal respiratory changes in adults are few.	[]
Data regarding respiratory pattern defects during interictal periods also are scarce.	[]
Here we sought to generate information with regard to the interictal period in animals with pilocarpine - induced epilepsy.	"pilocarpine	92	103	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""pilocarpine"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METHODS: Twelve rats ( six chronically epileptic animals and six controls) were anesthetized, given tracheotomies, and subjected to hyperventilation or hypoventilation conditions.	[]
Breathing movements caused changes in thoracic volume and forced air to flow tidally through a pneumotachograph.	[]
This flow was measured by using a differential pressure transducer, passed through a polygraph, and from this to a computer with custom software that derived ventilation ( VE), tidal volume ( VT), inspiratory time ( TI), expiratory time ( TE), breathing frequency ( f), and mean inspiratory flow ( VT / TI) on a breath - by - breath basis.	[]
RESULTS: The hyperventilation maneuver caused a decrease in spontaneous ventilation in pilocarpine - treated and control rats.	"pilocarpine	87	98	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""pilocarpine"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Although VE had a similar decrease in both groups, in the epileptic group, the decrease in VE was due to a significant ( p < 0. 05) increase in TE peak in relation to that of the control animals.	[]
The hypoventilation maneuver led to an increase in the arterial Paco2, followed by an increase in VE.	[]
In the epileptic group, the increase in VE was mediated by a significant ( p < 0. 05) decrease in TE peak compared with the control group.	[]
Systemic application of KCN, to evaluate the effects of peripheral chemoreception activation on ventilation, led to a similar increase in VE for both groups.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that pilocarpine - treated animals have an altered ability to react to ( or compensate for) blood gas changes with changes in ventilation and suggest that it is centrally determined.

The effects of progesterone treatment on bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity in beating rat heart myocyte cultures and on anesthetized rats were determined.

After determining the bupivacaine AD50 ( the concentration of bupivacaine that caused 50% of all beating rat heart myocyte cultures to become arrhythmic), we determined the effect of 1 - hour progesterone HCl exposure on myocyte contractile rhythm.	"bupivacaine	22	33	Chemical/Drug"	"bupivacaine	22	33	Chemical/Drug"	"progesterone	192	204	Chemical/Drug"	"HCl	205	208	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""bupivacaine"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""bupivacaine"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""progesterone"", ""start_span"": 192, ""end_span"": 204, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""HCl"", ""start_span"": 205, ""end_span"": 208, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Each concentration of progesterone ( 6. 25, 12. 5, 25, and 50 micrograms / ml) caused a significant and concentration - dependent reduction in the AD50 for bupivacaine.	"progesterone	22	34	Chemical/Drug"	"bupivacaine	156	167	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""progesterone"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""bupivacaine"", ""start_span"": 156, ""end_span"": 167, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Estradiol treatment also increased the arrhythmogenicity of bupivacaine in myocyte cultures, but was only one fourth as potent as progesterone.

Neither progesterone nor estradiol effects on bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity were potentiated by epinephrine.

Chronic progesterone pretreatment ( 5 mg / kg / day for 21 days) caused a significant increase in bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity in intact pentobarbital - anesthetized rats.	"progesterone	8	20	Chemical/Drug"	"bupivacaine	98	109	Chemical/Drug"	"pentobarbital	138	151	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""progesterone"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""bupivacaine"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""pentobarbital"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
There was a significant decrease in the time to onset of arrhythmia as compared with control nonprogesterone - treated rats ( 6. 2 + / - 1. 3 vs. 30. 8 + / - 2. 5 min, mean + / - SE).	[]
The results of this study indicate that progesterone can potentiate bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity both in vivo and in vitro.

Potentiation of bupivacaine arrhythmia in myocyte cultures suggests that this effect is at least partly mediated at the myocyte level.	"bupivacaine	16	27	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""bupivacaine"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Increased serum soluble Fas in patients with acute liver failure due to paracetamol overdose.	"paracetamol	72	83	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""paracetamol"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
BACKGROUND / AIMS: Experimental studies have suggested that apoptosis via the Fas / Fas Ligand signaling system may play an important role in the development of acute liver failure.	[]
The aim of the study was to investigate the soluble form of Fas in patients with acute liver failure.	[]
METHODOLOGY: Serum levels of sFas ( soluble Fas) were measured by ELISA in 24 patients with acute liver failure and 10 normal control subjects.	[]
Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor - alpha and interferon - gamma were also determined by ELISA.	[]
RESULTS: Serum sFas was significantly increased in patients with acute liver failure ( median, 26. 8 U / mL; range, 6. 9 - 52. 7 U / mL) compared to the normal controls ( median, 8. 6 U / mL; range, 6. 5 - 12. 0 U / mL, P < 0. 0001).	[]
Levels were significantly greater in patients with acute liver failure due to paracetamol overdose ( median, 28. 7 U / mL; range, 12. 8 - 52. 7 U / mL, n = 17) than those due to non - A to E hepatitis ( median, 12. 5 U / mL; range, 6. 9 - 46. 0 U / mL, n = 7, P < 0. 01).	"paracetamol	78	89	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""paracetamol"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
There was no relationship of sFas to eventual outcome in the patients.	[]
A significant correlation was observed between serum sFas levels and aspartate aminotransferase ( r = 0. 613, P < 0. 01).	"aspartate	69	78	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""aspartate"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
CONCLUSIONS: The increased concentration of sFas in serum of patients with acute liver failure may reflect activation of Fas - mediated apoptosis in the liver and this together with increased tumor necrosis factor - alpha may be an important factor in liver cell loss.	[]
Bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation for Parkinson ' s disease.	[]
High frequency stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus ( STN) is known to ameliorate the signs and symptoms of advanced Parkinson ' s disease.	[]
AIM: We studied the effect of high frequency STN stimulation in 23 patients.	[]
METHOD: Twenty - three patients suffering from severe Parkinson ' s disease ( Stages III - V on Hoehn and Yahr scale) and, particularly bradykinesia, rigidity, and levodopa - induced dyskinesias underwent bilateral implantation of electrodes in the STN.	"levodopa	164	172	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""levodopa"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 172, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
"Preoperative and postoperative assessments of these patients at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months follow - up, in "" on "" and "" off "" drug conditions, was carried out using Unified Parkinson ' s Disease Rating Scale, Hoehn and Yahr staging, England activities of daily living score and video recordings."	[]
RESULTS: After one year of electrical stimulation of the STN, the patients ' scores for activities of daily living and motor examination scores ( Unified Parkinson ' s Disease Rating Scale parts II and III) off medication improved by 62% and 61% respectively ( p < 0. 0005).	[]
The subscores for the akinesia, rigidity, tremor and gait also improved.	[]
( p < 0. 0005).	[]
The average levodopa dose decreased from 813 mg to 359 mg.	"levodopa	12	20	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""levodopa"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Due to an accidental malfunctioning of the infusion pump, the patient was inadvertently administered a toxic dosage of the drug which caused renal insufficiency.	[]
Given the progressive deterioration of the symptoms and of the laboratory values, despite adequate medical treatment, a decision was made to introduce haemodialytical therapy in order to remove the drug and therapy reduce the nephrotoxicity.	[]
From the results obtained, haemodialysis can therefore be suggested as a useful therapy in rare cases of progressive acute renal failure caused by desferrioxamine.

BACKGROUND: Focal subtenon carboplatin injections have recently been used as a presumably toxicity - free adjunct to systemic chemotherapy for intraocular retinoblastoma.	"carboplatin	27	38	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""carboplatin"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
OBJECTIVE: To report our clinical experience with abnormal ocular motility in patients treated with subtenon carboplatin chemotherapy.	"carboplatin	109	120	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""carboplatin"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

During ocular manipulation under general anesthesia, we assessed their eyes by forced duction testing, comparing ocular motility after tumor control with ocular motility at diagnosis.	[]
Eyes subsequently enucleated because of treatment failure ( n = 4) were examined histologically.	[]
RESULTS: Limitation of ocular motility was detected in all 12 eyes of 10 patients treated for intraocular retinoblastoma with 1 to 6 injections of subtenon carboplatin as part of multimodality therapy.	"carboplatin	156	167	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""carboplatin"", ""start_span"": 156, ""end_span"": 167, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Histopathological examination revealed many lipophages in the periorbital fat surrounding the optic nerve in 1 eye, indicative of phagocytosis of previously existing fat cells and suggesting prior fat necrosis.	[]
The enucleations were technically difficult and hazardous for globe rupture because of extensive orbital soft tissue adhesions.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: Subtenon carboplatin chemotherapy is associated with significant fibrosis of orbital soft tissues, leading to mechanical restriction of eye movements and making subsequent enucleation difficult.

The clinical characteristics and initial and final visual acuity were analyzed to determine visual outcome.	[]
RESULTS: All patients had optic neuropathy between 1 to 6 months ( mean = 2. 9 months) after starting ethambutol therapy at a dosage ranging from 13 to 20 mg / kg / day ( mean = 17 mg / kg / day).	"ethambutol	102	112	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ethambutol"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Seven ( 54%) of the 13 patients experienced visual recovery after stopping the drug.	[]
Of 6 patients with irreversible visual impairment, 4 patients had diabetes mellitus, glaucoma and a history of heavy smoking.	[]
CONCLUSION: Early recognition of optic neuropathy should be considered in patients with ethambutol therapy.	"ethambutol	88	98	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ethambutol"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

PURPOSE: To determine the natural history of visual field defects in a group of patients known to have Vigabatrin - associated changes who elected to continue the medication because of good seizure control.	"Vigabatrin	103	113	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Vigabatrin"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METHODS: All patients taking Vigabatrin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs for at least 5 years ( range 5 - 12 years) were entered into a visual surveillance programme.	"Vigabatrin	29	39	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Vigabatrin"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Patients were followed up at 6 - monthly intervals for not less than 18 months ( range 18 - 43 months).	[]
In all, 16 patients with unequivocal defects continued the medication.	[]
Following already published methodology ( Eye 2002; 16; 567 - 571) monocular mean radial degrees ( MRDs) to the I / 4e isopter on Goldmann perimetry was calculated for the right eye at the time of discovery of a visual field defect and again after not less than 18 months follow - up.	[]
RESULTS: Mean right eye MRD at presentation was 36. 98 degrees ( range 22. 25 - 51. 0), compared to 38. 40 degrees ( range 22. 5 - 49. 75) after follow - up; P = 0. 338 unpaired t - test.	[]
Only one patient demonstrated a deterioration in visual field during the study period and discontinued treatment.	[]
CONCLUSION: Established visual field defects presumed to be due to Vigabatrin therapy did not usually progress in spite of continuing use of the medication.	"Vigabatrin	67	77	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Vigabatrin"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

BACKGROUND: Tacrolimus ointment is increasingly used for anti - inflammatory treatment of sensitive areas such as the face, and recent observations indicate that the treatment is effective in steroid - aggravated rosacea and perioral dermatitis.	"Tacrolimus	12	22	Chemical/Drug"	"steroid	192	199	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Tacrolimus"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""steroid"", ""start_span"": 192, ""end_span"": 199, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We report on rosaceiform dermatitis as a complication of treatment with tacrolimus ointment.	"tacrolimus	72	82	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""tacrolimus"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
OBSERVATIONS: Six adult patients with inflammatory facial dermatoses were treated with tacrolimus ointment because of the ineffectiveness of standard treatments.	"tacrolimus	87	97	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""tacrolimus"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Within 2 to 3 weeks of initially effective and well - tolerated treatment, 3 patients with a history of rosacea and 1 with a history of acne experienced sudden worsening with pustular rosaceiform lesions.	[]
Biopsy revealed an abundance of Demodex mites in 2 of these patients.	[]
In 1 patient with eyelid eczema, rosaceiform periocular dermatitis gradually appeared after 3 weeks of treatment.	[]
In 1 patient with atopic dermatitis, telangiectatic and papular rosacea insidiously appeared after 5 months of treatment.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: Our observations suggest that the spectrum of rosaceiform dermatitis as a complication of treatment with tacrolimus ointment is heterogeneous.	"tacrolimus	118	128	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""tacrolimus"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
A variety of factors, such as vasoactive properties of tacrolimus, proliferation of Demodex due to local immunosuppression, and the occlusive properties of the ointment, may be involved in the observed phenomena.

Structural abnormalities in the brains of human subjects who use methamphetamine.	"methamphetamine	65	80	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""methamphetamine"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We visualize, for the first time, the profile of structural deficits in the human brain associated with chronic methamphetamine ( MA) abuse.	"methamphetamine	112	127	Chemical/Drug"	"MA	130	132	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""methamphetamine"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""MA"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Studies of human subjects who have used MA chronically have revealed deficits in dopaminergic and serotonergic systems and cerebral metabolic abnormalities.	"MA	40	42	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""MA"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Using magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) and new computational brain - mapping techniques, we determined the pattern of structural brain alterations associated with chronic MA abuse in human subjects and related these deficits to cognitive impairment.	"MA	172	174	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""MA"", ""start_span"": 172, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We used high - resolution MRI and surface - based computational image analyses to map regional abnormalities in the cortex, hippocampus, white matter, and ventricles in 22 human subjects who used MA and 21 age - matched, healthy controls.	"MA	196	198	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""MA"", ""start_span"": 196, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Cortical maps revealed severe gray - matter deficits in the cingulate, limbic, and paralimbic cortices of MA abusers ( averaging 11. 3% below control; p < 0. 05).	"MA	106	108	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""MA"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
On average, MA abusers had 7. 8% smaller hippocampal volumes than control subjects ( p < 0. 01; left, p = 0. 01; right, p < 0. 05) and significant white - matter hypertrophy ( 7. 0%; p < 0. 01).	"MA	12	14	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""MA"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Hippocampal deficits were mapped and correlated with memory performance on a word - recall test ( p < 0. 05).	[]
MRI - based maps suggest that chronic methamphetamine abuse causes a selective pattern of cerebral deterioration that contributes to impaired memory performance.

Prominent white - matter hypertrophy may result from altered myelination and adaptive glial changes, including gliosis secondary to neuronal damage.	[]
These brain substrates may help account for the symptoms of MA abuse, providing therapeutic targets for drug - induced brain injury.	"MA	60	62	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""MA"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Disruption of hepatic lipid homeostasis in mice after amiodarone treatment is associated with peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - alpha target gene activation.	"amiodarone	54	64	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""amiodarone"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Amiodarone, an efficacious and widely used antiarrhythmic agent, has been reported to cause hepatotoxicity in some patients.	"Amiodarone	0	10	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Amiodarone"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
To gain insight into the mechanism of this unwanted effect, mice were administered various doses of amiodarone and examined for changes in hepatic histology and gene regulation.

Northern blot analysis of hepatic RNA revealed a dose - dependent increase in the expression of a number of genes critical for fatty acid oxidation, lipoprotein assembly, and lipid transport.	"fatty acid	127	137	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""fatty acid"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Many of these genes are regulated by the peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - alpha ( PPARalpha), a ligand - activated nuclear hormone receptor transcription factor.	[]
The absence of induction of these genes as well as hepatomegaly in PPARalpha knockout [ PPARalpha - / -] mice indicated that the effects of amiodarone were dependent upon the presence of a functional PPARalpha gene.	"amiodarone	140	150	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""amiodarone"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Compared to wild - type mice, treatment of PPARalpha - / - mice with amiodarone resulted in an increased rate and extent of total body weight loss.	"amiodarone	69	79	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""amiodarone"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The inability of amiodarone to directly activate either human or mouse PPARalpha transiently expressed in human HepG2 hepatoma cells indicates that the effects of amiodarone on the function of this receptor were indirect.	"amiodarone	17	27	Chemical/Drug"	"amiodarone	17	27	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""amiodarone"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""amiodarone"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Based upon these results, we conclude that amiodarone disrupts hepatic lipid homeostasis and that the increased expression of PPARalpha target genes is secondary to this toxic effect.	"amiodarone	43	53	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""amiodarone"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
These results provide important new mechanistic information regarding the hepatotoxic effects of amiodarone and indicate that PPARalpha protects against amiodarone - induced hepatotoxicity.

Furthermore, at 5, 10 and 20 mg / kg, trazodone blocks 5 - HT 2A and 5 - HT 2C receptors.

We suggest that trazodone ( 5, 10 and 20 mg / kg), by blocking the 5 - HT 2C receptors, releases the nigrostriatal DAergic neurons from tonic inhibition caused by 5 - HT, and thereby potentiates dexamphetamine stereotypy and antagonizes haloperidol catalepsy.

Swallowing abnormalities and dyskinesia in Parkinson ' s disease.	[]
Gastrointestinal abnormalities in Parkinson ' s disease ( PD) have been known for almost two centuries, but many aspects concerning their pathophysiology have not been completely clarified.	[]

Nondyskinetic patients, but not the dyskinetic ones, showed less oropharyngeal swallowing efficiency ( OPSE) for liquid food than controls ( Dunnett, P = 0. 02).	[]
Dyskinetic patients tended to have a greater OPSE than nondyskinetic ( Dunnett, P = 0. 06).	[]
Patients who were using a higher dose of levodopa had a greater OPSE and a trend toward a smaller oral transit time ( Pearson ' s correlation, P = 0. 01 and 0. 08, respectively).

Neither the report of dysphagia nor any of the PD severity parameters correlated to the videofluoroscopic variables.	[]
In the current study, dyskinetic patients performed better in swallowing function, which could be explained on the basis of a greater levodopa dose.	"levodopa	134	142	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""levodopa"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

BACKGROUND: Patients with primary systemic amyloidosis ( AL) have a poor prognosis.	[]
Median survival time from standard treatments is only 17 months.	[]
High - dose intravenous melphalan followed by peripheral blood stem cell transplant ( PBSCT) appears to be the most promising therapy, but treatment mortality can be high.	"melphalan	24	33	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""melphalan"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

This study was undertaken to further examine its risk factors and impact on posttransplant mortality.	[]
METHODS: Consecutive AL patients who underwent PBSCT were studied retrospectively.	[]
Acute renal insufficiency ( ARI) after high - dose melphalan was defined by a minimum increase of 0. 5 mg / dL ( 44 micromol / L) in the serum creatinine level that is greater than 50% of baseline immediately after conditioning.

Urine sediment score was the sum of the individual types of sediment identified on urine microscopy.	[]
RESULTS: Of the 80 patients studied, ARI developed in 18. 8% of the patients after high - dose melphalan.	"melphalan	95	104	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""melphalan"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Univariate analysis identified age, hypoalbuminemia, heavy proteinuria, diuretic use, and urine sediment score ( > 3) as risk factors.	[]
Age and urine sediment score remained independently significant risk factors in the multivariate analysis.	[]
Patients who had ARI after high - dose melphalan underwent dialysis more often ( P = 0. 007), and had a worse 1 - year survival ( P = 0. 03).	"melphalan	39	48	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""melphalan"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
CONCLUSION: The timing of renal injury strongly suggests melphalan as the causative agent.	"melphalan	57	66	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""melphalan"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Ongoing tubular injury may be a prerequisite for renal injury by melphalan as evidenced by the active urinary sediment.	"melphalan	65	74	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""melphalan"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Blood pressure was manipulated by one of the following schedules during 120 min of reperfusion: Control, normotensive reperfusion; 90 / hypertension ( 90 / HTN), blood pressure was increased by 35 mm Hg during the initial 90 min of reperfusion only; 15 / hypertension ( 15 / HTN), normotensive reperfusion for 30 min followed by 15 min of hypertension and 75 min of normotension.	[]
Part A, for eight rats in each group brain injury was evaluated by staining tissue using 2, 3, 5 - triphenyltetrazolium chloride and edema was evaluated by microgravimetry.	[]
Part B, for eight different rats in each group blood - brain barrier permeability was evaluated by measuring the amount and extent of extravasation of Evans Blue dye.	[]
Brain injury ( percentage of the ischemic hemisphere) was less in the 15 / HTN group ( 16 + / - 6, mean + / - SD) versus the 90 / HTN group ( 30 + / - 6), which was in turn less than the control group ( 42 + / - 5).	[]
Specific gravity was greater in the 15 / HTN group ( 1. 043 + / - 0. 002) versus the 90 / HTN ( 1. 036 + / - 0. 003) and control ( 1. 037 + / - 0. 003) groups.	[]
Evans Blue ( mug g - 1 of brain tissue) was greater in the 90 / HTN group ( 24. 4 + / - 6. 0) versus the control group ( 12. 3 + / - 4. 1), which was in turn greater than the 15 / HTN group ( 7. 3 + / - 3. 2).

Case - control study of regular analgesic and nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory use and end - stage renal disease.	[]
BACKGROUND: Studies on the association between the long - term use of aspirin and other analgesic and nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) and end - stage renal disease ( ESRD) have given conflicting results.	"aspirin	70	77	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""aspirin"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In order to examine this association, a case - control study with incident cases of ESRD was carried out.	[]
METHODS: The cases were all patients entering the local dialysis program because of ESRD in the study area between June 1, 1995 and November 30, 1997.	[]
They were classified according to the underlying disease, which had presumably led them to ESRD.	[]
Controls were patients admitted to the same hospitals from where the cases arose, also matched by age and sex.	[]
Odds ratios were calculated using a conditional logistic model, including potential confounding factors, both for the whole study population and for the various underlying diseases.	[]
RESULTS: Five hundred and eighty - three cases and 1190 controls were included in the analysis.	[]
Long - term use of any analgesic was associated with an overall odds ratio of 1. 22 ( 95% CI, 0. 89 - 1. 66).	[]
For specific groups of drugs, the risks were 1. 56 ( 1. 05 - 2. 30) for aspirin, 1. 03 ( 0. 60 - 1. 76) for pyrazolones, 0. 80 ( 0. 39 - 1. 63) for paracetamol, and 0. 94 ( 0. 57 - 1. 56) for nonaspirin NSAIDs.

The risk of ESRD associated with aspirin was related to the cumulated dose and duration of use, and it was particularly high among the subset of patients with vascular nephropathy as underlying disease [ 2. 35 ( 1. 17 - 4. 72)].	"aspirin	33	40	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""aspirin"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that long - term use of nonaspirin analgesic drugs and NSAIDs is not associated with an increased risk of ESRD.	[]
However, the chronic use of aspirin may increase the risk of ESRD.	"aspirin	28	35	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""aspirin"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

PURPOSE: GAP43 has been thought to be linked with mossy fiber sprouting ( MFS) in various experimental models of epilepsy.	[]
To investigate how GAP43 expression ( GAP43 - ir) correlates with MFS, we assessed the intensity ( densitometry) and extension ( width) of GAP43 - ir in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus ( IML) of rats subject to status epilepticus induced by pilocarpine ( Pilo), previously injected or not with cycloheximide ( CHX), which has been shown to inhibit MFS.

The Pilo group was injected with the same drugs, except for CHX.	"Pilo	4	8	Chemical/Drug"	"CHX	60	63	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Pilo"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""CHX"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Animals were killed between 30 and 60 days later, and brain sections were processed for GAP43 immunohistochemistry.	[]
RESULTS: Densitometry showed no significant difference regarding GAP43 - ir in the IML between Pilo, CHX + Pilo, and control groups.	"Pilo	95	99	Chemical/Drug"	"CHX	101	104	Chemical/Drug"	"Pilo	95	99	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Pilo"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""CHX"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""Pilo"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
However, the results of the width of the GAP43 - ir band in the IML showed that CHX + Pilo and control animals had a significantly larger band ( p = 0. 03) as compared with that in the Pilo group.	"CHX	80	83	Chemical/Drug"	"Pilo	86	90	Chemical/Drug"	"Pilo	86	90	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""CHX"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""Pilo"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""Pilo"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
CONCLUSIONS: Our current finding that animals in the CHX + Pilo group have a GAP43 - ir band in the IML, similar to that of controls, reinforces prior data on the blockade of MFS in these animals.

The change in GAP43 - ir present in Pilo - treated animals was a thinning of the band to a very narrow layer just above the granule cell layer that is likely to be associated with the loss of hilar cell projections that express GAP - 43.

Epidemiological studies showed that they were generally used concurrently.	[]
Although some studies in experimental animals indicate clear pharmacological interactions between them, no studies have shown a specific interaction on anxiety responses.	[]
OBJECTIVES: The present study investigates the effects of nicotine on anxiety induced by caffeine and another anxiogenic drug, pentylenetetrazole, in mice.	"nicotine	58	66	Chemical/Drug"	"caffeine	89	97	Chemical/Drug"	"pentylenetetrazole	127	145	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""nicotine"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""caffeine"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""pentylenetetrazole"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The elevated plus - maze ( EPM) test was used to evaluate the effects of drugs on anxiety.	[]
METHODS: Adult male Swiss Webster mice ( 25 - 32 g) were given nicotine ( 0. 05 - 0. 25 mg / kg s. c.) or saline 10 min before caffeine ( 70 mg / kg i. p.) or pentylenetetrazole ( 15 and 30 mg / kg i. p.) injections.

After 15 min, mice were evaluated for their open - and closed - arm time and entries on the EPM for a 10 - min session.	[]
Locomotor activity was recorded for individual groups by using the same treatment protocol with the EPM test.	[]
RESULTS: Nicotine ( 0. 05 - 0. 25 mg / kg) itself did not produce any significant effect in the EPM test, whereas caffeine ( 70 mg / kg) and pentylenetetrazole ( 30 mg / kg) produced an anxiogenic effect, apparent with decreases in open - arm time and entry.

Administration of each drug and their combinations did not produce any effect on locomotor activity.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the antagonistic effect of nicotine on caffeine - induced anxiety is specific to caffeine, instead of a non - specific anxiolytic effect.

Long term hormone therapy for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.	[]
BACKGROUND: Hormone therapy ( HT) is widely used for controlling menopausal symptoms.	[]
It has also been used for the management and prevention of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and dementia in older women but the evidence supporting its use for these indications is largely observational.	[]
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of long - term HT on mortality, heart disease, venous thromboembolism, stroke, transient ischaemic attacks, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, gallbladder disease, cognitive function, dementia, fractures and quality of life.	[]
SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the following databases up to November 2004: the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biological Abstracts.	[]
Relevant non - indexed journals and conference abstracts were also searched.	[]
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised double - blind trials of HT ( oestrogens with or without progestogens) versus placebo, taken for at least one year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women.	"oestrogens	61	71	Chemical/Drug"	"progestogens	88	100	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""oestrogens"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""progestogens"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Fifteen RCTs were included.	[]
Trials were assessed for quality and two review authors extracted data independently.	[]
They calculated risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes.	[]
Clinical heterogeneity precluded meta - analysis for most outcomes.	[]
MAIN RESULTS: All the statistically significant results were derived from the two biggest trials.	[]
In relatively healthy women, combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thromboembolism or coronary event ( after one year ' s use), stroke ( after 3 years), breast cancer ( after 5 years) and gallbladder disease.	[]
Long - term oestrogen - only HT also significantly increased the risk of stroke and gallbladder disease.	"oestrogen	12	21	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""oestrogen"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Overall, the only statistically significant benefits of HT were a decreased incidence of fractures and colon cancer with long - term use.	[]
Among relatively healthy women over 65 years taking continuous combined HT, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of dementia.	[]
Among women with cardiovascular disease, long - term use of combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thromboembolism.	[]
No trials focussed specifically on younger women.	[]
However, one trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy 50 to 59 year - old women taking combined continuous HT and 1637 taking oestrogen - only HT, versus similar - sized placebo groups.	"oestrogen	137	146	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""oestrogen"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The only significantly increased risk reported was for venous thromboembolism in women taking combined continuous HT; their absolute risk remained very low.	[]
AUTHORS ' CONCLUSIONS: HT is not indicated for the routine management of chronic disease.	[]
We need more evidence on the safety of HT for menopausal symptom control, though short - term use appears to be relatively safe for healthy younger women.	[]
Drug - induced liver injury: an analysis of 461 incidences submitted to the Spanish registry over a 10 - year period.	[]
BACKGROUND & AIMS: Progress in the understanding of susceptibility factors to drug - induced liver injury ( DILI) and outcome predictability are hampered by the lack of systematic programs to detect bona fide cases.	[]
METHODS: A cooperative network was created in 1994 in Spain to identify all suspicions of DILI following a prospective structured report form.	[]
The liver damage was characterized according to hepatocellular, cholestatic, and mixed laboratory criteria and to histologic criteria when available.	[]
Further evaluation of causality assessment was centrally performed.	[]
RESULTS: Since April 1994 to August 2004, 461 out of 570 submitted cases, involving 505 drugs, were deemed to be related to DILI.	[]
The antiinfective group of drugs was the more frequently incriminated, amoxicillin - clavulanate accounting for the 12. 8% of the whole series.	"amoxicillin - clavulanate	71	96	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""amoxicillin - clavulanate"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The hepatocellular pattern of damage was the most common ( 58%), was inversely correlated with age ( P <. 0001), and had the worst outcome ( Cox regression, P <. 034).	[]
Indeed, the incidence of liver transplantation and death in this group was 11. 7% if patients had jaundice at presentation, whereas the corresponding figure was 3. 8% in nonjaundiced patients ( P <. 04).	[]
Factors associated with the development of fulminant hepatic failure were female sex ( OR = 25; 95% CI: 4. 1 - 151; P <. 0001), hepatocellular damage ( OR = 7. 9; 95% CI: 1. 6 - 37; P <. 009), and higher baseline plasma bilirubin value ( OR = 1. 15; 95% CI: 1. 09 - 1. 22; P <. 0001).	"bilirubin	220	229	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""bilirubin"", ""start_span"": 220, ""end_span"": 229, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with drug - induced hepatocellular jaundice have 11. 7% chance of progressing to death or transplantation.	[]

There is now evidence to suggest a central role for the dopaminergic system in restless legs syndrome ( RLS).	[]
For example, the symptoms of RLS can be dramatically improved by levodopa and dopamine agonists, whereas central dopamine D2 receptor antagonists can induce or aggravate RLS symptoms.

To our knowledge, there is no previous report regarding whether domperidone, a peripheral dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, can also induce or aggravate symptoms of RLS.

Mirtazapine, the first noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant ( NaSSA), has been associated with RLS in several recent publications.	"Mirtazapine	0	11	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Mirtazapine"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The authors report here a depressed patient comorbid with postprandial dyspepsia who developed RLS after mirtazapine had been added to his domperidone therapy.

Our patient started to have symptoms of RLS only after he had been treated with mirtazapine, and his RLS symptoms resolved completely upon discontinuation of his mirtazapine.

Such a temporal relationship between the use of mirtazapine and the symptoms of RLS in our patient did not support a potentiating effect of domperione on mirtazapine - associated RLS.

The patient, who had unresectable colon cancer metastases to the liver and lung, was referred to us for chemotherapy from an affiliated hospital; he had no cardiac history.	[]

Instead, oral administration of S - 1 ( a derivative of 5 - FU), at 200 mg / day twice a week, was instituted, because S - 1 has a strong inhibitory effect on dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the degradative of 5 - FU into FBAL.

Because of the relatively short final half - life of monoHER ( about 30 min), it is expected that the time interval between monoHER and DOX might be of influence on the cardioprotective effect of monoHER.

The mean protective effect by adding monoHER before DOX led to a significant 4. 4 - fold reduction ( P < 0. 001, 95% CI 2. 3 - 8. 2) of abnormal cardiomyocytes.

However, serious adverse effects, including torsade de pointes ( Tdp), have been reported.	[]
METHODS AND RESULTS: Adverse effects of Bpd requiring discontinuation of treatment were evaluated.	"Bpd	40	43	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Bpd"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Bpd was administered to 459 patients ( 361 males, 63 + / - 12 years old) comprising 378 AF and 81 AFL cases.	"Bpd	0	3	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Bpd"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Mean left ventricular ejection fraction and atrial dimension ( LAD) were 66 + / - 11% and 40 + / - 6 mm, respectively.	[]
Adverse effects were observed in 19 patients ( 4%) during an average follow - up of 20 months.	[]
There was marked QT prolongation greater than 0. 55 s in 13 patients, bradycardia less than 40 beats / min in 6 patients, dizziness and general fatigue in 1 patient each.	[]
In 4 of 13 patients with QT prolongation, Tdp occurred.	[]
The major triggering factors of Tdp were hypokalemia and sudden decrease in heart rate.	[]
There were no differences in the clinical backgrounds of the patients with and without Tdp other than LAD and age, which were larger and older in the patients with Tdp.	[]
CONCLUSION: Careful observation of serum potassium concentration and the ECG should always be done during Bpd administration, particularly in elderly patients.

Enhanced isoproterenol - induced cardiac hypertrophy in transgenic rats with low brain angiotensinogen.	"isoproterenol	9	22	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""isoproterenol"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We have previously shown that a permanent deficiency in the brain renin - angiotensin system ( RAS) may increase the sensitivity of the baroreflex control of heart rate.	"angiotensin	74	85	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""angiotensin"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In this study we aimed at studying the involvement of the brain RAS in the cardiac reactivity to the beta - adrenoceptor ( beta - AR) agonist isoproterenol ( Iso).

Transgenic rats with low brain angiotensinogen ( TGR) were used.	[]
In isolated hearts, Iso induced a significantly greater increase in left ventricular ( LV) pressure and maximal contraction ( + dP / dt ( max)) in the TGR than in the Sprague - Dawley ( SD) rats.	"Iso	20	23	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Iso"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
LV hypertrophy induced by Iso treatment was significantly higher in TGR than in SD rats ( in g LV wt / 100 g body wt, 0. 28 + / - 0. 004 vs. 0. 24 + / - 0. 004, respectively).	"Iso	26	29	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Iso"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The greater LV hypertrophy in TGR rats was associated with more pronounced downregulation of beta - AR and upregulation of LV beta - AR kinase - 1 mRNA levels compared with those in SD rats.	[]
The decrease in the heart rate ( HR) induced by the beta - AR antagonist metoprolol in conscious rats was significantly attenuated in TGR compared with SD rats ( - 9. 9 + / - 1. 7% vs. - 18. 1 + / - 1. 5%), whereas the effect of parasympathetic blockade by atropine on HR was similar in both strains.

These results indicate that TGR are more sensitive to beta - AR agonist - induced cardiac inotropic response and hypertrophy, possibly due to chronically low sympathetic outflow directed to the heart.	[]

"methadone	73	82	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""methadone"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METHODS: We performed a systematic, retrospective study comparing active or former intravenous drug users receiving methadone and those not receiving methadone among all patients hospitalized over a 5 - year period in a tertiary care hospital.

A total of 167 patients receiving methadone fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were compared with a control group of 80 injection drug users not receiving methadone.

In addition to methadone dose, 15 demographic, biological, and pharmacological variables were considered as potential risk factors for QT prolongation.	"methadone	15	24	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""methadone"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
RESULTS: Among 167 methadone maintenance patients, the prevalence of QTc prolongation to 0. 50 second ( ( 1 / 2)) or longer was 16. 2% compared with 0% in 80 control subjects.	"methadone	19	28	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""methadone"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

These include augmented endothelin - 1 ( ET - 1) release, increased sympathetic nervous system activity, and elevated tissue oxidative stress.	[]
We hypothesized that increased venous smooth muscle ( venomotor) tone plays a role in Nomega - nitro - L - arginine ( LNNA) hypertension through these mechanisms.

Carotid arteries and vena cava were removed for measurement of isometric contraction.	[]
Maximal contraction to norepinephrine was modestly reduced in arteries from LNNA compared with control rats whereas the maximum contraction to ET - 1 was significantly reduced ( 54% control).

The superoxide scavenger tempol ( 30, 100, and 300 micromol kg ( - 1), IV) did not change arterial pressure in control rats but caused a dose - dependent decrease in LNNA rats ( - 18 + / - 8, - 26 + / - 15, and - 54 + / - 11 mm Hg).

Similarly, ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium caused a significantly greater fall in LNNA hypertensive rats ( 76 + / - 9 mm Hg) compared with control rats ( 35 + / - 10 mm Hg).

Carotid arteries, vena cava, and sympathetic ganglia from LNNA rats had higher basal levels of superoxide compared with those from control rats.

Association of DRD2 polymorphisms and chlorpromazine - induced extrapyramidal syndrome in Chinese schizophrenic patients.	"chlorpromazine	38	52	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""chlorpromazine"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
AIM: Extrapyramidal syndrome ( EPS) is most commonly affected by typical antipsychotic drugs that have a high affinity with the D2 receptor.	[]
Recently, many research groups have reported on the positive relationship between the genetic variations in the DRD2 gene and the therapeutic response in schizophrenia patients as a result of the role of variations in the receptor in modulating receptor expression.	[]
In this study, we evaluate the role DRD2 plays in chlorpromazine - induced EPS in schizophrenic patients.	"chlorpromazine	50	64	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""chlorpromazine"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METHODS: We identified seven SNP ( single nucleotide polymorphism) ( - 141Cins > del, TaqIB, TaqID, Ser311Cys, rs6275, rs6277 and TaqIA) in the DRD2 gene in 146 schizophrenic inpatients ( 59 with EPS and 87 without EPS according to the Simpson - Angus Scale) treated with chlorpromazine after 8 weeks.	"chlorpromazine	272	286	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""chlorpromazine"", ""start_span"": 272, ""end_span"": 286, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The alleles of all loci were determined by PCR ( polymerase chain reaction).	[]
RESULTS: Polymorphisms TaqID, Ser311Cys and rs6277 were not polymorphic in the population recruited in the present study.	[]
No statistical significance was found in the allele distribution of - 141Cins > del, TaqIB, rs6275 and TaqIA or in the estimated haplotypes ( constituted by TaqIB, rs6275 and TaqIA) in linkage disequilibrium between the two groups.	[]
CONCLUSION: Our results did not lend strong support to the view that the genetic variation of the DRD2 gene plays a major role in the individually variable adverse effect induced by chlorpromazine, at least in Chinese patients with schizophrenia.

Physical training decreases susceptibility to subsequent pilocarpine - induced seizures in the rat.	"pilocarpine	57	68	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""pilocarpine"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Regular motor activity has many benefits for mental and physical condition but its implications for epilepsy are still controversial.	[]
In order to elucidate this problem, we have studied the effect of long - term physical activity on susceptibility to subsequent seizures.	[]
Male Wistar rats were subjected to repeated training sessions in a treadmill and swimming pool.	[]
Thereafter, seizures were induced by pilocarpine injections in trained and non - trained control groups.	"pilocarpine	37	48	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""pilocarpine"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
During the acute period of status epilepticus, we measured: ( 1) the latency of the first motor sign, ( 2) the intensity of seizures, ( 3) the time when it occurred within the 6 - h observation period, and ( 4) the time when the acute period ended.	[]
All these behavioral parameters showed statistically significant changes suggesting that regular physical exercises decrease susceptibility to subsequently induced seizures and ameliorate the course of experimentally induced status epilepticus.	[]

We here probed how selective tonic dopaminergic stimulation affects associative learning.	[]
Forty healthy subjects were trained in a novel vocabulary of 45 concrete nouns over the course of 5 consecutive training days in a prospective, randomized, double - blind, placebo - controlled design.	[]
Subjects received the tonically stimulating dopamine - receptor agonist pergolide ( 0. 1 mg) vs placebo 120 min before training on each training day.

The dopamine agonist significantly impaired novel word learning compared to placebo.	"dopamine	4	12	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dopamine"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
This learning decrement persisted up to the last follow - up 4 weeks post - training.	[]

The extent of ' flattened ' affect with pergolide was related to the degree of learning inhibition.	"pergolide	40	49	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""pergolide"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
These findings suggest that tonic occupation of dopamine receptors impairs learning by competition with phasic dopamine signals.

This study was undertaken to evaluate the outcomes of liver transplantation for patients with hepatitis B virus ( HBV).	[]
METHODS: A retrospective chart analysis and a review of the organ transplant database identified 51 patients ( 43 men and 8 women) transplanted for benign HBV - related cirrhotic diseases between June 2002 and December 2004 who had survived more than 3 months.	[]
HBIg was administered intravenously during the first week and intramuscularly thereafter.	[]

The overall patient survival was 88. 3%, and 82. 4% after 1 and 2 years, respectively.	[]
A daily oral dose of 100 mg lamivudine for 2 weeks before transplantation for 10 patients enabled 57. 1% ( 4 / 7) and 62. 5% ( 5 / 8) of HBV - DNA and HBeAg positive patients respectively to convert to be negative.

Stereological methods reveal the robust size and stability of ectopic hilar granule cells after pilocarpine - induced status epilepticus in the adult rat.	"pilocarpine	96	107	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""pilocarpine"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Following status epilepticus in the rat, dentate granule cell neurogenesis increases greatly, and many of the new neurons appear to develop ectopically, in the hilar region of the hippocampal formation.	[]
It has been suggested that the ectopic hilar granule cells could contribute to the spontaneous seizures that ultimately develop after status epilepticus.	[]
However, the population has never been quantified, so it is unclear whether it is substantial enough to have a strong influence on epileptogenesis.	[]
To quantify this population, the total number of ectopic hilar granule cells was estimated using unbiased stereology at different times after pilocarpine - induced status epilepticus.	"pilocarpine	142	153	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""pilocarpine"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The number of hilar neurons immunoreactive for Prox - 1, a granule - cell - specific marker, was estimated using the optical fractionator method.	[]
The results indicate that the size of the hilar ectopic granule cell population after status epilepticus is substantial, and stable over time.	[]
Interestingly, the size of the population appears to be correlated with the frequency of behavioral seizures, because animals with more ectopic granule cells in the hilus have more frequent behavioral seizures.	[]
The hilar ectopic granule cell population does not appear to vary systematically across the septotemporal axis, although it is associated with an increase in volume of the hilus.	[]
The results provide new insight into the potential role of ectopic hilar granule cells in the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy.	"pilocarpine	94	105	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""pilocarpine"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

This had been apparently uncomplicated and she had maintained a remarkably high level of physical activity.	[]
She was found to be bradycardic at pre - operative assessment but had no cardiac symptoms.	[]
Second degree Mobitz type II atrioventricular block was diagnosed on electrocardiogram, and temporary transvenous ventricular pacing instituted in the peri - operative period.	[]
We discuss how evidence - based guidelines would not have been helpful in this case, and how chemotherapy can exhibit substantial cardiotoxicity that may develop over many years.	[]
We suggest that patients who have received chemotherapy at any time should have a pre - operative electrocardiogram even if they are asymptomatic.	[]

There was no further deterioration in the patient ' s condition during transport to hospital.	[]
There are very few documented case like this in the prehospital scientific literature.	[]
The cause appears to be the Bezold - Jarish reflex, stimulation of the ventricular walls which in turn decreases sympathetic outflow from the vasomotor centre.	[]

One day postlesion, the resting mean arterial pressure was significantly decreased in lesioned rats when compared with sham rats ( 100 + / - 7 versus 173 + / - 4 mm Hg, p less than 0. 05).	[]
Fifteen days later, the lesioned group still showed values significantly lower than the sham group ( 150 + / - 6 versus 167 + / - 5 mm Hg, p less than 0. 05).	[]
No significant heart rate differences were observed between the sham and lesioned groups.	[]
The ganglionic blocker trimethaphan ( 5 mg / kg i. v.) caused similar reductions in mean arterial pressure in both lesioned and sham groups.	"trimethaphan	23	35	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""trimethaphan"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Succimer chelation improves learning, attention, and arousal regulation in lead - exposed rats but produces lasting cognitive impairment in the absence of lead exposure.

BACKGROUND: There is growing pressure for clinicians to prescribe chelation therapy at only slightly elevated blood lead levels.	"lead	116	120	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""lead"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
However, very few studies have evaluated whether chelation improves cognitive outcomes in Pb - exposed children, or whether these agents have adverse effects that may affect brain development in the absence of Pb exposure.

OBJECTIVES: The present study was designed to answer these questions, using a rodent model of early childhood Pb exposure and treatment with succimer, a widely used chelating agent for the treatment of Pb poisoning.

RESULTS: Pb exposure produced lasting impairments in learning, attention, inhibitory control, and arousal regulation, paralleling the areas of dysfunction seen in Pb - exposed children.

Succimer treatment of the Pb - exposed rats significantly improved learning, attention, and arousal regulation, although the efficacy of the treatment varied as a function of the Pb exposure level and the specific functional deficit.

In contrast, succimer treatment of rats not previously exposed to Pb produced lasting and pervasive cognitive and affective dysfunction comparable in magnitude to that produced by the higher Pb exposure regimen.

CONCLUSIONS: These are the first data, to our knowledge, to show that treatment with any chelating agent can alleviate cognitive deficits due to Pb exposure.	"Pb	145	147	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Pb"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 147, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
These findings suggest that it may be possible to identify a succimer treatment protocol that improves cognitive outcomes in Pb - exposed children.

Caffeine challenge test in panic disorder and depression with panic attacks.	"Caffeine	0	8	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Caffeine"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Our aim was to observe if patients with panic disorder ( PD) and patients with major depression with panic attacks ( MDP) ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria) respond in a similar way to the induction of panic attacks by an oral caffeine challenge test.	"caffeine	274	282	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""caffeine"", ""start_span"": 274, ""end_span"": 282, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We randomly selected 29 patients with PD, 27 with MDP, 25 with major depression without panic attacks ( MD), and 28 healthy volunteers.	[]
The patients had no psychotropic drug for at least a 4 - week period.	[]
In a randomized double - blind experiment performed in 2 occasions 7 days apart, 480 mg caffeine and a caffeine - free ( placebo) solution were administered in a coffee form and anxiety scales were applied before and after each test.	"caffeine	88	96	Chemical/Drug"	"caffeine	88	96	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""caffeine"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""caffeine"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
A total of 58. 6% ( n = 17) of patients with PD, 44. 4% ( n = 12) of patients with MDP, 12. 0% ( n = 3) of patients with MD, and 7. 1% ( n = 2) of control subjects had a panic attack after the 480 - mg caffeine challenge test ( chi ( 2) ( 3) = 16. 22, P =. 001).	"caffeine	202	210	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""caffeine"", ""start_span"": 202, ""end_span"": 210, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Mitral annuloplasty as a ventricular restoration method for the failing left ventricle: a pilot study.	[]
BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Undersized mitral annuloplasty ( MAP) is effective in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and functional mitral regurgitation ( MR) since, as well as addressing the MR, the MAP may also reshape the dilated left ventricular ( LV) base.	[]
However, the direct benefits of this possible reshaping on LV function in the absence of underlying MR remain incompletely understood.	[]
The study aim was to identify these benefits in a canine model of acute heart failure.	[]
METHODS: Six dogs underwent MAP with a prosthetic band on the posterior mitral annulus, using four mattress sutures.	[]
The sutures were passed individually through four tourniquets and exteriorized untied via the left atriotomy.	[]
Sonomicrometry crystals were implanted around the mitral annulus and left ventricle to measure geometry and regional function.	[]
Acute heart failure was induced by propranolol and volume loading after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass; an absence of MR was confirmed by echocardiography.	"propranolol	35	46	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""propranolol"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
MAP was accomplished by cinching the tourniquets.	[]
Data were acquired at baseline, after induction of acute heart failure, and after MAP.	[]
RESULTS: MAP decreased mitral annular dimensions in both commissure - commissure and septal - lateral directions.	[]
Concomitantly, the diastolic diameter of the LV base and LV sphericity decreased ( i. e., improved) from 37. 4 + / - 9. 3 to 35. 9 + / - 10 mm ( p = 0. 063), and from 67. 9 + / - 18. 6% to 65. 3 + / - 18. 9% ( p = 0. 016), respectively.	[]
Decreases were evident in both LV end - diastolic pressure ( from 17 + / - 7 to 15 + / - 6 mmHg, p = 0. 0480 and Tau ( from 48 + / - 8 to 45 + / - 8 ms, p < 0. 01), while fractional shortening at the LV base increased from 7. 7 + / - 4. 5% to 9. 4 + / - 4. 5% ( p = 0. 045).	[]
After MAP, increases were identified in both cardiac output ( from 1. 54 + / - 0. 57 to 1. 65 + / - 0. 57 1 / min) and Emax ( from 1. 86 + / - 0. 9 to 2. 41 + / - 1. 31 mmHg / ml).	[]
CONCLUSION: The data acquired suggest that isolated MAP may have certain benefits on LV dimension / function in acute heart failure, even in the absence of MR.	[]
However, further investigations are warranted in a model of chronic heart failure.	[]

Frequency of transient ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia.	[]
BACKGROUND: Especially because of improvements in clinical neurologic monitoring, carotid endarterectomy done under local anesthesia has become the technique of choice in several centers.	[]
Temporary ipsilateral vocal nerve palsies due to local anesthetics have been described, however.	[]
Such complications are most important in situations where there is a pre - existing contralateral paralysis.	[]
We therefore examined the effect of local anesthesia on vocal cord function to better understand its possible consequences.	[]
METHODS: This prospective study included 28 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia.	[]
Vocal cord function was evaluated before, during, and after surgery ( postoperative day 1) using flexible laryngoscopy.	[]
Anesthesia was performed by injecting 20 to 40 mL of a mixture of long - acting ( ropivacaine) and short - acting ( prilocaine) anesthetic.	"ropivacaine	82	93	Chemical/Drug"	"prilocaine	116	126	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ropivacaine"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""prilocaine"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
RESULTS: All patients had normal vocal cord function preoperatively.	[]
Twelve patients ( 43%) were found to have intraoperative ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis.	[]
It resolved in all cases < or = 24 hours.	[]
There were no significant differences in operating time or volume or frequency of anesthetic administration in patients with temporary vocal cord paralysis compared with those without.	[]
CONCLUSION: Local anesthesia led to temporary ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis in almost half of these patients.	[]
Because pre - existing paralysis is of a relevant frequency ( up to 3%), a preoperative evaluation of vocal cord function before carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia is recommended to avoid intraoperative bilateral paralysis.	[]
In patients with preoperative contralateral vocal cord paralysis, surgery under general anesthesia should be considered.	[]
Impaired fear recognition in regular recreational cocaine users.	"cocaine	50	57	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cocaine"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three groups, comprised of 21 cocaine naive participants ( CN), 30 occasional cocaine ( OC), and 48 regular recreational cocaine ( RC) users, were compared.

An emotional facial expression ( EFE) task consisting of a male and female face expressing six basic emotions ( happiness, surprise, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust) was administered.	[]
Mean percent accuracy and latencies for correct responses across eight presentations of each basic emotion were derived.	[]
"Participants were also assessed with the "" Eyes task "" to investigate their ability to recognize more complex emotional states and the Symptom CheckList - 90 - Revised to measure psychopathology."	[]
"RESULTS: There were no group differences in psychopathology or "" eyes task "" performance, but the RC group, who otherwise had similar illicit substance use histories to the OC group, exhibited impaired fear recognition accuracy compared to the OC and CN groups."	[]
The RC group also correctly identified anger, fear, happiness, and surprise, more slowly than CN, but not OC participants.	[]
The OC group was slower than CN when correctly identifying disgust.	[]
The selective deficit in fear recognition accuracy manifested by the RC group cannot be explained by the subacute effects of cocaine, or ecstasy, because recent and less recent users of these drugs within this group were similarly impaired.	"cocaine	125	132	Chemical/Drug"	"ecstasy	137	144	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cocaine"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""ecstasy"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Possible parallels between RC users and psychopaths with respect to impaired fear recognition, amygdala dysfunction, and etiology are discussed.	[]
Damage of substantia nigra pars reticulata during pilocarpine - induced status epilepticus in the rat: immunohistochemical study of neurons, astrocytes and serum - protein extravasation.	"pilocarpine	50	61	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""pilocarpine"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The substantia nigra has a gating function controlling the spread of epileptic seizure activity.	[]
Additionally, in models of prolonged status epilepticus the pars reticulata of substantia nigra ( SNR) suffers from a massive lesion which may arise from a massive metabolic derangement and hyperexcitation developing in the activated SNR.	[]
In this study, status epilepticus was induced by systemic injection of pilocarpine in rats.	"pilocarpine	71	82	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""pilocarpine"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The neuropathology of SNR was investigated using immunohistochemical techniques with the major emphasis on the time - course of changes in neurons and astrocytes.	[]
Animals surviving 20, 30, 40, 60 min, 2, 3, 6 hours, 1, 2, and 3 days after induction of status epilepticus were perfusion - fixed, and brains processed for immunohistochemical staining of SNR.	[]
Nissl - staining and antibodies against the neuron - specific calcium - binding protein, parvalbumin, served to detect neuronal damage in SNR.	"calcium	62	69	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""calcium"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Antibodies against the astroglia - specific cytoskeletal protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP), and against the glial calcium - binding protein, S - 100 protein, were used to assess the status of astrocytes.	"calcium	129	136	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""calcium"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Immunohistochemical staining for serum - albumin and immunoglobulins in brain tissue was taken as indicator of blood - brain barrier disturbances and vasogenic edema formation.	[]
Immunohistochemical staining indicated loss of GFAP - staining already at 30 min after induction of seizures in an oval focus situated in the center of SNR while sparing medial and lateral aspects.	[]
At 1 h there was additional vacuolation in S - 100 protein staining.	[]
By 2 hours, parvalbumin - staining changed in the central SNR indicating neuronal damage, and Nissl - staining visualized some neuronal distortion.	[]
Staining for serum - proteins occurred in a patchy manner throughout the forebrain during the first hours.	[]
By 6 h, vasogenic edema covered the lesioned SNR.	[]
By 24 h, glial and neuronal markers indicated a massive lesion in the center of SNR.	[]
By 48 - 72 h, astrocytes surrounding the lesion increased in size, and polymorphic phagocytotic cells invaded the damaged area.	[]
In a further group of animals surviving 1 to 5 days, conventional paraffin - sections confirmed the neuronal and glial damage of SNR.	[]
Additional pathology of similar quality was found in the globus pallidus.	[]
Since astrocytes were always damaged in parallel with neurons in SNR it is proposed that the anatomical and functional interrelationship between neurons and astrocytes is particularly tight in SNR.	[]
Both cell elements may suffer in common from metabolic disturbance and neurotransmitter dysfunction as occur during massive status epilepticus.	[]

PURPOSE: We report 4 cases of corneal ulcers associated with drug abuse.	[]
The pathogenesis of these ulcers and management of these patients are also reviewed.	[]
METHODS: Review of all cases of corneal ulcers associated with drug abuse seen at our institution from July 2006 to December 2006.	[]
RESULTS: Four patients with corneal ulcers associated with crack cocaine use were reviewed.	"crack cocaine	59	72	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""crack cocaine"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
All corneal ulcers were cultured, and the patients were admitted to the hospital for intensive topical antibiotic treatment.	[]
Each patient received comprehensive health care, including medical and substance abuse consultations.	[]
Streptococcal organisms were found in 3 cases and Capnocytophaga and Brevibacterium casei in 1 patient.	[]
The infections responded to antibiotic treatment.	[]
Two patients needed a lateral tarsorrhaphy for persistent epithelial defects.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: Aerosolized crack cocaine use can be associated with the development of corneal ulcers.	"crack cocaine	25	38	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""crack cocaine"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Drug abuse provides additional challenges for management.	[]
Not only treatment of their infections but also the overall poor health of the patients and increased risk of noncompliance need to be addressed.	[]
Comprehensive care may provide the patient the opportunity to discontinue their substance abuse, improve their overall health, and prevent future corneal complications.	[]

In order to evaluate the efficacy, time - course of action and predictors of response to topical capsaicin, 39 patients with chronic post - herpetic neuralgia ( PHN), median duration 24 months, were treated with 0. 025% capsaicin cream for 8 weeks.

During therapy the patients rated their pain on a visual analogue scale ( VAS) and a verbal outcome scale.	[]
A follow - up investigation was performed 10 - 12 months after study onset on the patients who had improved.	[]
Nineteen patients ( 48. 7%) substantially improved after the 8 - week trial; 5 ( 12. 8%) discontinued therapy due to side - effects such as intolerable capsaicin - induced burning sensations ( 4) or mastitis ( 1); 15 ( 38. 5%) reported no benefit.

The decrease in VAS ratings was significant after 2 weeks of continuous application.	[]
Of the responders 72. 2% were still improved at the follow - up; only one - third of them had continued application irregularly.	[]
Treatment effect was not dependent on patient ' s age, duration or localization of PHN ( trigeminal involvement was excluded), sensory disturbance or pain character.	[]
Treatment response was not correlated with the incidence, time - course or severity of capsaicin - induced burning.	"capsaicin	87	96	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""capsaicin"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
If confirmed in controlled trials, the long - term results of this open, non - randomized study might indicate that the analgesic effect of capsaicin in PHN is mediated by both interference with neuropeptide metabolism and morphological changes ( perhaps degeneration) of nociceptive afferents.

Non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs - associated acute interstitial nephritis with granular tubular basement membrane deposits.	[]
Acute tubulo - interstitial nephritis ( ATIN) is an important cause of acute renal failure resulting from a variety of insults, including immune complex - mediated tubulo - interstitial injury, but drugs such as non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) are a far more frequent cause.	[]
Overall, as an entity, ATIN remains under - diagnosed, as symptoms resolve spontaneously if the medication is stopped.	[]
We report on a 14 - year - old boy who developed acute renal failure 2 weeks after aortic valve surgery.	[]

Oral mucosal biopsies were taken before surgery and 48 h after surgery.	[]
After extraction, a microdialysis probe was placed at the surgical site for PGE2 and thromboxane B2 ( TXB2) measurements.

RESULTS: The bupivacaine / rofecoxib group reported significantly less pain, as assessed by a visual analog scale, compared with the other three treatment groups over the first 4 h.

Moreover, bupivacaine significantly increased COX - 2 gene expression at 48 h as compared with the lidocaine / placebo group.	"bupivacaine	10	21	Chemical/Drug"	"lidocaine	99	108	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""bupivacaine"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""lidocaine"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Thromboxane levels were not significantly affected by any of the treatments, indicating that the effects seen were attributable to inhibition of COX - 2, but not COX - 1.	"Thromboxane	0	11	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Thromboxane"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that bupivacaine stimulates COX - 2 gene expression after tissue injury, which is associated with higher PGE2 production and pain after the local anesthetic effect dissipates.

A role for nerve growth factor ( NGF) in contributing to increased voiding frequency and altered sensation from the urinary bladder has been suggested.	[]
Previous studies have examined the expression and regulation of tyrosine kinase receptors ( Trks) in micturition reflexes with urinary bladder inflammation.	"tyrosine	64	72	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""tyrosine"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The present studies examine the expression and regulation of another receptor known to bind NGF, p75 ( NTR), after various durations of bladder inflammation induced by cyclophosphamide ( CYP).	"cyclophosphamide	168	184	Chemical/Drug"	"CYP	187	190	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cyclophosphamide"", ""start_span"": 168, ""end_span"": 184, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""CYP"", ""start_span"": 187, ""end_span"": 190, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
CYP - induced cystitis increased ( P < or = 0. 001) p75 ( NTR) expression in the superficial lateral and medial dorsal horn in L1 - L2 and L6 - S1 spinal segments.	"CYP	0	3	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""CYP"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The number of p75 ( NTR) - immunoreactive ( - IR) cells in the lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia ( DRG) also increased ( P < or = 0. 05) with CYP - induced cystitis ( acute, intermediate, and chronic).	"CYP	140	143	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""CYP"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Quantitative, real - time polymerase chain reaction also demonstrated significant increases ( P < or = 0. 01) in p75 ( NTR) mRNA in DRG with intermediate and chronic CYP - induced cystitis.	"CYP	166	169	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""CYP"", ""start_span"": 166, ""end_span"": 169, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Retrograde dye - tracing techniques with Fastblue were used to identify presumptive bladder afferent cells in the lumbosacral DRG.	[]
In bladder afferent cells in DRG, p75 ( NTR) - IR was also increased ( P < or = 0. 01) with cystitis.	[]
In addition to increases in p75 ( NTR) - IR in DRG cell bodies, increases ( P < or = 0. 001) in pericellular ( encircling DRG cells) p75 ( NTR) - IR in DRG also increased.	[]
Confocal analyses demonstrated that pericellular p75 ( NTR) - IR was not colocalized with the glial marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP).	[]
These studies demonstrate that p75 ( NTR) expression in micturition reflexes is present constitutively and modified by bladder inflammation.	[]
The functional significance of p75 ( NTR) expression in micturition reflexes remains to be determined.	[]

BACKGROUND: Azathioprine is widely used as an immunosuppressive drug.	"Azathioprine	12	24	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Azathioprine"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The side effects of azathioprine include anemia, which has been attributed to bone marrow suppression.	"azathioprine	20	32	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""azathioprine"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Alternatively, anemia could result from accelerated suicidal erythrocyte death or eryptosis, which is characterized by exposure of phosphatidylserine ( PS) at the erythrocyte surface and by cell shrinkage.

METHODS: The present experiments explored whether azathioprine influences eryptosis.	"azathioprine	50	62	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""azathioprine"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
According to annexin V binding, erythrocytes from patients indeed showed a significant increase of PS exposure within 1 week of treatment with azathioprine.

RESULTS: Exposure to azathioprine ( > or = 2 microg / mL) for 48 hours increased cytosolic Ca2 + activity and annexin V binding and decreased forward scatter.	"azathioprine	21	33	Chemical/Drug"	"Ca2	91	94	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""azathioprine"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""Ca2"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The effect of azathioprine on both annexin V binding and forward scatter was significantly blunted in the nominal absence of extracellular Ca2 +.

Antidepressants have previously been associated with paranoid reactions in psychiatric patients.	[]
Five cases of paranoid exacerbation with the serotonin reuptake inhibitors fluoxetine and amitriptyline are reported here.

Elements common to these cases included a history of paranoid symptomatology and the concomitant occurrence of depressive and psychotic symptoms.	[]
Complicated depressive disorders ( including atypicality of course and symptomatology, chronicity, psychosis, bipolarity, and secondary onset in the course of a primary psychosis) may present particular vulnerability to paranoid exacerbations associated with serotonin reuptake inhibitors.	"serotonin	259	268	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""serotonin"", ""start_span"": 259, ""end_span"": 268, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Although the pharmacology and neurobiology of paranoia remain cryptic, several mechanisms, including 5HT3 receptor - mediated dopamine release, beta - noradrenergic receptor downregulation, or GABAB receptor upregulation acting in the vicinity of the ventral basal ganglia ( possibly in lateral orbitofrontal or anterior cingulate circuits), might apply to this phenomenon.	"dopamine	126	134	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dopamine"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
These cases call attention to possible paranoid exacerbations with serotonin reuptake blockers in select patients and raise neurobiological considerations regarding paranoia.

Clinical comparison of cardiorespiratory effects during unilateral and conventional spinal anaesthesia.	[]
BACKGROUND: Spinal anaesthesia is widely employed in clinical practice but has the main drawback of post - spinal block hypotension.	[]
Efforts must therefore continue to be made to obviate this setback OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cardiovascular and respiratory changes during unilateral and conventional spinal anaesthesia.	[]
METHODS: With ethical approval, we studied 74 American Society of Anesthesiologists ( ASA), physical status class 1 and 2 patients scheduled for elective unilateral lower limb surgery.	[]
Patients were randomly allocated into one of two groups: lateral and conventional spinal anaesthesia groups.	[]
In the lateral position with operative side down, patients recived 10 mg ( 2mls) of 0. 5% hyperbaric bupivacaine through a 25 - gauge spinal needle.	"bupivacaine	101	112	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""bupivacaine"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Patients in the unilateral group were maintained in the lateral position for 15 minutes following spinal injection while those in the conventional group were turned supine immediately after injection.	[]

One patient showed no changes in SAP amplitude.	[]
Five patients complained of paresthesias and leg cramps.	[]
After thalidomide treatment, sural SAP amplitude recovered in 3 patients.	"thalidomide	6	17	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""thalidomide"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
At detection of reduction in sural nerve SAP amplitude, the median thalidomide cumulative dose was 21. 4 g.	"thalidomide	67	78	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""thalidomide"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

CONCLUSIONS: Sural nerve SAP amplitude reduction is a reliable and sensitive marker of degeneration and recovery of sensory fibres.	[]
This electrophysiological parameter provides information about subclinical neurotoxic potential of thalidomide but is not helpful in predicting the appearance of sensory symptoms.

Two cases had a fatal outcome and one resulted in severe sequelae.	[]
The notable fact was that this complication occurred in three patients hospitalized before treatment began, with whom particularly strict therapeutic precautions were taken, i. e., initial dose less than 10 mg of DEC, very gradual dose increases, and associated anti - allergic treatment.

This type of drug - induced complication may not be that uncommon in highly endemic regions.	[]
It occurs primarily, but not exclusively, in subjects presenting with a high microfilarial load.	[]
The relationship between the occurrence of encephalitis and the decrease in microfilaremia is evident.	[]
The pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed in the light of these observations and the few other comments on this subject published in the literature.	[]

Amiodarone is an anti - arrhythmic drug for life - threatening tachycardia, but various adverse effects have been reported.	"Amiodarone	0	10	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Amiodarone"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Reported herein is an autopsy case of valvular heart disease, in a patient who developed a lung mass ( 1. 5 cm in diameter) and proteinuria ( 2. 76 g / day) after treatment with amiodarone for a long time.

The lung mass was highly suspected to be lung cancer on CT and positron emission tomography, but histologically the lesion was composed of lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates in alveolar walls and intra - alveolar accumulation of foamy macrophages containing characteristic myelinoid bodies, indicating that it was an amiodarone - related lesion.

In addition, the lung tissue had unevenly distributed hemosiderin deposition, and abnormally tortuous capillaries were seen in the mass and in heavily hemosiderotic lung portions outside the mass.	[]
In the kidneys, glomeruli had membrane spikes, prominent swelling of podocytes and subepithelial deposits, which were sometimes large and hump - like.	[]
Autoimmune diseases, viral hepatitis, malignant neoplasms or other diseases with a known relationship to membranous glomerulonephritis were not found.	[]
The present case highlights the possibility that differential diagnosis between an amiodarone - related pulmonary lesion and a neoplasm can be very difficult radiologically, and suggests that membranous glomerulonephritis might be another possible complication of amiodarone treatment.

METHODS: Perioperative data from consecutive cardiac surgery patients were prospectively collected between September 2005 and June 2006 in a university - affiliated clinic ( n = 1188).	[]
During the first 5 mo, 596 patients received aprotinin ( Group A); in the next 5 mo, 592 patients were treated with tranexamic acid ( Group T).	"tranexamic acid	116	131	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""tranexamic acid"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Except for antifibrinolytic therapy, the anesthetic and surgical protocols remained unchanged.	[]
RESULTS: The pre - and intraoperative variables were comparable between the treatment groups.	[]
Postoperatively, a significantly higher incidence of seizures was found in Group T ( 4. 6% vs 1. 2%, P < 0. 001).	[]
This difference was also significant in the primary valve surgery and the high risk surgery subgroups ( 7. 9% vs 1. 2%, P = 0. 003; 7. 3% vs 2. 4%, P = 0. 035, respectively).	[]
Persistent atrial fibrillation ( 7. 9% vs 2. 3%, P = 0. 020) and renal failure ( 9. 7% vs 1. 7%, P = 0. 002) were also more common in Group T, in the primary valve surgery subgroup.	[]
On the contrary, among primary coronary artery bypass surgery patients, there were more acute myocardial infarctions and renal dysfunction in Group A ( 5. 8% vs 2. 0%, P = 0. 027; 22. 5% vs 15. 2%, P = 0. 036, respectively).	[]
The 1 - yr mortality was significantly higher after aprotinin treatment in the high risk surgery group ( 17. 7% vs 9. 8%, P = 0. 034).	[]
CONCLUSION: Both antifibrinolytic drugs bear the risk of adverse outcome depending on the type of cardiac surgery.	[]
Administration of aprotinin should be avoided in coronary artery bypass graft and high risk patients, whereas administration of tranexamic acid is not recommended in valve surgery.

Preventive Services Task Force.	[]
BACKGROUND: Coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease are leading causes of death in the United States.	[]
In 2002, the U. S.	[]
Preventive Services Task Force ( USPSTF) strongly recommended that clinicians discuss aspirin with adults who are at increased risk for coronary heart disease.	"aspirin	86	93	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""aspirin"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
PURPOSE: To determine the benefits and harms of taking aspirin for the primary prevention of myocardial infarctions, strokes, and death.	"aspirin	55	62	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""aspirin"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE and Cochrane Library ( search dates, 1 January 2001 to 28 August 2008), recent systematic reviews, reference lists of retrieved articles, and suggestions from experts.	[]
STUDY SELECTION: English - language randomized, controlled trials ( RCTs); case - control studies; meta - analyses; and systematic reviews of aspirin versus control for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease ( CVD) were selected to answer the following questions: Does aspirin decrease coronary heart events, strokes, death from coronary heart events or stroke, or all - cause mortality in adults without known CVD?

The objective of this review is to summarize practical considerations of argatroban therapy in HIT.	"argatroban	73	83	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""argatroban"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The US FDA - recommended argatroban dose in HIT is 2 microg / kg / min ( reduced in patients with hepatic impairment and in paediatric patients), adjusted to achieve activated partial thromboplastin times ( aPTTs) 1. 5 - 3 times baseline ( not > 100 seconds).	"argatroban	25	35	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""argatroban"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Contemporary experiences indicate that reduced doses are also needed in patients with conditions associated with hepatic hypoperfusion, e. g. heart failure, yet are unnecessary for renal dysfunction, adult age, sex, race / ethnicity or obesity.	[]
Argatroban 0. 5 - 1. 2 microg / kg / min typically supports therapeutic aPTTs.	"Argatroban	0	10	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Argatroban"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The FDA - recommended dose during PCI is 25 microg / kg / min ( 350 microg / kg initial bolus), adjusted to achieve activated clotting times ( ACTs) of 300 - 450 sec.	[]
For PCI, argatroban has not been investigated in hepatically impaired patients; dose adjustment is unnecessary for adult age, sex, race / ethnicity or obesity, and lesser doses may be adequate with concurrent glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibition.

Liver transplantation for acutely ill patients with fulminant liver failure carries high intraoperative and immediate postoperative risks.	[]
These are increased with the presence of concomitant acute kidney injury ( AKI) and intraoperative dialysis is sometimes required to allow the transplant to proceed.	[]
The derangements in the procoagulant and anticoagulant pathways during fulminant liver failure can lead to difficulties with anticoagulation during dialysis, especially when continued in the operating room.	[]
Systemic anticoagulation is unsafe and regional citrate anticoagulation in the absence of a functional liver carries the risk of citrate toxicity.

Primary objective was overall response rate ( ORR).	[]
Analyses of markers associated with the mTOR pathway were carried out on archival tumor from a subgroup using immunohistochemistry ( IHC) and direct mutation sequencing.	[]
RESULTS: Eighty - five patients were enrolled, 42 in stratum 1 and 43 in stratum.	[]
ORR was 4. 7% ( 7. 1% stratum 1; 2. 3% stratum 2).	[]
Overall disease control rate was 47. 1%.	[]
Median progression - free survivals ( PFSs) were 2. 6 ( stratum 1) and 2. 7 months ( stratum 2).	[]
Common > or = grade 3 events were fatigue, dyspnea, stomatitis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.	[]
Pneumonitis, probably or possibly related, mainly grade 1 / 2, occurred in 25%.	[]
Cox regression analysis of IHC scores found that only phospho AKT ( pAKT) was a significant independent predictor of worse PFS.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: RAD001 10 mg / day was well tolerated, showing modest clinical activity in pretreated NSCLC.	"RAD001	13	19	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""RAD001"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

"cocaine	20	27	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cocaine"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
It is unclear whether a coronary CTA strategy would be efficacious in cocaine - associated chest pain, as coronary vasospasm may account for some of the ischemia.	"cocaine	70	77	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cocaine"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We studied whether a negative coronary CTA in patients with cocaine - associated chest pain could identify a subset safe for discharge.	"cocaine	60	67	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cocaine"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METHODS: We prospectively evaluated the safety of coronary CTA for low - risk patients who presented to the ED with cocaineassociated chest pain ( self - reported or positive urine test).	[]
Consecutive patients received either immediate coronary CTA in the ED ( without serial markers) or underwent coronary CTA after a brief observation period with serial cardiac marker measurements.	[]
Patients with negative coronary CTA ( maximal stenosis less than 50%) were discharged.	[]
The main outcome was 30 - day cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction.	[]
RESULTS: A total of 59 patients with cocaine - associated chest pain were evaluated.	"cocaine	37	44	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cocaine"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Patients had a mean age of 45. 6 + / - 6. 6 yrs and were 86% black, 66% male.	[]
Seventy - nine percent had a normal or nonspecific ECG and 85% had a TIMI score < 2.	[]
Twenty patients received coronary CTA immediately in the ED, 18 of whom were discharged following CTA ( 90%).	[]
Thirty - nine received coronary CTA after a brief observation period, with 37 discharged home following CTA ( 95%).	[]
Six patients had coronary stenosis > or = 50%.	[]
During the 30 - day follow - up period, no patients died of a cardiovascular event ( 0%; 95% CI, 0 - 6. 1%) and no patient sustained a nonfatal myocardial infarction ( 0%; 95% CI, 0 - 6. 1%).	[]
CONCLUSIONS: Although cocaine - associated myocardial ischemia can result from coronary vasoconstriction, patients with cocaine associated chest pain, a non - ischemic ECG, and a TIMI risk score < 2 may be safely discharged from the ED after a negative coronary CTA with a low risk of 30 - day adverse events.

Late fulminant posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome after liver transplant.	[]
OBJECTIVES: Posterior leukoencephalopathy due to calcineurin - inhibitor - related neurotoxicity is a rare but severe complication that results from treatment with immunosuppressive agents ( primarily those administered after a liver or kidney transplant).	[]
The pathophysiologic mechanisms of that disorder remain unknown.	[]
CASE: We report the case of a 46 - year - old woman who received a liver transplant in our center as treatment for alcoholic cirrhosis and in whom either a fulminant course of posterior leukoencephalopathy or posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome developed 110 days after transplant.	[]
After an initially uneventful course after the transplant, the patient rapidly fell into deep coma.	[]
RESULTS: Cerebral MRI scan showed typical signs of enhancement in the pontine and posterior regions.	[]
Switching the immunosuppressive regimen from tacrolimus to cyclosporine did not improve the clinical situation.

BACKGROUND: Little is known about the possible role that smoking crack cocaine has on the incidence of HIV infection.	"crack cocaine	65	78	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""crack cocaine"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Given the increasing use of crack cocaine, we sought to examine whether use of this illicit drug has become a risk factor for HIV infection.	"crack cocaine	28	41	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""crack cocaine"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METHODS: We included data from people participating in the Vancouver Injection Drug Users Study who reported injecting illicit drugs at least once in the month before enrolment, lived in the greater Vancouver area, were HIV - negative at enrolment and completed at least 1 follow - up study visit.

Cancer patients who have been treated with systemic adjuvant chemotherapy have described experiencing deteriorations in cognition.	[]
A widely used chemotherapeutic agent, 5 - fluorouracil ( 5 - FU), readily crosses the blood - brain barrier and so could have a direct effect on brain function.

We have recently demonstrated that disruption of extracellular matrix ( ECM) / integrin signaling via elimination of integrin - linked kinase ( ILK) in hepatocytes interferes with signals leading to termination of liver regeneration.	[]

In the hepatocyte - specific ILK / liver - / - mice, the liver: body weight ratio was more than double as compared to 0 h at day 2 ( 2. 5 times), while at days 5 and 10, it was enlarged three times.	[]
In the WT mice, the increase was as expected from previous literature ( 1. 8 times) and seems to have leveled off after day 2.	[]
There were slightly increased proliferating cell nuclear antigen - positive cells in the ILK / liver - / - animals at day 2 as compared to WT after PB administration.	"PB	148	150	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""PB"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In the WT animals, the proliferative response had come back to normal by days 5 and 10.	[]
Hepatocytes of the ILK / liver - / - mice continued to proliferate up until day 10.	[]
ILK / liver - / - mice also showed increased expression of key genes involved in hepatocyte proliferation at different time points during PB administration.	"PB	138	140	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""PB"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In summary, ECM proteins communicate with the signaling machinery of dividing cells via ILK to regulate hepatocyte proliferation and termination of the proliferative response.	[]
Lack of ILK in the hepatocytes imparts prolonged proliferative response not only to stimuli related to liver regeneration but also to xenobiotic chemical mitogens, such as PB.	"PB	172	174	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""PB"", ""start_span"": 172, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation occurs after seizures and is implicated in epileptogenesis.	[]
CCR2 is a chemokine receptor for CCL2 and their interaction mediates monocyte infiltration in the neuroinflammatory cascade triggered in different brain pathologies.	[]
In this work CCR2 and CCL2 expression were examined following status epilepticus ( SE) induced by pilocarpine injection.	"pilocarpine	98	109	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""pilocarpine"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Five days after SE, CCR2 staining in neurons and glial cells was examined using imunohistochemical analyses.	[]
The number of CCR2 positive cells was determined using stereology probes in the hippocampus.	[]
CCL2 expression in the hippocampus was examined by molecular assay.	[]
RESULTS: Increased CCR2 was observed in the hippocampus after SE.	[]
Seizures also resulted in alterations to the cell types expressing CCR2.	[]
Increased numbers of neurons that expressed CCR2 was observed following SE.	[]
Microglial cells were more closely apposed to the CCR2 - labeled cells in SE rats.	[]
In addition, rats that experienced SE exhibited CCR2 - labeling in populations of hypertrophied astrocytes, especially in CA1 and dentate gyrus.	[]
These CCR2 + astroctytes were not observed in control rats.	[]
Examination of CCL2 expression showed that it was elevated in the hippocampus following SE.	[]
CONCLUSION: The data show that CCR2 and CCL2 are up - regulated in the hippocampus after pilocarpine - induced SE.	"pilocarpine	89	100	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""pilocarpine"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Also, BCNU administration increased serum tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( TNFalpha), hippocampal MT and malondialdehyde ( MDA) contents as well as caspase - 3 activity in addition to histological alterations.

ZnSO ( 4) pretreatment counteracted BCNU - induced inhibition of GR and depletion of GSH and resulted in significant reduction in the levels of MDA and TNFalpha as well as the activity of caspase - 3.

OBJECTIVES: Neuropsychiatric symptoms are increasingly recognised as a significant problem in patients with Parkinson ' s disease ( PD).	[]
These symptoms may be due to ' sensitisation ' following repeated levodopa treatment or a direct effect of dopamine on the disease state.	"levodopa	66	74	Chemical/Drug"	"dopamine	107	115	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""levodopa"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""dopamine"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

METHODS: Marmosets were administered 1 - methyl - 4 - phenyl - 1, 2, 3, 6 - tetrahydropyridine ( 2. 0 mg / kg s. c.) for five days, resulting in stable parkinsonism.	[]
Levodopa ( 15 mg / kg and benserazide, 3. 75 mg / kg) p. o.

b. i. d, was administered for 30 days.	[]
Animals were evaluated for parkinsonian disability, dyskinesia and on - time ( motor fluctuations) and neuropsychiatric - like behaviors on Day 0 ( prior to levodopa) and on Days 1, 7, 13, 27 and 30 of treatment using post hoc DVD analysis by a trained rater, blind to the treatment day.	"levodopa	157	165	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""levodopa"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 165, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
RESULTS: The neuropsychiatric - like behavior rating scale demonstrated high interrater reliability between three trained raters of differing professional backgrounds.	[]
As anticipated, animals exhibited a progressive increase in levodopa - induced motor fluctuations, dyskinesia and wearing - off, that correlated with the duration of levodopa therapy.

PURPOSE: To compare the susceptibility to nephrotoxic effect of CM in patients undergoing PTRA with that of patients submitted to percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI).	"CM	64	66	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""CM"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 33 patients successfully treated with PTRA ( PTRA group, mean age 70 + / - 12 years, 23 female, basal creatinine 1. 46 + / - 0. 79, range 0. 7 - 4. 9 mg / dl) were compared with 33 patients undergoing successful PCI ( PCI group), matched for basal creatinine ( 1. 44 + / - 0. 6, range 0. 7 - 3. 4 mg / dl), gender, and age.

In both groups postprocedural ( 48 h) serum creatinine was measured.	"creatinine	44	54	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""creatinine"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
RESULTS: Postprocedural creatinine level decreased nonsignificantly in the PTRA group ( 1. 46 + / - 0. 8 vs. 1. 34 + / - 0. 5 mg / dl, P = NS) and increased significantly in the PCI group ( 1. 44 + / - 0. 6 vs. 1. 57 + / - 0. 7 mg / dl, P < 0. 02).	"creatinine	24	34	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""creatinine"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Changes in serum creatinine after intervention ( after - before) were significantly different between the PTRA and PCI groups ( - 0. 12 + / - 0. 5 vs. 0. 13 + / - 0. 3, P = 0. 014).	"creatinine	17	27	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""creatinine"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
This difference was not related to either a different clinical risk profile or to the volume of CM administered.	"CM	96	98	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""CM"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
CONCLUSION: In this preliminary study patients submitted to PTRA showed a lower susceptibility to renal damage induced by CM administration than PCI patients.	"CM	122	124	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""CM"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The effectiveness of PTRA on renal function seems to be barely influenced by CM toxicity.	"CM	77	79	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""CM"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Diphenhydramine prevents the haemodynamic changes of cimetidine in ICU patients.

Cimetidine, a histamine 2 ( H2) antagonist, produces a decrease in arterial pressure due to vasodilatation, especially in critically ill patients.	"Cimetidine	0	10	Chemical/Drug"	"histamine	14	23	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Cimetidine"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""histamine"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
This may be because cimetidine acts as a histamine agonist.

We, therefore, investigated the effects of the histamine 1 ( H1) receptor antagonist, diphenhydramine, on the haemodynamic changes observed after cimetidine in ICU patients.	"histamine	47	56	Chemical/Drug"	"diphenhydramine	86	101	Chemical/Drug"	"cimetidine	146	156	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""histamine"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""diphenhydramine"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""cimetidine"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Each patient was studied on two separate days.	[]
In a random fashion, they received cimetidine 200 mg iv on one day, and on the other, a pretreatment of diphenhydramine 40 mg iv with cimetidine 200 mg iv.	"cimetidine	35	45	Chemical/Drug"	"diphenhydramine	104	119	Chemical/Drug"	"cimetidine	35	45	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cimetidine"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""diphenhydramine"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""cimetidine"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In the non - pretreatment group, mean arterial pressure ( MAP) decreased from 107. 4 + / - 8. 4 mmHg to 86. 7 + / - 11. 4 mmHg ( P less than 0. 01) two minutes after cimetidine.	"cimetidine	166	176	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cimetidine"", ""start_span"": 166, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Also, systemic vascular resistance ( SVR) decreased during the eight - minute observation period ( P less than 0. 01).	[]
In contrast, in the pretreatment group, little haemodynamic change was seen.	[]
We conclude that an H1 antagonist may be useful in preventing hypotension caused by iv cimetidine, since the vasodilating activity of cimetidine is mediated, in part, through the H1 receptor.

RESULTS: Acetaminophen - induced ALF patients undergoing LT had a greater severity of pre - LT illness reflected by higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores and requirement for organ support compared with the other two groups.	"Acetaminophen	9	22	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Acetaminophen"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Twenty ( 56%) acetaminophen - induced ALF patients had a formal psychiatric diagnosis before LT ( non - acetaminophen - induced ALF = 0 / 35, CLD = 2 / 34; P < 0. 01 for all) and nine ( 25%) had a previous suicide attempt.

During follow - up ( median 5 years), there were no significant differences in rejection ( acute and chronic), graft failure or survival between the groups ( acetaminophen - induced ALF 1 year 87%, 5 years 75%; non - acetaminophen - induced ALF 88%, 78%; CLD 93%, 82%: P > 0. 6 log rank).

Multidisciplinary approaches with long - term psychiatric follow - up may contribute to low post - transplant suicide rates seen and low rates of graft loss because of non - compliance.	[]
Antithrombotic drug use, cerebral microbleeds, and intracerebral hemorrhage: a systematic review of published and unpublished studies.	[]
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral microbleeds ( MB) are potential risk factors for intracerebral hemorrhage ( ICH), but it is unclear if they are a contraindication to using antithrombotic drugs.	[]
Insights could be gained by pooling data on MB frequency stratified by antithrombotic use in cohorts with ICH and ischemic stroke ( IS) / transient ischemic attack ( TIA).	[]
METHODS: We performed a systematic review of published and unpublished data from cohorts with stroke or TIA to compare the presence of MB in: ( 1) antithrombotic users vs nonantithrombotic users with ICH; ( 2) antithrombotic users vs nonusers with IS / TIA; and ( 3) ICH vs ischemic events stratified by antithrombotic use.	[]
We also analyzed published and unpublished follow - up data to determine the risk of ICH in antithrombotic users with MB.	[]
RESULTS: In a pooled analysis of 1460 ICH and 3817 IS / TIA, MB were more frequent in ICH vs IS / TIA in all treatment groups, but the excess increased from 2. 8 ( odds ratio; range, 2. 3 - 3. 5) in nonantithrombotic users to 5. 7 ( range, 3. 4 - 9. 7) in antiplatelet users and 8. 0 ( range, 3. 5 - 17. 8) in warfarin users ( P difference = 0. 01).	"warfarin	310	318	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""warfarin"", ""start_span"": 310, ""end_span"": 318, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
There was also an excess of MB in warfarin users vs nonusers with ICH ( OR, 2. 7; 95% CI, 1. 6 - 4. 4; P < 0. 001) but none in warfarin users with IS / TIA ( OR, 1. 3; 95% CI, 0. 9 - 1. 7; P = 0. 33; P difference = 0. 01).

There was a smaller excess of MB in antiplatelet users vs nonusers with ICH ( OR, 1. 7; 95% CI, 1. 3 - 2. 3; P < 0. 001), but findings were similar for antiplatelet users with IS / TIA ( OR, 1. 4; 95% CI, 1. 2 - 1. 7; P < 0. 001; P difference = 0. 25).	[]
In pooled follow - up data for 768 antithrombotic users, presence of MB at baseline was associated with a substantially increased risk of subsequent ICH ( OR, 12. 1; 95% CI, 3. 4 - 42. 5; P < 0. 001).	[]
CONCLUSIONS: The excess of MB in warfarin users with ICH compared to other groups suggests that MB increase the risk of warfarin - associated ICH.

These values were greater than the maximum nonsedating doses.	[]
The ED50 values for morphine when given in combination with CNSB002 ( 5 mg / kg) were less than the maximum nonsedating dose: 0. 56 ( 1. 55) in the carrageenan model and 1. 37 ( 1. 23) in the neuropathy model ( mg / kg; mean, SEM).

Heparin - induced thrombocytopenia: a practical review.	"Heparin	0	7	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Heparin"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Heparin - induced thrombocytopenia ( HIT) remains under - recognized despite its potentially devastating outcomes.	"Heparin	0	7	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Heparin"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
It begins when heparin exposure stimulates the formation of heparin - platelet factor 4 antibodies, which in turn triggers the release of procoagulant platelet particles.	"heparin	15	22	Chemical/Drug"	"heparin	15	22	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""heparin"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""heparin"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Thrombosis and thrombocytopenia that follow comprise the 2 hallmark traits of HIT, with the former largely responsible for significant vascular complications.	[]
The prevalence of HIT varies among several subgroups, with greater incidence in surgical as compared with medical populations.	[]
HIT must be acknowledged for its intense predilection for thrombosis and suspected whenever thrombosis occurs after heparin exposure.	"heparin	116	123	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""heparin"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Early recognition that incorporates the clinical and serologic clues is paramount to timely institution of treatment, as its delay may result in catastrophic outcomes.	[]
The treatment of HIT mandates an immediate cessation of all heparin exposure and the institution of an antithrombotic therapy, most commonly using a direct thrombin inhibitor.

"Current "" diagnostic "" tests, which primarily include functional and antigenic assays, have more of a confirmatory than diagnostic role in the management of HIT."	[]
Special attention must be paid to cardiac patients who are often exposed to heparin multiple times during their course of treatment.	"heparin	76	83	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""heparin"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Patients with ADSD were identified.	[]
The number of treatments received and adverse effects were noted.	[]
For patients with bilateral abductor paralysis, age, sex, paralytic Botox dose, prior Botox dose, and course following paralysis were noted.

RESULTS: From a database of 452 patients receiving Botox, 352 patients had been diagnosed with ADSD.	"Botox	51	56	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Botox"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Of these 352 patients, eight patients suffered bilateral abductor paralysis, and two suffered this complication twice.	[]
All affected patients were females over the age of 50 years.	[]
Most patients had received treatments prior to abductor paralysis and continued receiving after paralysis.	[]
Seven patients recovered after a brief period of activity restrictions, and one underwent a tracheotomy.	[]
The incidence of abductor paralysis after Botox injection for ADSD was 0. 34%.	"Botox	42	47	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Botox"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral abductor paralysis is a rare complication of Botox injections for ADSD, causing difficulty with breathing upon exertion.	"Botox	68	73	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Botox"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

The goal of this study was to assess mitochondrial function and ROS production in an experimental model of cocaine - induced cardiac dysfunction.	"cocaine	107	114	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cocaine"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We hypothesized that cocaine abuse may lead to altered mitochondrial function that in turn may cause left ventricular dysfunction.	[]
Seven days of cocaine administration to rats led to an increased oxygen consumption detected in cardiac fibers, specifically through complex I and complex III.	"cocaine	14	21	Chemical/Drug"	"oxygen	65	71	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cocaine"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""oxygen"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
ROS levels were increased, specifically in interfibrillar mitochondria.	[]
In parallel there was a decrease in ATP synthesis, whereas no difference was observed in subsarcolemmal mitochondria.	"ATP	36	39	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ATP"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
This uncoupling effect on oxidative phosphorylation was not detectable after short - term exposure to cocaine, suggesting that these mitochondrial abnormalities were a late rather than a primary event in the pathological response to cocaine.

Prolactin responses to verapamil in 65 female patients ( age: 29. 9 + / - 8. 1 years) with hyperprolactinemia were tested in a descriptive, matched case - control study.	"verapamil	23	32	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""verapamil"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METHODS: Verapamil 80 mg, p. o. was administered, and then PRL levels were measured at 8th and 16th hours, by immunometric chemiluminescence.	"Verapamil	9	18	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Verapamil"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

OBJECTIVE: A multicenter, controlled trial showed that early blockade of the renin - angiotensin system in patients with type 1 diabetes and normoalbuminuria did not retard the progression of nephropathy, suggesting that other mechanism ( s) are involved in the pathogenesis of early diabetic nephropathy ( diabetic nephropathy).	"angiotensin	85	96	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""angiotensin"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We have previously demonstrated that endothelial - mesenchymal - transition ( EndoMT) contributes to the early development of renal interstitial fibrosis independently of microalbuminuria in mice with streptozotocin ( STZ) - induced diabetes.	"streptozotocin	201	215	Chemical/Drug"	"STZ	218	221	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""streptozotocin"", ""start_span"": 201, ""end_span"": 215, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""STZ"", ""start_span"": 218, ""end_span"": 221, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In the present study, we hypothesized that blocking EndoMT reduces the early development of diabetic nephropathy.	[]
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: EndoMT was induced in a mouse pancreatic microvascular endothelial cell line ( MMEC) in the presence of advanced glycation end products ( AGEs) and in the endothelial lineage - traceble mouse line Tie2 - Cre; Loxp - EGFP by administration of AGEs, with nonglycated mouse albumin serving as a control.	[]
Phosphorylated Smad3 was detected by immunoprecipitation / Western blotting and confocal microscopy.	[]
Blocking studies using receptor for AGE siRNA and a specific inhibitor of Smad3 ( SIS3) were performed in MMECs and in STZ - induced diabetic nephropathy in Tie2 - Cre; Loxp - EGFP mice.	"STZ	119	122	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""STZ"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
RESULTS: Confocal microscopy and real - time PCR demonstrated that AGEs induced EndoMT in MMECs and in Tie2 - Cre; Loxp - EGFP mice.	[]
Immunoprecipitation / Western blotting showed that Smad3 was activated by AGEs but was inhibited by SIS3 in MMECs and in STZ - induced diabetic nephropathy.	"STZ	121	124	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""STZ"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Confocal microscopy and real - time PCR further demonstrated that SIS3 abrogated EndoMT, reduced renal fibrosis, and retarded progression of nephropathy.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: EndoMT is a novel pathway leading to early development of diabetic nephropathy.	[]
Blockade of EndoMT by SIS3 may provide a new strategy to retard the progression of diabetic nephropathy and other diabetes complications.	[]
Cytostatic and anti - angiogenic effects of temsirolimus in refractory mantle cell lymphoma.	"temsirolimus	44	56	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""temsirolimus"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL) is a rare and aggressive type of B - cell non - Hodgkin ' s lymphoma.	[]
Patients become progressively refractory to conventional chemotherapy, and their prognosis is poor.	[]
However, a 38% remission rate has been recently reported in refractory MCL treated with temsirolimus, a mTOR inhibitor. Here we had the opportunity to study a case of refractory MCL who had tumor regression two months after temsirolimus treatment, and a progression - free survival of 10 months.	"temsirolimus	88	100	Chemical/Drug"	"temsirolimus	88	100	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""temsirolimus"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""temsirolimus"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In this case, lymph node biopsies were performed before and six months after temsirolimus therapy.	"temsirolimus	77	89	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""temsirolimus"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Comparison of the two biopsies showed that temsirolimus inhibited tumor cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest, but did not induce any change in the number of apoptotic tumor cells.	"temsirolimus	43	55	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""temsirolimus"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Apart from this cytostatic effect, temsirolimus had an antiangiogenic effect with decrease of tumor microvessel density and of VEGF expression.	"temsirolimus	35	47	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""temsirolimus"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Moreover, numerous patchy, well - limited fibrotic areas, compatible with post - necrotic tissue repair, were found after 6 - month temsirolimus therapy.	"temsirolimus	132	144	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""temsirolimus"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Thus, temsirolimus reduced tumor burden through associated cytostatic and anti - angiogenic effects.

The aim of the current study was to determine the effects of NO on the behavioral and EEG characteristics of lindane - induced epilepsy in male Wistar albino rats.

The administration of L - arginine ( 600, 800 and 1000 mg / kg, i. p.) in dose - dependent manner significantly increased convulsion incidence and severity and shortened latency time to first convulsion elicited by lower lindane dose ( 4 mg / kg, i. p.).

On the contrary, pretreatment with L - NAME ( 500, 700 and 900 mg / kg, i. p.) decreased convulsion incidence and severity and prolonged latency time to convulsion following injection with a convulsive dose of lindane ( 8 mg / kg, i. p.).

To our knowledge, however, axonal neuropathy following administration of these three agents has not been previously described.	[]
In spite of the fact that TSPA is a useful IT agent, its combination with MTX, ara - C and radiotherapy could cause severe neurotoxicity.

The effects of i. v. bolus administration of cromakalim ( 1 - 10 micrograms / kg) and pinacidil ( 3 - 100 micrograms / kg) on large ( circumflex artery) and small coronary arteries and on systemic hemodynamics were investigated in chronically instrumented conscious dogs and compared to those of nitroglycerin ( 0. 03 - 10 micrograms / kg).	"cromakalim	45	55	Chemical/Drug"	"pinacidil	86	95	Chemical/Drug"	"nitroglycerin	296	309	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cromakalim"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""pinacidil"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""nitroglycerin"", ""start_span"": 296, ""end_span"": 309, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Nitroglycerin, up to 0. 3 micrograms / kg, selectively increased circumflex artery diameter ( CxAD) without simultaneously affecting any other cardiac or systemic hemodynamic parameter.	"Nitroglycerin	0	13	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Nitroglycerin"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In contrast, cromakalim and pinacidil at all doses and nitroglycerin at doses higher than 0. 3 micrograms / kg simultaneously and dose - dependently increased CxAD, coronary blood flow and heart rate and decreased coronary vascular resistance and aortic pressure.	"cromakalim	13	23	Chemical/Drug"	"pinacidil	28	37	Chemical/Drug"	"nitroglycerin	55	68	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cromakalim"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""pinacidil"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""nitroglycerin"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Cromakalim was approximately 8 - to 9. 5 - fold more potent than pinacidil in increasing CxAD.

Vasodilation of large and small coronary vessels and hypotension induced by cromakalim and pinacidil were not affected by prior combined beta adrenergic and muscarinic receptors blockade but drug - induced tachycardia was abolished.	"cromakalim	76	86	Chemical/Drug"	"pinacidil	91	100	Chemical/Drug"	"beta adrenergic and muscarinic receptors blockade	137	186	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cromakalim"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""pinacidil"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""beta adrenergic and muscarinic receptors blockade"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 186, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
When circumflex artery blood flow was maintained constant, the increases in CxAD induced by cromakalim ( 10 micrograms / kg), pinacidil ( 30 micrograms / kg) and nitroglycerin ( 10 micrograms / kg) were reduced by 68 + / - 7, 54 + / - 9 and 1 + / - 1%, respectively.

Thus, whereas nitroglycerin preferentially and flow - independently dilates large coronary arteries, cromakalim and pinacidil dilate both large and small coronary arteries and this effect is not dependent upon the simultaneous beta adrenoceptors - mediated rise in myocardial metabolic demand.

Finally, two mechanisms at least, direct vasodilation and flow dependency, are involved in the cromakalim - and pinacidil - induced increase in CxAD.

Cerebellar sensory processing alterations impact motor cortical plasticity in Parkinson ' s disease: clues from dyskinetic patients.	[]
The plasticity of primary motor cortex ( M1) in patients with Parkinson ' s disease ( PD) and levodopa - induced dyskinesias ( LIDs) is severely impaired.	"levodopa	94	102	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""levodopa"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We recently reported in young healthy subjects that inhibitory cerebellar stimulation enhanced the sensorimotor plasticity of M1 that was induced by paired associative stimulation ( PAS).	[]
This study demonstrates that the deficient sensorimotor M1 plasticity in 16 patients with LIDs could be reinstated by a single session of real inhibitory cerebellar stimulation but not sham stimulation.	[]
This was evident only when a sensory component was involved in the induction of plasticity, indicating that cerebellar sensory processing function is involved in the resurgence of M1 plasticity.	[]
The benefit of inhibitory cerebellar stimulation on LIDs is known.	[]
To explore whether this benefit is linked to the restoration of sensorimotor plasticity of M1, we conducted an additional study looking at changes in LIDs and PAS - induced plasticity after 10 sessions of either bilateral, real inhibitory cerebellar stimulation or sham stimulation.	[]
Only real and not sham stimulation had an antidyskinetic effect and it was paralleled by a resurgence in the sensorimotor plasticity of M1.	[]
These results suggest that alterations in cerebellar sensory processing function, occurring secondary to abnormal basal ganglia signals reaching it, may be an important element contributing to the maladaptive sensorimotor plasticity of M1 and the emergence of abnormal involuntary movements.	[]

The mean age of the patients was 35. 2 years and the mean duration of therapy was 59. 7 months.	[]
Virtually all patients experienced one or more adverse reactions.	[]
Menstrual abnormalities ( 79%), weight gain ( 60%), muscle cramps / myalgias ( 40%), and transaminase elevations ( 40%) were the most common adverse reactions.	[]
The drug was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 8 patients.	[]
No patient has died or suffered any apparent long - term sequelae that were directly attributable to the drug.	[]
We conclude that, despite a relatively high incidence of adverse reactions, danazol has proven to be remarkably safe over the long - term in this group of patients.	"danazol	76	83	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""danazol"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Effective topical antimicrobial agents decrease infection and mortality in burn patients.	[]
Chlorhexidine phosphanilate ( CHP), a new broad - spectrum antimicrobial agent, has been evaluated as a topical burn wound dressing in cream form, but preliminary clinical trials reported that it was painful upon application.

Twenty - nine burn patients, each with two similar burns which could be separately treated, were given pairs of treatments at successive 12 - h intervals over a 3 - day period.	[]
One burn site was treated with each of four different CHP concentrations, from 0. 25 per cent to 2 per cent, their vehicle, and 1 per cent silver sulphadiazine ( AgSD) cream, an antimicrobial agent frequently used for topical treatment of burn wounds.

Reports that satisfy defined criteria were classified as acute kidney injury, kidney tubular dysfunction and Fanconi syndrome.	[]
Of the 407 Yellow Card records analysed, 106 satisfied criteria for TDF - related kidney disease, of which 53 ( 50%) had features of kidney tubular dysfunction, 35 ( 33%) were found to have features of glomerular dysfunction and 18 ( 17%) had Fanconi syndrome.

Incidence of postoperative delirium is high even in a population without known risk factors.	[]
PURPOSE: Postoperative delirium is a recognized complication in populations at risk.	[]
The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of early postoperative delirium in a population without known risk factors admitted to the ICU for postoperative monitoring after elective major surgery.	[]
The secondary outcome investigated is to identify eventual independent risk factors among demographic data and anesthetic drugs used.	[]
METHODS: An observational, prospective study was conducted on a consecutive cohort of patients admitted to our ICU within and for at least 24 h after major surgical procedures.	[]
Exclusion criteria were any preexisting predisposing factor for delirium or other potentially confounding neurological dysfunctions.	[]
Patients were assessed daily using the confusion assessment method for the ICU scale for 3 days after the surgical procedure.	[]
Early postoperative delirium incidence risk factors were then assessed through three different multiple regression models.	[]
RESULTS: According to the confusion assessment method for the ICU scale, 28% of patients were diagnosed with early postoperative delirium.	[]
The use of thiopentone was significantly associated with an eight - fold - higher risk for delirium compared to propofol ( 57. 1% vs. 7. 1%, RR = 8. 0, X2 = 4. 256; df = 1; 0. 05 < p < 0. 02).

Methamphetamine ( METH) triggers a disruption of the monoaminergic system and METH abuse leads to negative emotional states including depressive symptoms during drug withdrawal.

In parallel, another neurochemical feature of depression - - astroglial dysfunction - - was unaffected in the cortex and the striatal levels of the astrocytic protein marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein, were only transiently increased at 3 days.	[]

Resuscitation continued for 30 min or until there was a return of spontaneous circulation ( ROSC) accompanied by a mean arterial pressure at or superior to the baseline pressure and normal sinus rhythm for a period of 30 min.	[]
RESULTS: ROSC was achieved in only one of the control piglets compared with most of the treated piglets.	[]
Mortality was not significantly different between the three treatment groups, but was significantly lower in all the treatment groups compared with control.	[]
The number of ECG abnormalities was zero in the Intralipid only group, but 14 and 17, respectively, in the epinephrine and epinephrine plus lipid groups ( P < 0. 05).

BACKGROUND: Thrombocytopenia in patients with end - stage liver disease is a common disorder caused mainly by portal hypertension, low levels of thrombopoetin, and endotoxemia.	[]
The impact of immune - mediated heparin - induced thrombocytopenia type II ( HIT type II) as a cause of thrombocytopenia after liver transplantation is not yet understood, with few literature citations reporting contradictory results.

The aim of our study was to demonstrate the perioperative course of thrombocytopenia after liver transplantation and determine the occurrence of clinical HIT type II.	[]
METHOD: We retrospectively evaluated the medical records of 205 consecutive adult patients who underwent full - size liver transplantation between January 2006 and December 2010 due to end - stage or malignant liver disease.	[]
Preoperative platelet count, postoperative course of platelets, and clinical signs of HIT type II were analyzed.	[]
RESULTS: A total of 155 ( 75. 6%) of 205 patients had thrombocytopenia before transplantation, significantly influenced by Model of End - Stage Liver Disease score and liver cirrhosis.	[]
The platelet count exceeded 100, 000 / uL in most of the patients ( n = 193) at a medium of 7 d.	[]
Regarding HIT II, there were four ( 1. 95%) patients with a background of HIT type II.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of HIT in patients with end - stage hepatic failure is, with about 1. 95%, rare.	[]
For further reduction of HIT type II, the use of intravenous heparin should be avoided and the prophylactic anticoagulation should be performed with low - molecular - weight heparin after normalization of platelet count.

It has been shown that exposure to diazinon may interfere with lipid metabolism.	"diazinon	35	43	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""diazinon"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Moreover, the hypolipidemic effect of crocin has been established.	"crocin	38	44	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""crocin"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Earlier studies revealed the major role of Extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( ERK) pathways in low - density lipoprotein receptor ( LDLr) expression.	[]
The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in the regulation of lipid metabolism, ERK and LDLr expression in the liver of rats exposed to subacute diazinon.	"diazinon	150	158	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""diazinon"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Furthermore ameliorating effect of crocin on diazinon induced disturbed cholesterol homeostasis was studied.

GEM - P chemotherapy is active in the treatment of relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma.	"GEM	0	3	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""GEM"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Hodgkin lymphoma ( HL) is a relatively chemosensitive malignancy.	[]
However, for those who relapse, high - dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant is the treatment of choice which relies on adequate disease control with salvage chemotherapy.	[]
Regimens commonly used often require inpatient administration and can be difficult to deliver due to toxicity.	[]
Gemcitabine and cisplatin have activity in HL, non - overlapping toxicity with first - line chemotherapeutics, and may be delivered in an outpatient setting.

Overall response rate ( ORR) to GEM - P in the entire cohort was 80% ( complete response ( CR) 37%, partial response 44%) with 14 / 15 CR confirmed as a metabolic CR on PET and ORR of 85% in the 20 second - line patients.	"GEM	32	35	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""GEM"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The most common grade 3 / 4 toxicities were haematological: neutropenia 54% and thrombocytopenia 51%.	[]
Median follow - up from the start of GEM - P was 4. 5 years.	"GEM	37	40	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""GEM"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Following GEM - P, 5 - year progression - free survival was 46% ( 95% confidence interval ( CI), 30 - 62%) and 5 - year overall survival was 59% ( 95% CI, 43 - 74%).	"GEM	10	13	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""GEM"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

While some recent studies suggest acute changes in neuroendocrine function, less is known about long - term changes in HPA functionality in recreational users.	[]
OBJECTIVES: The current study is the first to explore the effects of ecstasy - polydrug use on psychological distress and basal functioning of the HPA axis through assessing the secretion of cortisol across the diurnal period.

METHOD: Seventy - six participants ( 21 nonusers, 29 light ecstasy - polydrug users, 26 heavy ecstasy - polydrug users) completed a substance use inventory and measures of psychological distress at baseline, then two consecutive days of cortisol sampling ( on awakening, 30 min post awakening, between 1400 and 1600 hours and pre bedtime).	"ecstasy	59	66	Chemical/Drug"	"ecstasy	59	66	Chemical/Drug"	"cortisol	237	245	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ecstasy"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""ecstasy"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""cortisol"", ""start_span"": 237, ""end_span"": 245, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
On day 2, participants also attended the laboratory to complete a 20 - min multitasking stressor.	[]
RESULTS: Both user groups exhibited significantly greater levels of anxiety and depression than nonusers.	[]
On day 1, all participants exhibited a typical cortisol profile, though light users had significantly elevated levels pre - bed.	"cortisol	47	55	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cortisol"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
On day 2, heavy users demonstrated elevated levels upon awakening and all ecstasy - polydrug users demonstrated elevated pre - bed levels compared to non - users.	"ecstasy	74	81	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ecstasy"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Significant between group differences were also observed in afternoon cortisol levels and in overall cortisol secretion across the day.

Animals used at M0 ( n = 8) were also used at moment - 24 h of acute study.	[]
Cardiac total antioxidant performance ( TAP), DNA damage, and morphology analyses were carried out at each time point.	[]
Single dose of DOX was associated with increased cardiac disarrangement, necrosis, and DNA damage ( strand breaks ( SBs) and oxidized pyrimidines) and decreased TAP.	"DOX	15	18	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""DOX"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The chronological study showed an effect of a cumulative dose on body weight ( R = - 0. 99, p = 0. 011), necrosis ( R = 1. 00, p = 0. 004), TAP ( R = 0. 95, p = 0. 049), and DNA SBs ( R = - 0. 95, p = 0. 049).	[]
DNA SBs damage was negatively associated with TAP ( R = - 0. 98, p = 0. 018), and necrosis ( R = - 0. 97, p = 0. 027).	[]
Our results suggest that oxidative damage is associated with acute cardiotoxicity induced by a single dose of DOX only.	"DOX	110	113	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""DOX"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

The present experiments were performed to study the effect of the flavonoid apigenin ( 20 mg / kg intraperitoneally ( i. p.), 1 h before acquisition), on 24 h retention performance and forgetting of a step - through passive avoidance task, in young male Wistar rats.

We recorded time to first dysrhythmia occurrence, respective times to 25% and 50% reduction of the heart rate ( HR) and mean arterial pressure, and time to asystole and total amount of bupivacaine consumption.	"bupivacaine	185	196	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""bupivacaine"", ""start_span"": 185, ""end_span"": 196, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Blood and tissue samples were collected following asystole.	[]
RESULTS: The time to first dysrhythmia occurrence, time to 25% and 50% reductions in HR, and time to asystole were longer in Group P than the other groups.	[]
The cumulative bupivacaine dose given at those time points was higher in Group P. Plasma bupivacaine levels were significantly lower in Group P than in Group C. Bupivacaine levels in the brain and heart were significantly lower in Group P and Group L than in Group C.

Blood collection and echocardiography were performed at baseline, 1 day after the third cycle, and 1 day after completion of chemotherapy.	[]
Patients were studied using echocardiography during follow - up.	[]
Global longitudinal ( GLS), circumferential ( GCS), and radial strain ( GRS) were calculated using speckle tracking echocardiography.	[]
Left ventricular ejection fraction was analysed by real - time 3D echocardiography.	[]
Cardiotoxicity was defined as a reduction of the LVEF of > 5% to < 55% with symptoms of heart failure or an asymptomatic reduction of the LVEF of > 10% to < 55%.	[]
RESULTS: Fourteen patients ( 18. 67%) developed cardiotoxicity after treatment.	[]
GLS ( - 18. 48 + 1. 72% vs. - 15. 96 + 1. 6%), GCS ( - 20. 93 + 2. 86% vs. - 19. 20 + 3. 21%), and GRS ( 39. 23 + 6. 44% vs. 34. 98 + 6. 2%) were markedly reduced and cTnT was elevated from 0. 0010 + 0. 0020 to 0. 0073 + 0. 0038 ng / mL ( P all < 0. 01) at the completion of chemotherapy compared with baseline values.	[]
A > 15. 9% decrease in GLS [ sensitivity, 86%; specificity, 75%; area under the curve ( AUC) = 0. 815; P = 0. 001] and a > 0. 004 ng / mL elevation in cTnT ( sensitivity, 79%; specificity, 64%; AUC = 0. 757; P = 0. 005) from baseline to the third cycle of chemotherapy predicted later cardiotoxicity.	[]
The decrease in GLS remained the only independent predictor of cardiotoxicity ( P = 0. 000).	[]
CONCLUSIONS: GLS combined with cTnT may provide a reliable and non - invasive method to predict cardiac dysfunction in patients receiving anthracycline - based chemotherapy.

The association between tranexamic acid and convulsive seizures after cardiac surgery: a multivariate analysis in 11 529 patients.	"tranexamic acid	24	39	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""tranexamic acid"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Because of a lack of contemporary data regarding seizures after cardiac surgery, we undertook a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from 11 529 patients in whom cardiopulmonary bypass was used from January 2004 to December 2010.	[]
A convulsive seizure was defined as a transient episode of disturbed brain function characterised by abnormal involuntary motor movements.	[]
Multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of postoperative seizures.	[]
A total of 100 ( 0. 9%) patients developed postoperative convulsive seizures.	[]
Generalised and focal seizures were identified in 68 and 32 patients, respectively.	[]
The median ( IQR [ range]) time after surgery when the seizure occurred was 7 ( 6 - 12 [ 1 - 216]) h and 8 ( 6 - 11 [ 4 - 18]) h, respectively.	[]
Epileptiform findings on electroencephalography were seen in 19 patients.	[]
Independent predictors of postoperative seizures included age, female sex, redo cardiac surgery, calcification of ascending aorta, congestive heart failure, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, duration of aortic cross - clamp and tranexamic acid.	"tranexamic acid	231	246	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""tranexamic acid"", ""start_span"": 231, ""end_span"": 246, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
When tested in a multivariate regression analysis, tranexamic acid was a strong independent predictor of seizures ( OR 14. 3, 95% CI 5. 5 - 36. 7; p < 0. 001).	"tranexamic acid	51	66	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""tranexamic acid"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Patients with convulsive seizures had 2. 5 times higher in - hospital mortality rates and twice the length of hospital stay compared with patients without convulsive seizures.	[]
Mean ( IQR [ range]) length of stay in the intensive care unit was 115 ( 49 - 228 [ 32 - 481]) h in patients with convulsive seizures compared with 26 ( 22 - 69 [ 14 - 1080]) h in patients without seizures ( p < 0. 001).	[]
Convulsive seizures are a serious postoperative complication after cardiac surgery.	[]
As tranexamic acid is the only modifiable factor, its administration, particularly in doses exceeding 80 mg. kg ( - 1), should be weighed against the risk of postoperative seizures.

Memory recall of word pairs was evaluated before and after a period of sleep, with and without interference prior to testing.	[]
In addition, we assessed neurocognitive performances across tasks of learning, memory and executive functioning.	[]
Ecstasy users demonstrated impaired overnight memory consolidation, a finding that was more pronounced following associative interference.	"Ecstasy	0	7	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Ecstasy"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Pethidine is an opioid that gains its popularity for the effective pain control through acting on the opioid - receptors.	"Pethidine	0	9	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Pethidine"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
However, rapid pain relief sometimes brings about unfavourable side effects that largely limit its clinical utility.	[]
Common side effects include nausea, vomiting and hypotension.	[]
In patients with impaired renal and liver function, and those who need long - term pain control, pethidine may cause excitatory central nervous system ( CNS) effects through its neurotoxic metabolite, norpethidine, resulting in irritability and seizure attack.

The Holter electrocardiogram, which was worn by chance, revealed torsade de pointes with gradually prolonged QT intervals.	[]
This drug is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and most of it is excreted from the kidney.	[]
Although the patient ' s renal function was not highly impaired and the dose of pilsicainide was low, the plasma concentration of pilsicainide may have been high, which can produce torsades de pointes in the octogenarian.

In summary, subcellular cardiomyocyte degeneration was the earliest marker, followed by progressive functional decline and histopathological manifestations.	[]
Myocardial contrast enhancement and elevations in cTnI occurred later.	[]
"However, all indices predated "" clinical "" LV dysfunction and thus warrant further evaluation as predictive biomarkers."	[]
Intradermal glutamate and capsaicin injections: intra - and interindividual variability of provoked hyperalgesia and allodynia.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the reproducibility of these models.	[]
Twenty healthy male volunteers ( mean age 24 years; range 18 - 38 years) received intradermal injections of glutamate and capsaicin in the volar forearm.

Magnitudes of secondary pinprick hyperalgesia and brush - evoked allodynia were investigated using von Frey filaments ( gauges 10, 15, 60 and 100 g) and brush strokes.	[]
Areas of secondary hyperalgesia and allodynia were quantified immediately after injection and after 15, 30 and 60 min.	[]
Two identical experiments separated by at least 7 days were performed.	[]
Reproducibility across and within volunteers ( inter - and intra - individual variation, respectively) was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC) and coefficient of variation ( CV).	[]
Secondary pinprick hyperalgesia was observed as a marked increase in the visual analogue scale ( VAS) response to von Frey gauges 60 and 100 g ( P < 0. 001) after glutamate injection.	"glutamate	163	172	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""glutamate"", ""start_span"": 163, ""end_span"": 172, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
For capsaicin, secondary pinprick hyperalgesia was detected with all von Frey gauges ( P < 0. 001).	"capsaicin	4	13	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""capsaicin"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Glutamate evoked reproducible VAS response to all von Frey gauges ( ICC > 0. 60) and brush strokes ( ICC > 0. 83).	"Glutamate	0	9	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Glutamate"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Capsaicin injection was reproducible for secondary hyperalgesia ( ICC > 0. 70) and allodynia ( ICC > 0. 71).	"Capsaicin	0	9	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Capsaicin"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Intra - individual variability was generally lower for the VAS response to von Frey and brush compared with areas of secondary hyperalgesia and allodynia.	[]
In conclusion, glutamate and capsaicin yield reproducible hyperalgesic and allodynic responses, and the present model is well suited for basic research, as well as for assessing the modulation of central phenomena.

Ocular - specific ER stress reduction rescues glaucoma in murine glucocorticoid - induced glaucoma.	[]
Administration of glucocorticoids induces ocular hypertension in some patients.	[]
If untreated, these patients can develop a secondary glaucoma that resembles primary open - angle glaucoma ( POAG).	[]
The underlying pathology of glucocorticoid - induced glaucoma is not fully understood, due in part to lack of an appropriate animal model.	[]
Here, we developed a murine model of glucocorticoid - induced glaucoma that exhibits glaucoma features that are observed in patients.	[]
Treatment of WT mice with topical ocular 0. 1% dexamethasone led to elevation of intraocular pressure ( IOP), functional and structural loss of retinal ganglion cells, and axonal degeneration, resembling glucocorticoid - induced glaucoma in human patients.	"dexamethasone	47	60	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dexamethasone"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Furthermore, dexamethasone - induced ocular hypertension was associated with chronic ER stress of the trabecular meshwork ( TM).	"dexamethasone	13	26	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dexamethasone"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Similar to patients, withdrawal of dexamethasone treatment reduced elevated IOP and ER stress in this animal model.	"dexamethasone	35	48	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dexamethasone"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Dexamethasone induced the transcriptional factor CHOP, a marker for chronic ER stress, in the anterior segment tissues, and Chop deletion reduced ER stress in these tissues and prevented dexamethasone - induced ocular hypertension.

Furthermore, reduction of ER stress in the TM with sodium 4 - phenylbutyrate prevented dexamethasone - induced ocular hypertension in WT mice.	"sodium 4 - phenylbutyrate	51	76	Chemical/Drug"	"dexamethasone	87	100	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sodium 4 - phenylbutyrate"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""dexamethasone"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Our data indicate that ER stress contributes to glucocorticoid - induced ocular hypertension and suggest that reducing ER stress has potential as a therapeutic strategy for treating glucocorticoid - induced glaucoma.	[]

Opioid - induced hyperalgesia ( OIH) is characterized by nociceptive sensitization caused by the cessation of chronic opioid use.	[]
OIH can limit the clinical use of opioid analgesics and complicate withdrawal from opioid addiction.	[]
In this study, we investigated the effects of Re, Rg1, and Rb1 ginsenosides, the bioactive components of ginseng, on OIH.	[]
OIH was achieved in mice after subcutaneous administration of morphine for 7 consecutive days three times per day.	"morphine	62	70	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""morphine"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
During withdrawal ( days 8 and 9), these mice were administered Re, Rg1, or Rb1 intragastrically two times per day.

On the test day ( day 10), mice were subjected to the thermal sensitivity test and the acetic acid - induced writhing test.	"acetic acid	87	98	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""acetic acid"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Re ( 300 mg / kg) inhibited OIH in both the thermal sensitivity test and the acetic acid - induced writhing test.

DESIGN: Multicenter, retrospective, propensity - matched cohort study.	[]
SETTING: Neurocritical care units at two academic medical centers with dedicated neurocritical care teams and board - certified neurointensivists.	[]
PATIENTS: Neurocritical care patients admitted between July 2009 and September 2012 were evaluated and then matched 1: 1 based on propensity scoring of baseline characteristics.	[]
INTERVENTIONS: Continuous sedation with dexmedetomidine or propofol.

The primary outcome of this study was a composite of severe hypotension ( mean arterial pressure < 60 mm Hg) and bradycardia ( heart rate < 50 beats / min) during sedative infusion.	[]
No difference in the primary composite outcome in both the unmatched ( 30% vs 30%, p = 0. 94) or matched cohorts ( 28% vs 34%, p = 0. 35) could be found.	[]
When analyzed separately, no differences could be found in the prevalence of severe hypotension or bradycardia in either the unmatched or matched cohorts.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: Severe hypotension and bradycardia occur at similar prevalence in neurocritical care patients who receive dexmedetomidine or propofol.

Availability of human induced pluripotent stem cell - derived cardiomyocytes in assessment of drug potential for QT prolongation.	[]
Field potential duration ( FPD) in human - induced pluripotent stem cell - derived cardiomyocytes ( hiPS - CMs), which can express QT interval in an electrocardiogram, is reported to be a useful tool to predict K ( +) channel and Ca ( 2 +) channel blocker effects on QT interval.

However, there is no report showing that this technique can be used to predict multichannel blocker potential for QT prolongation.	[]
The aim of this study is to show that FPD from MEA ( Multielectrode array) of hiPS - CMs can detect QT prolongation induced by multichannel blockers.	[]
hiPS - CMs were seeded onto MEA and FPD was measured for 2min every 10min for 30min after drug exposure for the vehicle and each drug concentration.	[]

Dermal developmental toxicity of N - phenylimide herbicides in rats.	[]
BACKGROUND: S - 53482 and S - 23121 are N - phenylimide herbicides and produced embryolethality, teratogenicity ( mainly ventricular septal defects and wavy ribs), and growth retardation in rats in conventional oral developmental toxicity studies.	"S - 53482	12	21	Chemical/Drug"	"S - 23121	26	35	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""S - 53482"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""S - 23121"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Our objective in this study was to investigate whether the compounds induce developmental toxicity via the dermal route, which is more relevant to occupational exposure, hence better addressing human health risks.	[]
METHODS: S - 53482 was administered dermally to rats at 30, 100, and 300 mg / kg during organogenesis, and S - 23121 was administered at 200, 400, and 800 mg / kg ( the maximum applicable dose level).

Fetuses were obtained by a Cesarean section and examined for external, visceral, and skeletal alterations.	[]
RESULTS: Dermal exposure of rats to S - 53482 at 300 mg / kg produced patterns of developmental toxicity similar to those resulting from oral exposure.	"S - 53482	36	45	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""S - 53482"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Toxicity included embryolethality, teratogenicity, and growth retardation.	[]
Dermal administration of S - 23121 at 800 mg / kg resulted in an increased incidence of embryonic death and ventricular septal defect, but retarded fetal growth was not observed as it was following oral exposure to S - 23121.	"S - 23121	25	34	Chemical/Drug"	"S - 23121	25	34	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""S - 23121"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""S - 23121"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results, S - 53482 and S - 23121 were teratogenic when administered dermally to pregnant rats as were the compounds administered orally.	"S - 53482	35	44	Chemical/Drug"	"S - 23121	49	58	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""S - 53482"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""S - 23121"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

BACKGROUND: Cisplatin is a widely used antineoplastic.	"Cisplatin	12	21	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Cisplatin"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
One of the major complications of cisplatin use is dose - limiting nephrotoxicity.	"cisplatin	34	43	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cisplatin"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
There are many strategies to prevent this toxicity, including the use of mannitol as a nephroprotectant in combination with hydration.	"mannitol	73	81	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""mannitol"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the rates of cisplatin - induced nephrotoxicity in cancer patients receiving single - agent cisplatin with and without mannitol.

METHODS: This single - center retrospective analysis was a quasi experiment created by the national mannitol shortage.	"mannitol	100	108	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""mannitol"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Data were collected on adult cancer patients receiving single - agent cisplatin as an outpatient from January 2011 to September 2012.	"cisplatin	70	79	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cisplatin"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The primary outcome was acute kidney injury ( AKI).	[]
RESULTS: We evaluated 143 patients who received single - agent cisplatin; 97. 2% of patients had head and neck cancer as their primary malignancy.	"cisplatin	63	72	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cisplatin"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Patients who did not receive mannitol were more likely to develop nephrotoxicity: odds ratio [ OR] = 2. 646 ( 95% CI = 1. 008, 6. 944; P = 0. 048).	"mannitol	29	37	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""mannitol"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Patients who received the 100 mg / m ( 2) dosing and patients who had a history of hypertension also had a higher likelihood of developing nephrotoxicity: OR = 11. 494 ( 95% CI = 4. 149, 32. 258; P < 0. 0001) and OR = 3. 219 ( 95% CI = 1. 228, 8. 439; P = 0. 017), respectively.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: When limited quantities of mannitol are available, it should preferentially be given to patients at particularly high risk of nephrotoxicity.	"mannitol	40	48	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""mannitol"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Our analysis suggests that those patients receiving the dosing schedule of 100 mg / m ( 2) cisplatin every 3 weeks and those with hypertension are at the greatest risk of nephrotoxicity and would benefit from the addition of mannitol.

Cognitive impairment, the most common and severe comorbidity of epilepsy, greatly diminishes the quality of life.	[]
However, current therapeutic interventions for epilepsy can also cause untoward cognitive effects.	[]
Thus, there is an urgent need for new kinds of agents targeting both seizures and cognition deficits.	[]
Oxidative stress is considered to play an important role in epileptogenesis and cognitive deficits, and antioxidants have a putative antiepileptic potential.	[]
Metformin, the most commonly prescribed antidiabetic oral drug, has antioxidant properties.	"Metformin	0	9	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Metformin"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
This study was designed to evaluate the ameliorative effects of metformin on seizures, cognitive impairment and brain oxidative stress markers observed in pentylenetetrazole - induced kindling animals.

p53 inhibition blocked transient DOX - induced STAT3 activation in MHC - CB7 mice, which was associated with enhanced induction of the DNA repair proteins Ku70 and Ku80.	"DOX	33	36	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""DOX"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Mice with cardiomyocyte - restricted deletion of STAT3 exhibited worse cardiac function, higher levels of cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and a greater induction of Ku70 and Ku80 in response to DOX treatment during the acute stage when compared with control animals.	"DOX	187	190	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""DOX"", ""start_span"": 187, ""end_span"": 190, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
CONCLUSION: These data support a model wherein a p53 - dependent cardioprotective pathway, mediated via STAT3 activation, mitigates DOX - induced myocardial stress during drug delivery.

Standard operating procedures for antibiotic therapy and the occurrence of acute kidney injury: a prospective, clinical, non - interventional, observational study.	[]
INTRODUCTION: Acute kidney injury ( AKI) occurs in 7% of hospitalized and 66% of Intensive Care Unit ( ICU) patients.	[]
It increases mortality, hospital length of stay, and costs.	[]
The aim of this study was to investigate, whether there is an association between adherence to guidelines ( standard operating procedures ( SOP)) for potentially nephrotoxic antibiotics and the occurrence of AKI.	[]
METHODS: This study was carried out as a prospective, clinical, non - interventional, observational study.	[]
Data collection was performed over a total of 170 days in three ICUs at Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin.	[]
A total of 675 patients were included; 163 of these had therapy with vancomycin, gentamicin, or tobramycin; were > 18 years; and treated in the ICU for > 24 hours.	"vancomycin	69	79	Chemical/Drug"	"gentamicin	81	91	Chemical/Drug"	"tobramycin	96	106	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""vancomycin"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""gentamicin"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""tobramycin"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Patients with an adherence to SOP > 70% were classified into the high adherence group ( HAG) and patients with an adherence of < 70% into the low adherence group ( LAG).	[]
AKI was defined according to RIFLE criteria.	[]
Adherence to SOPs was evaluated by retrospective expert audit.	[]
Development of AKI was compared between groups with exact Chi2 - test and multivariate logistic regression analysis ( two - sided P < 0. 05).	[]
RESULTS: LAG consisted of 75 patients ( 46%) versus 88 HAG patients ( 54%).	[]
AKI occurred significantly more often in LAG with 36% versus 21% in HAG ( P = 0. 035).	[]
Basic characteristics were comparable, except an increased rate of soft tissue infections in LAG.	[]
Multivariate analysis revealed an odds ratio of 2. 5 - fold for LAG to develop AKI compared with HAG ( 95% confidence interval 1. 195 to 5. 124, P = 0. 039).	[]
CONCLUSION: Low adherence to SOPs for potentially nephrotoxic antibiotics was associated with a higher occurrence of AKI.	[]

Cisplatin treatment has been adopted in some chemotherapies; however, this drug can induce acute kidney injury due its ability to negatively affect renal function, augment serum levels of creatinine and urea, increase the acute tubular necrosis score and up - regulate cytokines ( e. g., IL - 1b and TNF - a).	"Cisplatin	0	9	Chemical/Drug"	"creatinine	188	198	Chemical/Drug"	"urea	203	207	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Cisplatin"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""creatinine"", ""start_span"": 188, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""urea"", ""start_span"": 203, ""end_span"": 207, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The kinin B2 receptor has been associated with the inflammation process, as well as the regulation of cytokine expression, and its deletion resulted in an improvement in the diabetic nephropathy status.	[]
To examine the role of the kinin B2 receptor in cisplatin - induced acute kidney injury, kinin B2 receptor knockout mice were challenged with cisplatin.	"cisplatin	48	57	Chemical/Drug"	"cisplatin	48	57	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cisplatin"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""cisplatin"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Additionally, WT mice were treated with a B2 receptor antagonist after cisplatin administration.	"cisplatin	71	80	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cisplatin"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
B2 receptor - deficient mice were less sensitive to this drug than the WT mice, as shown by reduced weight loss, better preservation of kidney function, down regulation of inflammatory cytokines and less acute tubular necrosis.	[]
Moreover, treatment with the kinin B2 receptor antagonist effectively reduced the levels of serum creatinine and blood urea after cisplatin administration.	"creatinine	98	108	Chemical/Drug"	"urea	119	123	Chemical/Drug"	"cisplatin	130	139	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""creatinine"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""urea"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""cisplatin"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Thus, our data suggest that the kinin B2 receptor is involved in cisplatin - induced acute kidney injury by mediating the necrotic process and the expression of inflammatory cytokines, thus resulting in declined renal function.

MATERIAL AND METHOD: A 40 - year - old woman presented with decreased sensation and paresthesia over her right lateral forearm; the paresthesia had occurred after a steroid injection in the right lateral epicondyle 3 months before.	"steroid	165	172	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""steroid"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 172, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Her sensation of light touch and pain was diminished over the lateral side of the right forearm and wrist area.	[]
RESULTS: The sensory action potential amplitude of the right lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve ( LACN) ( 6. 2 uV) was lower than that of the left ( 13. 1 uV).	[]
The difference of amplitude between both sides was significant because there was more than a 50% reduction.	[]
She was diagnosed with right LACNP ( mainly axonal involvement) on the basis of the clinical manifestation and the electrodiagnostic findings.	[]
Her symptoms improved through physical therapy but persisted to some degree.	[]
CONCLUSION: This report describes the case of a woman with LACNP that developed after a steroid injection for the treatment of lateral epicondylitis.	"steroid	88	95	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""steroid"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Three major results are reported.	[]
First, pretreatment with MK - 801 produced an effective and dose - dependent anticonvulsant action with the lithium - pilocarpine model but not with rats treated with pilocarpine alone, suggesting that different biochemical mechanisms control seizures in these two models.	"MK - 801	25	33	Chemical/Drug"	"lithium	108	115	Chemical/Drug"	"pilocarpine	118	129	Chemical/Drug"	"pilocarpine	118	129	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""MK - 801"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""lithium"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""pilocarpine"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""pilocarpine"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Second, the anticonvulsant effect of MK - 801 in the lithium - pilocarpine model only occurred after initial periods of seizure activity.	"MK - 801	37	45	Chemical/Drug"	"lithium	53	60	Chemical/Drug"	"pilocarpine	63	74	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""MK - 801"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""lithium"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""pilocarpine"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
This observation is suggested to be an in vivo demonstration of the conclusion derived from in vitro experiments that MK - 801 binding requires agonist - induced opening of the channel sites of the NMDA receptor.	"MK - 801	118	126	Chemical/Drug"	"NMDA	198	202	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""MK - 801"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""NMDA"", ""start_span"": 198, ""end_span"": 202, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Third, although it is relatively easy to block seizures induced by lithium and pilocarpine by administration of anticonvulsants prior to pilocarpine, it is more difficult to terminate ongoing status epilepticus and block the lethality of the seizures.	"lithium	67	74	Chemical/Drug"	"pilocarpine	79	90	Chemical/Drug"	"pilocarpine	79	90	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""lithium"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""pilocarpine"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""pilocarpine"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Administration of MK - 801 30 or 60 min after pilocarpine, i. e., during status epilepticus, gradually reduced electrical and behavioral seizure activity and greatly enhanced the survival rate.	"MK - 801	18	26	Chemical/Drug"	"pilocarpine	46	57	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""MK - 801"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""pilocarpine"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
These results suggest that activation of NMDA receptors plays an important role in status epilepticus and brain damage in the lithium - pilocarpine model.

This was further supported by results showing that nonconvulsive doses of NMDA and pilocarpine were synergistic, resulting in status epilepticus and subsequent mortality.

Pneumonia was the most common infection and 61% of 59 episodes were cured.	[]
Gram - negative bacilli were the most common causative organisms and 69% of these infections were cured.	[]

OBJECTIVE: Diazinon, a common organophosphate insecticide with genotoxic properties, was previously associated with lung cancer in the Agricultural Health Study ( AHS) cohort, but few other epidemiological studies have examined diazinon - associated cancer risk.

We used updated diazinon exposure and cancer incidence information to evaluate solid tumour risk in the AHS.	"diazinon	16	24	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""diazinon"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METHODS: Male pesticide applicators in Iowa and North Carolina reported lifetime diazinon use at enrolment ( 1993 - 1997) and follow - up ( 1998 - 2005); cancer incidence was assessed through 2010 ( North Carolina) / 2011 ( Iowa).	"diazinon	81	89	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""diazinon"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Among applicators with usage information sufficient to evaluate exposure - response patterns, we used Poisson regression to estimate adjusted rate ratios ( RRs) and 95% CI for cancer sites with > 10 exposed cases for both lifetime ( LT) exposure days and intensity - weighted ( IW) lifetime exposure days ( accounting for factors impacting exposure).	[]
RESULTS: We observed elevated lung cancer risks ( N = 283) among applicators with the greatest number of LT ( RR = 1. 60; 95% CI 1. 11 to 2. 31; Ptrend = 0. 02) and IW days of diazinon use ( RR = 1. 41; 95% CI 0. 98 to 2. 04; Ptrend = 0. 08).	"diazinon	176	184	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""diazinon"", ""start_span"": 176, ""end_span"": 184, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Kidney cancer ( N = 94) risks were non - significantly elevated ( RRLT days = 1. 77; 95% CI 0. 90 to 3. 51; Ptrend = 0. 09; RRIW days 1. 37; 95% CI 0. 64 to 2. 92; Ptrend = 0. 50), as were risks for aggressive prostate cancer ( N = 656).	[]
CONCLUSIONS: Our updated evaluation of diazinon provides additional evidence of an association with lung cancer risk.	"diazinon	39	47	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""diazinon"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

METHODS: We used logistic regression to determine the associations of these pollutants with self - reported, doctor - diagnosed Parkinson ' s disease.	[]
Daily predicted pollutant concentrations were used to derive surrogates of long - term exposure and link them to study participants ' geocoded addresses.	[]
RESULTS: We observed positive associations of Parkinson ' s disease with ozone ( odds ratio = 1. 39; 95% CI: 0. 98 to 1. 98) and fine particulate matter ( odds ratio = 1. 34; 95% CI: 0. 93 to 1. 93) in North Carolina but not in Iowa.

CONCLUSIONS: The plausibility of an effect of ambient concentrations of these pollutants on Parkinson ' s disease risk is supported by experimental data demonstrating damage to dopaminergic neurons at relevant concentrations.	[]
Additional studies are needed to address uncertainties related to confounding and to examine temporal aspects of the associations we observed.	[]
Low functional programming of renal AT2R mediates the developmental origin of glomerulosclerosis in adult offspring induced by prenatal caffeine exposure.	"caffeine	136	144	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""caffeine"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
UNASSIGNED: Our previous study has indicated that prenatal caffeine exposure ( PCE) could induce intrauterine growth retardation ( IUGR) of offspring.	"caffeine	59	67	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""caffeine"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Recent research suggested that IUGR is a risk factor for glomerulosclerosis.	[]
However, whether PCE could induce glomerulosclerosis and its underlying mechanisms remain unknown.	[]
This study aimed to demonstrate the induction to glomerulosclerosis in adult offspring by PCE and its intrauterine programming mechanisms.	[]
A rat model of IUGR was established by PCE, male fetuses and adult offspring at the age of postnatal week 24 were euthanized.	[]
The results revealed that the adult offspring kidneys in the PCE group exhibited glomerulosclerosis as well as interstitial fibrosis, accompanied by elevated levels of serum creatinine and urine protein.	"creatinine	174	184	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""creatinine"", ""start_span"": 174, ""end_span"": 184, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Renal angiotensin II receptor type 2 ( AT2R) gene expression in adult offspring was reduced by PCE, whereas the renal angiotensin II receptor type 1a ( AT1aR) / AT2R expression ratio was increased.	"angiotensin II	6	20	Chemical/Drug"	"angiotensin II	6	20	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""angiotensin II"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""angiotensin II"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The fetal kidneys in the PCE group displayed an enlarged Bowman ' s space and a shrunken glomerular tuft, accompanied by a reduced cortex width and an increase in the nephrogenic zone / cortical zone ratio.	[]
Observation by electronic microscope revealed structural damage of podocytes; the reduced expression level of podocyte marker genes, nephrin and podocin, was also detected by q - PCR.	[]
Moreover, AT2R gene and protein expressions in fetal kidneys were inhibited by PCE, associated with the repression of the gene expression of glial - cell - line - derived neurotrophic factor ( GDNF) / tyrosine kinase receptor ( c - Ret) signaling pathway.	"tyrosine	201	209	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""tyrosine"", ""start_span"": 201, ""end_span"": 209, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
These results demonstrated that PCE could induce dysplasia of fetal kidneys as well as glomerulosclerosis of adult offspring, and the low functional programming of renal AT2R might mediate the developmental origin of adult glomerulosclerosis.	[]
1, 3 - Butadiene, CML and the t ( 9: 22) translocation: A reality check.	[]
UNASSIGNED: Epidemiological studies of 1, 3 - butadiene have suggest that exposures to humans are associated with chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML).	[]
CML has a well - documented association with ionizing radiation, but reports of associations with chemical exposures have been questioned.	[]
Ionizing radiation is capable of inducing the requisite CML - associated t ( 9: 22) translocation ( Philadelphia chromosome) in appropriate cells in vitro but, thus far, chemicals have not shown this capacity.	[]
We have proposed that 1, 3 - butadiene metabolites be so tested as a reality check on the epidemiological reports.	[]
In order to conduct reliable testing in this regard, it is essential that a positive control for induction be available.	[]
We have used ionizing radiation to develop such a control.	[]
Results described here demonstrate that this agent does in fact induce pathogenic t ( 9: 22) translocations in a human myeloid cell line in vitro, but does so at low frequencies.	[]
Conditions that will be required for studies of 1, 3 - butadiene are discussed.	[]

The Agricultural Health Study ( AHS) is a prospective cohort study including licensed private and commercial pesticide applicators in Iowa and North Carolina enrolled 1993 - 1997.	[]
We evaluated cancer incidence through 2010 / 2011 ( NC / IA) for 49, 616 applicators, 53% of whom reported ever using metolachlor.	"metolachlor	118	129	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""metolachlor"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We used Poisson regression to evaluate relations between two metrics of metolachlor use ( lifetime days, intensity - weighted lifetime days) and cancer incidence.	"metolachlor	72	83	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""metolachlor"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We saw no association between metolachlor use and incidence of all cancers combined ( n = 5, 701 with a 5 - year lag) or most site - specific cancers.	"metolachlor	30	41	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""metolachlor"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
For liver cancer, in analyses restricted to exposed workers, elevations observed at higher categories of use were not statistically significant.	[]
However, trends for both lifetime and intensity - weighted lifetime days of metolachor use were positive and statistically significant with an unexposed reference group.	"metolachor	76	86	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""metolachor"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
A similar pattern was observed for follicular cell lymphoma, but no other lymphoma subtypes.	[]
An earlier suggestion of increased lung cancer risk at high levels of metolachlor use in this cohort was not confirmed in this update.	"metolachlor	70	81	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""metolachlor"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
This suggestion of an association between metolachlor and liver cancer among pesticide applicators is a novel finding and echoes observation of increased liver neoplasms in some animal studies.

BACKGROUND: Millions of individuals worldwide, particularly those living in rural and developing areas, are exposed to harmful levels of inorganic arsenic ( iAs) in their drinking water.

Inorganic As exposure during key developmental periods is associated with a variety of adverse health effects including those that are evident in adulthood.	"Inorganic As	0	12	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Inorganic As"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
There is considerable interest in identifying the molecular mechanisms that relate early - life iAs exposure to the development of these latent diseases, particularly in relationship to cancer.	"iAs	96	99	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""iAs"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
OBJECTIVES: This work summarizes research on the molecular mechanisms that underlie the increased risk of cancer development in adulthood that is associated with early - life iAs exposure.	"iAs	175	178	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""iAs"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
DISCUSSION: Epigenetic reprogramming that imparts functional changes in gene expression, the development of cancer stem cells, and immunomodulation are plausible underlying mechanisms by which early - life iAs exposure elicits latent carcinogenic effects.	"iAs	206	209	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""iAs"", ""start_span"": 206, ""end_span"": 209, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

An 80 year old diabetic male with evidence of peripheral and autonomic neuropathy was admitted with chest pain.	[]
He was found to have atrial flutter at a ventricular rate of 70 / min which slowed down to 30 - 40 / min when nifedipine ( 60 mg) in 3 divided doses, during which he was paced at a rate of 70 / min.

In this model, toxic effects were induced by intraperitoneal ( i. p.) injection of amphetamine 75 mg / kg ( 100% death rate) or cocaine 70 mg / kg ( 82% death rate).

PPA, 75 mg alone, increased blood pressure ( 31 + / - 14 mm Hg systolic, 20 + / - 5 mm Hg diastolic), and propranolol pretreatment antagonized this increase ( 12 + / - 10 mm Hg systolic, 10 + / - 7 mm Hg diastolic).

Left ventricular function ( assessed by echocardiography) showed that PPA increased the stroke volume 30% ( from 62. 5 + / - 20. 9 to 80. 8 + / - 22. 4 ml), the ejection fraction 9% ( from 64% + / - 10% to 70% + / - 7%), and cardiac output 14% ( from 3. 6 + / - 0. 6 to 4. 1 + / - 1. 0 L / min).

Systemic vascular resistance was increased by PPA 28% ( from 1710 + / - 200 to 2190 + / - 700 dyne X sec / cm5) and was further increased by propranolol 22% ( to 2660 + / - 1200 dyne X sec / cm5).

We conclude that PPA increases blood pressure by increasing systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output, and that propranolol antagonizes this increase by reversing the effect of PPA on cardiac output.

That propranolol antagonizes the pressor effect of PPA is in contrast to the interaction in which propranolol enhances the pressor effect of norepinephrine.

A controversy has existed for several years concerning the physiological relevance of the nicotinic receptor measured by alpha - bungarotoxin binding.	[]
Using mice derived from a classical F2 and backcross genetic design, a relationship between nicotine - induced seizures and alpha - bungarotoxin nicotinic receptor concentration was found.

Therefore, the effect of bis ( p - nitrophenyl) phosphate ( BNPP), an acylamidase inhibitor, on APAP and PAP nephrotoxicity and metabolism was determined.

Pretreatment of animals with BNPP prior to APAP or PAP administration resulted in marked reduction of APAP ( 900 mg / kg) nephrotoxicity but not PAP nephrotoxicity.

BNPP did not alter the excretion of APAP or any of its non - deacetylated metabolites nor did BNPP alter excretion of PAP or its metabolites after PAP doses of 150 and 300 mg / kg.

High doses caused an apparent central excitation, most clearly seen as clonic convulsions, superimposed on general depression.	[]
Following a lethal dose, death was always associated with convulsions.	[]
Comparing the relative sensitivity to central depression and excitation revealed that rats were least likely to have convulsions at doses that did not first cause loss of consciousness, while cats most clearly showed marked central excitatory actions.	[]

The investigation was discontinued after 18 patients because of the frequency and intensity of side - effects, particularly pain and myoclonia, which caused the technique to be abandoned in two cases.	[]
It is considered unlikely that etomidate will prove to be the hypnotic of choice for a totally intravenous anesthetic technique in adults because of the high incidence of myoclonia after prolonged administration.

Maximal exercise heart rate was reduced from 187 + / - 4 ( SEM) after placebo to 146 + / - 7 bpm after atenolol and 138 + / - 6 bpm after propranolol, but there were no differences between the drugs.

Isoproterenol sensitivity was determined as the intravenous dose that increased heart rate by 25 bpm ( CD25) and this was increased from 1. 8 + / - 0. 3 micrograms after placebo to 38. 9 + / - 8. 3 micrograms after propranolol and 8. 3 + / - 1. 7 micrograms after atenolol.

The difference in the effects of the two was significant.	[]
After atropine the CD25 was unchanged after placebo ( 2. 3 + / - 0. 3 micrograms) and atenolol ( 7. 7 + / - 1. 3 micrograms); it was reduced after propranolol ( 24. 8 + / - 5. 0 micrograms), but remained different from atenolol.

This change with propranolol sensitivity was calculated as the apparent Ka, this was unchanged by atropine ( 11. 7 + / - 2. 1 and 10. 1 + / - 2. 5 ml / ng).

These data are consistent with the hypothesis that exercise - induced tachycardia results largely from beta 1 - receptor activation that is blocked by both cardioselective and nonselective drugs, whereas isoproterenol activates both beta 1 - and beta 2 - receptors so that after cardioselective blockade there remains a beta 2 - component that can be blocked with a nonselective drug.

The mean treatment period was 18 months.	[]
During the follow - up period, attention was paid to breast modifications as evidenced by symptomatology, physical examination, and plate thermography.	[]
Mastodynia was reported by 21 patients, and physical examination revealed a light increase in breast firmness in 12 women and a moderate increase in breast nodularity in 2 women.	[]
Themography confirmed the existence of an excessive breast stimulation in 1 women who complained of moderate mastodynia and in 5 of the 7 women who complained of severe mastodynia.	[]

The electrocardiogram showed alternation of long and short P - P intervals and occasional pauses.	[]
These pauses were always preceded by the short P - P intervals and were usually followed by one or two P - P intervals of 0. 92 - 0. 95 s representing the basic sinus cycle.	[]
Following these basic sinus cycles, alternating rhythm started with the longer P - P interval.	[]
The long P - P intervals ranged between 1. 04 - 1. 12 s and the short P - P intervals between 0. 80 - 0. 84 s, respectively.	[]
The duration of the pauses were equal or almost equal to one short plus one long P - P interval or to twice the basic sinus cycle.	[]
In one recording a short period of regular sinus rhythm with intermittent 2 / 1 S - A block was observed.	[]
This short period of sinus rhythm was interrupted by sudden prolongation of the P - P interval starting the alternative rhythm.	[]
There were small changes in the shape of the P waves and P - R intervals.	[]
S - A conduction through two pathways, the first with 2 / 1 block the second having 0. 12 - 0. 14 s longer conduction time and with occasional 2 / 1 block was proposed for the explanation of the alternating P - P interval and other electrocardiographic features seen.	[]

Experimental progressive muscular dystrophy and its treatment with high doses anabolizing agents.	[]
We are still a long way from discovering an unequivocal pathogenetic interpretation of progressive muscular dystrophy in man.	[]
Noteworthy efforts have been made in the experimental field; a recessive autosomic form found in the mouse seems to bear the closest resemblance to the human form from the genetic point of view.	[]
Myopathy due to lack of vitamin E and myopathy induced by certain viruses have much in common anatomically and pathologically with the human form.	"vitamin E	24	33	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""vitamin E"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

It is thus confirmed that the histological characteristics of myopathic rat muscle induced experimentally are extraordinarily similar to those of human myopathy as confirmed during biopsies performed at the Orthopaedic Traumatological Centre, Florence.	[]

"In this way they obtained appreciable changes in body weight ( increased from 50 to 70 g after forty days at a dose of 5 mg per day of anabolizing agent), but most of all they found histological changes due to "" regenerative "" changes in the muscle tissue, which however maintained its myopathic characteristics in the control animals that were not treated with the anabolizing agent."	[]
"The authors conclude by affirming the undoubted efficacy of the anabolizing steroids in experimental myopathic disease, but they have reservations as to the transfer of the results into the human field, where high dosage cannot be carried out continuously because of the effects of the drug on virility; because the tissue injury too often occurs at an irreversible stage vis - a - vis the "" regeneration "" of the muscle tissue; and finally because the dystrophic injurious agent is certainly not the lack of vitamin E but something as yet unknown."

Parameters of renal hemodynamics and tubular sodium and water handling were assessed by clearance techniques in 26 well compensated cirrhotic patients before and after an oral combination of 50 mg of indomethacin and various doses of misoprostol.

Transvenous right ventricular pacing during cardiopulmonary resuscitation of pediatric patients with acute cardiomyopathy.	[]
We describe the cardiopulmonary resuscitation efforts on five patients who presented in acute circulatory failure from myocardial dysfunction.	[]
Three patients had acute viral myocarditis, one had a carbamazepine - induced acute eosinophilic myocarditis, and one had cardiac hemosiderosis resulting in acute cardiogenic shock.	"carbamazepine	54	67	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""carbamazepine"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
All patients were continuously monitored with central venous and arterial catheters in addition to routine noninvasive monitoring.	[]
An introducer sheath, a pacemaker, and sterile pacing wires were made readily available for the patients, should the need arise to terminate resistant cardiac dysrhythmias.	[]
All patients developed cardiocirculatory arrest associated with extreme hypotension and dysrhythmias within the first 48 hours of their admission to the pediatric intensive care unit ( PICU).	[]
Right ventricular pacemaker wires were inserted in all of them during cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR).	[]
In four patients, cardiac pacing was used, resulting in a temporary captured rhythm and restoration of their cardiac output.	[]
These patients had a second event of cardiac arrest, resulting in death, within 10 to 60 minutes.	[]
In one patient, cardiac pacing was not used, because he converted to normal sinus rhythm by electrical defibrillation within three minutes of initiating CPR.	[]
We conclude that cardiac pacing during resuscitative efforts in pediatric patients suffering from acute myocardial dysfunction may not have long - term value in and of itself; however, if temporary hemodynamic stability is achieved by this procedure, it may provide additional time needed to institute other therapeutic modalities.

PURPOSE: To assess the antiemetic effects and safety profile of four different doses of granisetron ( Kytril; SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, Philadelphia, PA) when administered as a single intravenous ( IV) dose for prophylaxis of cisplatin - induced nausea and vomiting.	"granisetron	88	99	Chemical/Drug"	"Kytril	102	108	Chemical/Drug"	"cisplatin	236	245	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""granisetron"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""Kytril"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""cisplatin"", ""start_span"": 236, ""end_span"": 245, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred eighty - four chemotherapy - naive patients receiving high - dose cisplatin ( 81 to 120 mg / m2) were randomized to receive one of four granisetron doses ( 5, 10, 20, or 40 micrograms / kg) administered before chemotherapy.

Patients were observed on an inpatient basis for 18 to 24 hours, and vital signs, nausea, vomiting, retching, and appetite were assessed.	[]
Safety analyses included incidence of adverse experiences and laboratory parameter changes.	[]
RESULTS: After granisetron doses of 5, 10, 20, and 40 micrograms / kg, a major response ( < or = two vomiting or retching episodes, and no antiemetic rescue) was recorded in 23%, 57%, 58%, and 60% of patients, respectively, and a complete response ( no vomiting or retching, and no antiemetic rescue) in 18%, 41%, 40%, and 47% of patients, respectively.

There was a statistically longer time to first episode of nausea ( P =. 0015) and vomiting ( P =. 0001), and fewer patients were administered additional antiemetic medication in the 10 - micrograms / kg dosing groups than in the 5 - micrograms / kg dosing group.	[]
As granisetron dose increased, appetite return increased ( P =. 040).	"granisetron	3	14	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""granisetron"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Headache was the most frequently reported adverse event ( 20%).	[]
CONCLUSION: A single 10 -, 20 -, or 40 - micrograms / kg dose of granisetron was effective in controlling vomiting in 57% to 60% of patients who received cisplatin at doses greater than 81 mg / m2 and totally prevented vomiting in 40% to 47% of patients.

Administration of GM at 40 mg / kg sc for 13 days to rats induced a significant reduction in renal blood flow ( RBF) and inulin clearance ( CIn) as well as marked tubular damage.	"GM	18	20	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""GM"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
A significant reduction in urinary guanosine 3 ', 5 ' - cyclic monophosphate ( cGMP) excretion and a significant increase in renal cortical renin and endothelin - 1 contents were also observed in GM - mediated nephropathy.

The SOD - induced increase in glomerular filtration rate was associated with a marked improvement in RBF, an increase in urinary cGMP excretion, and a decrease in renal renin and endothelin - 1 content.	"cGMP	129	133	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cGMP"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

The influence of L - dopa on the renal excretion of potassium was studied in 3 patients with hypokalemia and in 5 normokalemic patients by determination of renal plasma flow, glomerular filtration rate, plasma concentration of potassium and sodium as well as urinary excretion of potassium, sodium and aldosterone.

This effect on the renal function could be prohibited by the administration of a peripheral dopa decarbodylase inhibitor.	[]
It is not known why this effect occurred in some individuals but not in others, but our results indicate a correlation between aldosterone production and this renal effect of L - dopa.

A new model to test potential protectors.	[]
In laboratory animals, histology is most commonly used to study doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity.	"doxorubicin	64	75	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""doxorubicin"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
However, for monitoring during treatment, large numbers of animals are needed.	[]
Recently we developed a new method to measure ECG values in freely moving mice by telemetry.	[]
With this model we investigated the effect of chronic doxorubicin administration on the ECG of freely moving BALB / c mice and the efficacy of ICRF - 187 as a protective agent.	"doxorubicin	54	65	Chemical/Drug"	"ICRF - 187	143	153	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""doxorubicin"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""ICRF - 187"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The ST interval significantly widened from 15. 0 + / - 1. 5 to 56. 8 + / - 11. 8 ms in week 10 ( 7 weekly doses of 4 mg / kg doxorubicin given i. v. plus 3 weeks of observation).

As this schedule exerted more toxicity than needed to investigate protective agents, the protection of ICRF - 187 was determined using a dose schedule with lower general toxicity ( 6 weekly doses of 4 mg / kg doxorubicin given i. v. plus 2 weeks of observation).	"ICRF - 187	103	113	Chemical/Drug"	"doxorubicin	209	220	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ICRF - 187"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""doxorubicin"", ""start_span"": 209, ""end_span"": 220, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
On this schedule, the animals ' hearts appeared normal after sacrifice and ICRF - 187 ( 50 mg / kg given i. p. 1 h before doxorubicin) provided almost full protection.

These data were confirmed by histology.	[]
The results indicate that this new model is very sensitive and enables monitoring of the development of cardiotoxicity with time.	[]
These findings result in a model that allows the testing of protectors against doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity as demonstrated by the protection provided by ICRF - 187.

Since bupivacaine and epinephrine may both precipitate dysrhythmias, circulating bupivacaine during regional anesthesia could potentiate dysrhythmogenic effects of epinephrine.

Experimental animals ( n = 6) received rhIGF - I, 400 micrograms / d, whereas control rats ( n = 6) received the vehicle.	[]
rhIGF - I improved weight gain by 14% ( p < 0. 05), without altering hematocrit or blood pressure in rats with renal disease.	[]

"PAN	162	165	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""PAN"", ""start_span"": 162, ""end_span"": 165, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The improvement in GFR was not associated with enhanced glomerular hypertrophy or increased segmental glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial injury, or renal cortical malondialdehyde content.

The drug was given for 4 weeks.	[]
The patients were closely monitored clinically, biochemically, and serologically up to 4 weeks after drug treatment.	[]
All 36 patients receiving lamivudine had a decrease in hepatitis B virus ( HBV) DNA values of > 90% ( P <. 001 compared with placebo).	"lamivudine	26	36	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""lamivudine"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Although 25 mg of lamivudine was slightly less effective than 100 mg ( P =. 011) and 300 mg ( P =. 005), it still induced 94% suppression of HBV DNA after the fourth week of therapy.

HBV DNA values returned to pretreatment levels within 4 weeks of cessation of therapy.	[]
There was no change in the hepatitis B e antigen status or in aminotransferase levels.	[]
No serious adverse events were observed.	[]
In conclusion, a 4 - week course of lamivudine was safe and effective in suppression of HBV DNA in Chinese HBsAg carriers.

BACKGROUND: Four studies published since December, 1995, reported that the incidence of venous thromboembolism ( VTE) was higher in women who used oral contraceptives ( OCs) containing the third - generation progestagens gestodene or desogestrel than in users of OCs containing second - generation progestagens.

However, confounding and bias in the design of these studies may have affected the findings.	[]
The aim of our study was to re - examine the association between risk of VTE and OC use with a different study design and analysis to avoid some of the bias and confounding of the earlier studies.	"OC	81	83	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""OC"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METHODS: We used computer records of patients from 143 general practices in the UK.	[]
The study was based on the medical records of about 540, 000 women born between 1941 and 1981.	[]
All women who had a recorded diagnosis of deep - vein thrombosis, venous thrombosis not otherwise specified, or pulmonary embolus during the study period, and who had been treated with an anticoagulant were identified as potential cases of VTE.	[]
We did a cohort analysis to estimate and compare incidence of VTE in users of the main OC preparations, and a nested case - control study to calculate the odds ratios of VTE associated with use of different types of OC, after adjustment for potential confounding factors.

In the case - control study, we matched cases to controls by exact year of birth, practice, and current use of OCs.	"OCs	111	114	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""OCs"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We used a multiple logistic regression model that included body - mass index, number of cycles, change in type of OC prescribed within 3 months of the event, previous pregnancy, and concurrent disease.

FINDINGS: 85 women met the inclusion criteria for VTE, two of whom were users of progestagen - only OCs.	"progestagen	81	92	Chemical/Drug"	"OCs	100	103	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""progestagen"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""OCs"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Of the 83 cases of VTE associated with use of combined OCs, 43 were recorded as deep - vein thrombosis, 35 as pulmonary thrombosis, and five as venous thrombosis not otherwise specified.	"OCs	55	58	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""OCs"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The crude rate of VTE per 10, 000 woman - years was 4. 10 in current users of any OC, 3. 10 in users of second - generation OCs, and 4. 96 in users of third - generation preparations.

After adjustment for age, the rate ratio of VTE in users of third - generation relative to second - generation OCs was 1. 68 ( 95% CI 1. 04 - 2. 75).	"OCs	111	114	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""OCs"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Logistic regression showed no significant difference in the risk of VTE between users of third - generation and second - generation OCs.	"OCs	132	135	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""OCs"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Among users of third - generation progestagens, the risk of VTE was higher in users of desogestrel with 20 g ethinyloestradiol than in users of gestodene or desogestrel with 30 g ethinyloestradiol.

With all second - generation OCs as the reference, the odds ratios for VTE were 3. 49 ( 1. 21 - 10. 12) for desogestrel plus 20 g ethinyloestradiol and 1. 18 ( 0. 66 - 2. 17) for the other third - generation progestagens.

INTERPRETATION: The previously reported increase in odds ratio associated with third - generation OCs when compared with second - generation products is likely to have been the result of residual confounding by age.

The increased odds ratio associated with products containing 20 micrograms ethinyloestradiol and desogestrel compared with the 30 micrograms product is biologically implausible, and is likely to be the result of preferential prescribing and, thus, confounding.

Efficacy and proarrhythmia with the use of d, l - sotalol for sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias.	[]
This study prospectively evaluated the clinical efficacy, the incidence of torsades de pointes, and the presumable risk factors for torsades de pointes in patients treated with d, l - sotalol for sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias.	[]
Eighty - one consecutive patients ( 54 with coronary artery disease, and 20 with dilated cardiomyopathy) with inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation received oral d, l - sotalol to prevent induction of the ventricular tachyarrhythmia.	[]
During oral loading with d, l - sotalol, continuous electrocardiographic ( ECG) monitoring was performed.	[]
Those patients in whom d, l - sotalol prevented induction of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation were discharged with the drug and followed up on an outpatient basis for 21 + / - 18 months.	[]
Induction of the ventricular tachyarrhythmia was prevented by oral d, l - sotalol in 35 ( 43%) patients; the ventricular tachyarrhythmia remained inducible in 40 ( 49%) patients; and two ( 2. 5%) patients did not tolerate even 40 mg of d, l - sotalol once daily.	[]
Four ( 5%) patients had from torsades de pointes during the initial oral treatment with d, l - sotalol.	[]
Neither ECG [ sinus - cycle length ( SCL), QT or QTc interval, or U wave] nor clinical parameters identified patients at risk for torsades de pointes.	[]
However, the oral dose of d, l - sotalol was significantly lower in patients with torsades de pointes ( 200 + / - 46 vs. 328 + / - 53 mg / day; p = 0. 0017).	[]
Risk factors associated with the development of torsades de pointes were the appearance of an U wave ( p = 0. 049), female gender ( p = 0. 015), and significant dose - corrected changes of SCL, QT interval, and QTc interval ( p < 0. 05).	[]
During follow - up, seven ( 20%) patients had a nonfatal ventricular tachycardia recurrence, and two ( 6%) patients died suddenly.	[]
One female patient with stable cardiac disease had recurrent torsades de pointes after 2 years of successful treatment with d, l - sotalol.	[]
Torsades de pointes occurred early during treatment even with low doses of oral d, l - sotalol.	[]
Pronounced changes in the surface ECG ( cycle length, QT, and QTc) in relation to the dose of oral d, l - sotalol might identify a subgroup of patients with an increased risk for torsades de pointes.	[]
Other ECG parameters before the application of d, l - sotalol did not identify patients at increased risk for torsades de pointes.	[]
Recurrence rates of ventricular tachyarrhythmias are high despite complete suppression of the arrhythmia during programmed stimulation.	[]
Therefore programmed electrical stimulation in the case of d, l - sotalol seems to be of limited prognostic value.	[]

The tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic ( TIDA) system is known to inhibit prolactin ( PRL) secretion.	[]
In young animals this system responds to acute elevations in serum PRL by increasing its activity.	[]
However, this responsiveness is lost in aging rats with chronically high serum PRL levels.	[]
The purpose of this study was to induce hyperprolactinemia in rats for extended periods of time and examine its effects on dopaminergic systems in the brain.	[]
Hyperprolactinemia was induced by treatment with haloperidol, a dopamine receptor antagonist, and Palkovits ' microdissection technique in combination with high - performance liquid chromatography was used to measure neurotransmitter concentrations in several areas of the brain.

The negative mucosal potential: separating central and peripheral effects of NSAIDs in man.	[]
OBJECTIVE: We wanted to test whether assessment of both a central pain - related signal ( chemo - somatosensory evoked potential, CSSEP) and a concomitantly recorded peripheral signal ( negative mucosal potential, NMP) allows for separation of central and peripheral effects of NSAIDs.	[]
For this purpose, experimental conditions were created in which NSAIDs had previously been observed to produce effects on phasic and tonic pain by either central or peripheral mechanisms.	[]
METHODS: According to a double - blind, randomised, controlled, threefold cross - over design, 18 healthy subjects ( 11 males, 7 females; mean age 26 years) received either placebo, 400 mg ibuprofen, or 800 mg ibuprofen.	"ibuprofen	189	198	Chemical/Drug"	"ibuprofen	189	198	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ibuprofen"", ""start_span"": 189, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""ibuprofen"", ""start_span"": 189, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Phasic pain was applied by means of short pulses of CO2 to the nasal mucosa ( stimulus duration 500 ms, interval approximately 60 s), and tonic pain was induced in the nasal cavity by means of dry air of controlled temperature, humidity and flow rate ( 22 degrees C, 0% relative humidity, 145 ml. s - 1).	"CO2	52	55	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""CO2"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Additionally, the subjects rated the intensity of both phasic and tonic pain by means of visual analogue scales.	[]
RESULTS: As described earlier, administration of ibuprofen was followed by a decrease in tonic pain but - relative to placebo - an increase in correlates of phasic pain, indicating a specific effect of ibuprofen on the interaction between the pain stimuli under these special experimental conditions.	"ibuprofen	49	58	Chemical/Drug"	"ibuprofen	49	58	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ibuprofen"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""ibuprofen"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Based on the similar behaviour of CSSEP and NMP, it was concluded that the pharmacological process underlying this phenomenon was localised in the periphery.	[]
By means of the simultaneous recording of interrelated peripheral and central electrophysiologic correlates of nociception, it was possible to separate central and peripheral effects of an NSAID.	[]
The major advantage of this pain model is the possibility of obtaining peripheral pain - related activity directly using a non - invasive technique in humans.	[]

Dosage groups of 15, 30, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175 or 200 microg carbetocin were assigned to blocks of three women according to the continual reassessment method ( CRM).	"carbetocin	66	76	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""carbetocin"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
RESULTS: All dosage groups consisted of three women, except those with 100 microg ( n = 6) and 200 microg ( n = 18).	[]
Recorded were dose - limiting adverse events: hyper - or hypotension ( three), severe abdominal pain ( 0), vomiting ( 0) and retained placenta ( four).	[]
Serious adverse events occurred in seven women: six cases with blood loss > or = 1000 ml, four cases of manual placenta removal, five cases of additional oxytocics administration and five cases of blood transfusion.	[]
Maximum blood loss was greatest at the upper and lower dose levels, and lowest in the 70 - 125 microg dose range.	[]
Four out of six cases with blood loss > or = 1000 ml occurred in the 200 microg group.	[]
The majority of additional administration of oxytocics ( 4 / 5) and blood transfusion ( 3 / 5) occurred in the dose groups of 200 microg.	[]
All retained placentae were found in the group of 200 microg.	[]
CONCLUSION: The MTD was calculated to be at 200 microg carbetocin.	"carbetocin	55	65	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""carbetocin"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Pallidotomy with the gamma knife: a positive experience.	[]
51 patients with medically refractory Parkinson ' s disease underwent stereotactic posteromedial pallidotomy between August 1993 and February 1997 for treatment of bradykinesia, rigidity, and L - DOPA - induced dyskinesias.	"L - DOPA	192	200	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""L - DOPA"", ""start_span"": 192, ""end_span"": 200, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In 29 patients, the pallidotomies were performed with the Leksell Gamma Knife and in 22 they were performed with the standard radiofrequency ( RF) method.	[]
Clinical assessment as well as blinded ratings of Unified Parkinson ' s Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS) scores were carried out pre - and postoperatively.	[]
Mean follow - up time is 20. 6 months ( range 6 - 48) and all except 4 patients have been followed more than one year.	[]
85 percent of patients with dyskinesias were relieved of symptoms, regardless of whether the pallidotomies were performed with the Gamma Knife or radiofrequency methods.	[]
About 2 / 3 of the patients in both Gamma Knife and radiofrequency groups showed improvements in bradykinesia and rigidity, although when considered as a group neither the Gamma Knife nor the radiofrequency group showed statistically significant improvements in UPDRS scores.	[]
One patient in the Gamma Knife group ( 3. 4%) developed a homonymous hemianopsia 9 months following treatment and 5 patients ( 27. 7%) in the radiofrequency group became transiently confused postoperatively.	[]
No other complications were seen.	[]
Gamma Knife pallidotomy is as effective as radiofrequency pallidotomy in controlling certain of the symptoms of Parkinson ' s disease.	[]
It may be the only practical technique available in certain patients, such as those who take anticoagulants, have bleeding diatheses or serious systemic medical illnesses.	[]
It is a viable option for other patients as well.	[]
Centrally mediated cardiovascular effects of intracisternal application of carbachol in anesthetized rats.	"carbachol	75	84	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""carbachol"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The pressor response to the intracisternal ( i. c.) injection of carbachol ( 1 mug) in anesthetized rats was analyzed.	"carbachol	65	74	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""carbachol"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
This response was significantly reduced by the intravenous ( i. v.) injection of guanethidine ( 5 mg), hexamethonium ( 10 mg) or phentolamine ( 5 mg), and conversely, potentiated by i. v. desmethylimipramine ( 0. 3 mg), while propranolol ( 0. 5 mg) i. v. selectively inhibited the enlargement of pulse pressure and the tachycardia following i. c. carbachol ( 1 mug).

She had defects in the supratentorial brain including the basal ganglia and the striatum ( multicystic encephalomalacia) due to severe perinatal hypoxic - ischemic encephalopathy, which was considered to be a possible predisposing factor causing neuroleptic malignant syndrome.	[]
A dopaminergic blockade mechanism generally is accepted as the pathogenesis of this syndrome.	[]
However, methylphenidate is a dopamine agonist via the inhibition of uptake of dopamine, and therefore dopaminergic systems in the brainstem ( mainly the midbrain) and the spinal cord were unlikely to participate in the onset of this syndrome.

Seven of the 13 patients had exhibited a subclinical hypertensive state before cyclosporin A therapy.	"cyclosporin A	79	92	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cyclosporin A"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures of these 13 patients were decreased significantly after 4 weeks of nifedipine therapy, and blood pressure was maintained within the normal range thereafter for 25 months.

The adverse events during combined therapy with cyclosporin A and nifedipine included an increase in blood urea nitrogen levels in 9 of the 13 patients and development of gingival hyperplasia in 2 of the 13 patients.

Our findings indicate that sustained - release nifedipine is useful for hypertensive psoriatic patients under long - term treatment with cyclosporin A, but that these patients should be monitored for gingival hyperplasia.
