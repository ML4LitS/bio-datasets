This unwanted effect on postural blood pressure was not the result of underlying autonomic failure.	[]
The aims of this study were to confirm our previous findings in a separate cohort of patients and to determine the time course of the cardiovascular consequences of stopping selegiline in the expectation that this might shed light on the mechanisms by which the drug causes orthostatic hypotension.	"selegiline	174	184	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""selegiline"", ""start_span"": 174, ""end_span"": 184, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METHODS: The cardiovascular responses to standing and head - up tilt were studied repeatedly in PD patients receiving selegiline and as the drug was withdrawn.	"selegiline	118	128	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""selegiline"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
RESULTS: Head - up tilt caused systolic orthostatic hypotension which was marked in six of 20 PD patients on selegiline, one of whom lost consciousness with unrecordable blood pressures.

A lesser degree of orthostatic hypotension occurred with standing.	[]
Orthostatic hypotension was ameliorated 4 days after withdrawal of selegiline and totally abolished 7 days after discontinuation of the drug.	"selegiline	67	77	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""selegiline"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Stopping selegiline also significantly reduced the supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures consistent with a previously undescribed supine pressor action.	"selegiline	9	19	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""selegiline"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
CONCLUSION: This study confirms our previous finding that selegiline in combination with L - dopa is associated with selective orthostatic hypotension.

The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of TET and FAN on the experimental thrombosis induced by collagen plus epinephrine ( EP) in mice, and platelet aggregation and blood coagulation in vitro.

In the in vivo study, the administration ( 50 mg / kg, i. p.) of TET and FAN in mice showed the inhibition of thrombosis by 55% and 35%, respectively, while acetylsalicylic acid ( ASA, 50 mg / kg, i. p.), a positive control, showed only 30% inhibition.	"TET	65	68	Chemical/Drug"	"FAN	73	76	Chemical/Drug"	"acetylsalicylic acid	157	177	Chemical/Drug"	"ASA	180	183	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""TET"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""FAN"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""acetylsalicylic acid"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 177, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""ASA"", ""start_span"": 180, ""end_span"": 183, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In the vitro human platelet aggregations induced by the agonists used in tests, TET and FAN showed the inhibitions dose dependently.

In addition, neither TET nor FAN showed any anticoagulation activities in the measurement of the activated partial thromboplastin time ( APTT), prothrombin time ( PT) and thrombin time ( TT) using human - citrated plasma.

This paper attempts to examine and compare prevalence rates and symptom patterns of DSM substance - induced and other mood disorders.	[]
243 cocaine - dependent outpatients with cocaine - induced mood disorder ( CIMD), other mood disorders, or no mood disorder were compared on measures of psychiatric symptoms.

The prevalence rate for CIMD was 12% at baseline.	[]
Introduction of the DSM - IV diagnosis of CIMD did not substantially affect rates of the other depressive disorders.	[]
Patients with CIMD had symptom severity levels between those of patients with and without a mood disorder.	[]
These findings suggest some validity for the new DSM - IV diagnosis of CIMD, but also suggest that it requires further specification and replication.	[]
Effect of fucoidan treatment on collagenase - induced intracerebral hemorrhage in rats.	"fucoidan	10	18	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""fucoidan"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Inflammatory cells are postulated to mediate some of the brain damage following ischemic stroke.	[]
Intracerebral hemorrhage is associated with more inflammation than ischemic stroke.	[]
We tested the sulfated polysaccharide fucoidan, which has been reported to reduce inflammatory brain damage, in a rat model of intracerebral hemorrhage induced by injection of bacterial collagenase into the caudate nucleus.	"fucoidan	38	46	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""fucoidan"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

The hematoma was assessed in vivo by magnetic resonance imaging.	[]
Motor behavior, passive avoidance, and skilled forelimb function were tested repeatedly for six weeks.	[]
Fucoidan - treated rats exhibited evidence of impaired blood clotting and hemodilution, had larger hematomas, and tended to have less inflammation in the vicinity of the hematoma after three days.	"Fucoidan	0	8	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Fucoidan"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
They showed significantly more rapid improvement of motor function in the first week following hemorrhage and better memory retention in the passive avoidance test.	[]
Acute white matter edema and eventual neuronal loss in the striatum adjacent to the hematoma did not differ between the two groups.	[]
Investigation of more specific anti - inflammatory agents and hemodiluting agents are warranted in intracerebral hemorrhage.	[]

The addition of ephedrine to propofol appears to be an effective method of obtunding the hypotensive response to propofol at all doses used in this study.

BACKGROUND: Although the prevalence of nonsmall cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC) is high among elderly patients, few data are available regarding the efficacy and toxicity of chemotherapy in this group of patients.	[]
Recent reports indicate that single agent therapy with vinorelbine ( VNB) or gemcitabine ( GEM) may obtain a response rate of 20 - 30% in elderly patients, with acceptable toxicity and improvement in symptoms and quality of life.

In the current study the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of GEM and VNB in elderly patients with advanced NSCLC or those with some contraindication to receiving cisplatin were assessed.

All patients were evaluable for response and toxicity.	[]
Treatment was comprised of VNB, 25 mg / m ( 2), plus GEM, 1000 mg / m ( 2), both on Days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days.

Patients received a minimum of three courses unless progressive disease was detected.	[]
RESULTS: One hundred sixty - five courses were administered, with a median of 3.	[]
6 courses per patient.	[]
The overall response rate was 26% ( 95% confidence interval, 15 - 41%).	[]
Two patients attained a complete response ( 4%) and 11 patients ( 22%) achieved a partial response.	[]
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status improved in 35% of those patients with an initial value > 0, whereas relief of at least 1 symptom without worsening of other symptoms was noted in 27 patients ( 55%).	[]
The median time to progression was 16 weeks and the 1 - year survival rate was 33%.	[]
Toxicity was mild.	[]
Six patients ( 12%) had World Health Organization Grade 3 - 4 neutropenia, 2 patients ( 4%) had Grade 3 - 4 thrombocytopenia, and 2 patients ( 4%) had Grade 3 neurotoxicity.	[]
Three patients with severe neutropenia ( 6%) died of sepsis.	[]
The median age of those patients developing Grade 3 - 4 neutropenia was significantly higher than that of the remaining patients ( 75 years vs. 72 years; P = 0. 047).	[]
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of GEM and VNB is moderately active and well tolerated except in patients age > / = 75 years.

This age group had an increased risk of myelosuppression.	[]
Therefore the prophylactic use of granulocyte - colony stimulating factor should be considered with this treatment.	[]
New chemotherapy combinations with higher activity and lower toxicity are needed for elderly patients with advanced NSCLC.	[]

Warfarin - induced artery calcification is accelerated by growth and vitamin D.

The present studies demonstrate that growth and vitamin D treatment enhance the extent of artery calcification in rats given sufficient doses of Warfarin to inhibit gamma - carboxylation of matrix Gla protein, a calcification inhibitor known to be expressed by smooth muscle cells and macrophages in the artery wall.

The first series of experiments examined the influence of age and growth status on artery calcification in Warfarin - treated rats.	"Warfarin	107	115	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Warfarin"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Treatment for 2 weeks with Warfarin caused massive focal calcification of the artery media in 20 - day - old rats and less extensive focal calcification in 42 - day - old rats.	"Warfarin	27	35	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Warfarin"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In contrast, no artery calcification could be detected in 10 - month - old adult rats even after 4 weeks of Warfarin treatment.	"Warfarin	108	116	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Warfarin"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
To directly examine the importance of growth to Warfarin - induced artery calcification in animals of the same age, 20 - day - old rats were fed for 2 weeks either an ad libitum diet or a 6 - g / d restricted diet that maintains weight but prevents growth.	"Warfarin	48	56	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Warfarin"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Concurrent treatment of both dietary groups with Warfarin produced massive focal calcification of the artery media in the ad libitum - fed rats but no detectable artery calcification in the restricted - diet, growth - inhibited group.	"Warfarin	49	57	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Warfarin"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Although the explanation for the association between artery calcification and growth status cannot be determined from the present study, there was a relationship between higher serum phosphate and susceptibility to artery calcification, with 30% higher levels of serum phosphate in young, ad libitum - fed rats compared with either of the groups that was resistant to Warfarin - induced artery calcification, ie, the 10 - month - old rats and the restricted - diet, growth - inhibited young rats.

This observation suggests that increased susceptibility to Warfarin - induced artery calcification could be related to higher serum phosphate levels.

The second set of experiments examined the possible synergy between vitamin D and Warfarin in artery calcification.

High doses of vitamin D are known to cause calcification of the artery media in as little as 3 to 4 days.	"vitamin D	14	23	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""vitamin D"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
High doses of the vitamin K antagonist Warfarin are also known to cause calcification of the artery media, but at treatment times of 2 weeks or longer yet not at 1 week.	"vitamin K	18	27	Chemical/Drug"	"Warfarin	39	47	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""vitamin K"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""Warfarin"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In the current study, we investigated the synergy between these 2 treatments and found that concurrent Warfarin administration dramatically increased the extent of calcification in the media of vitamin D - treated rats at 3 and 4 days.	"Warfarin	103	111	Chemical/Drug"	"vitamin D	194	203	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Warfarin"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""vitamin D"", ""start_span"": 194, ""end_span"": 203, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
There was a close parallel between the effect of vitamin D dose on artery calcification and the effect of vitamin D dose on the elevation of serum calcium, which suggests that vitamin D may induce artery calcification through its effect on serum calcium.	"vitamin D	49	58	Chemical/Drug"	"vitamin D	49	58	Chemical/Drug"	"calcium	147	154	Chemical/Drug"	"vitamin D	49	58	Chemical/Drug"	"calcium	147	154	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""vitamin D"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""vitamin D"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""calcium"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""vitamin D"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""calcium"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Because Warfarin treatment had no effect on the elevation in serum calcium produced by vitamin D, the synergy between Warfarin and vitamin D is probably best explained by the hypothesis that Warfarin inhibits the activity of matrix Gla protein as a calcification inhibitor.	"Warfarin	8	16	Chemical/Drug"	"calcium	67	74	Chemical/Drug"	"vitamin D	87	96	Chemical/Drug"	"Warfarin	8	16	Chemical/Drug"	"vitamin D	87	96	Chemical/Drug"	"Warfarin	8	16	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Warfarin"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""calcium"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""vitamin D"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""Warfarin"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""vitamin D"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""Warfarin"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
High levels of matrix Gla protein are found at sites of artery calcification in rats treated with vitamin D plus Warfarin, and chemical analysis showed that the protein that accumulated was indeed not gamma - carboxylated.

These observations indicate that although the gamma - carboxyglutamate residues of matrix Gla protein are apparently required for its function as a calcification inhibitor, they are not required for its accumulation at calcification sites.

Test conditions influence the response to a drug challenge in rodents.	[]
These studies were conducted to examine the differential response to a drug challenge under varied experimental test conditions routinely employed to study drug - induced behavioral and neurophysiological responses in rodents.	[]
Apomorphine, a nonselective dopamine agonist, was selected due to its biphasic behavioral effects, its ability to induce hypothermia, and to produce distinct changes to dopamine turnover in the rodent brain.

From such experiments there is evidence that characterization and detection of apomorphine - induced activity in rodents critically depends upon the test conditions employed.	"apomorphine	79	90	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""apomorphine"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In rats, detection of apomorphine - induced hyperactivity was facilitated by a period of acclimatization to the test conditions.	"apomorphine	22	33	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""apomorphine"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Moreover, test conditions can impact upon other physiological responses to apomorphine such as drug - induced hypothermia.	"apomorphine	75	86	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""apomorphine"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In mice, apomorphine produced qualitatively different responses under novel conditions when compared to those behaviors elicited in the home test cage.	"apomorphine	9	20	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""apomorphine"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Drug - induced gross activity counts were increased in the novel exploratory box only, while measures of stereotypic behavior were similar in both.	[]

Dopamine turnover ratios ( DOPAC: DA and HVA: DA) were found to be lower in those animals exposed to the exploratory box when compared to their home cage counterparts.

The hemolytic effect of TAM is prevented by low concentrations of alpha - tocopherol ( alpha - T) and alpha - tocopherol acetate ( alpha - TAc) ( inactivated functional hydroxyl) indicating that TAM - induced hemolysis is not related to oxidative membrane damage.

This was further evidenced by absence of oxygen consumption and hemoglobin oxidation both determined in parallel with TAM - induced hemolysis.

Furthermore, it was observed that TAM inhibits the peroxidation of human erythrocytes induced by AAPH, thus ruling out TAM - induced cell oxidative stress.

Hemolysis caused by TAM was not preceded by the leakage of K ( +) from the cells, also excluding a colloid - osmotic type mechanism of hemolysis, according to the effects on osmotic fragility curves.	"TAM	20	23	Chemical/Drug"	"K	59	60	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""TAM"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""K"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
However, TAM induces release of peripheral proteins of membrane - cytoskeleton and cytosol proteins essentially bound to band 3.	"TAM	9	12	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""TAM"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Either alpha - T or alpha - TAc increases membrane packing and prevents TAM partition into model membranes.

These effects suggest that the protection from hemolysis by tocopherols is related to a decreased TAM incorporation in condensed membranes and the structural damage of the erythrocyte membrane is consequently avoided.	"tocopherols	60	71	Chemical/Drug"	"TAM	98	101	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""tocopherols"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""TAM"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Therefore, TAM - induced hemolysis results from a structural perturbation of red cell membrane, leading to changes in the framework of the erythrocyte membrane and its cytoskeleton caused by its high partition in the membrane.	"TAM	11	14	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""TAM"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Additionally, since membrane leakage is a final stage of cytotoxicity, the disruption of the structural characteristics of biomembranes by TAM may contribute to the multiple mechanisms of its anticancer action.

It has been shown that bromocriptine - induced tachycardia, which persisted after adrenalectomy, is ( i) mediated by central dopamine D2 receptor activation and ( ii) reduced by 5 - day isoproterenol pretreatment, supporting therefore the hypothesis that this effect is dependent on sympathetic outflow to the heart.

Given that sympathetic neural dominance exhibits a similar developmental pattern, and given that clonidine induces sympathetic withdrawal and bradycardia, we hypothesized that clonidine ' s developmental effects on cardiac rate and ultrasound production would mirror each other.

The epidemiological studies that assessed the risk of venous thromboembolism ( VTE) associated with newer oral contraceptives ( OC) did not distinguish between patterns of OC use, namely first - time users, repeaters and switchers.

Data from a Transnational case - control study were used to assess the risk of VTE for the latter patterns of use, while accounting for duration of use.	[]
Over the period 1993 - 1996, 551 cases of VTE were identified in Germany and the UK along with 2066 controls.	[]
Totals of 128 cases and 650 controls were analysed for repeat use and 135 cases and 622 controls for switching patterns.	[]
The adjusted rate ratio of VTE for repeat users of third generation OC was 0. 6 ( 95% CI: 0. 3 - 1. 2) relative to repeat users of second generation pills, whereas it was 1. 3 ( 95% CI: 0. 7 - 2. 4) for switchers from second to third generation pills relative to switchers from third to second generation pills.	"OC	68	70	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""OC"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We conclude that second and third generation agents are associated with equivalent risks of VTE when the same agent is used repeatedly after interruption periods or when users are switched between the two generations of pills.	[]
These analyses suggest that the higher risk observed for the newer OC in other studies may be the result of inadequate comparisons of pill users with different patterns of pill use.	"OC	67	69	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""OC"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Intracranial aneurysms and cocaine abuse: analysis of prognostic indicators.	[]
OBJECTIVE: The outcome of subarachnoid hemorrhage associated with cocaine abuse is reportedly poor.	[]
However, no study in the literature has reported the use of a statistical model to analyze the variables that influence outcome.	[]
METHODS: A review of admissions during a 6 - year period revealed 14 patients with cocaine - related aneurysms.	"cocaine	83	90	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cocaine"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Intravenous Nimodipine West European Stroke Trial ( INWEST) found a correlation between nimodipine - induced reduction in blood pressure ( BP) and an unfavorable outcome in acute stroke.

We sought to confirm this correlation with and without adjustment for prognostic variables and to investigate outcome in subgroups with increasing levels of BP reduction.	[]
METHODS: Patients with a clinical diagnosis of ischemic stroke ( within 24 hours) were consecutively allocated to receive placebo ( n = 100), 1 mg / h ( low - dose) nimodipine ( n = 101), or 2 mg / h ( high - dose) nimodipine ( n = 94).

The correlation between average BP change during the first 2 days and the outcome at day 21 was analyzed.	[]
RESULTS: Two hundred sixty - five patients were included in this analysis ( n = 92, 93, and 80 for placebo, low dose, and high dose, respectively).	[]
Nimodipine treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction in systolic BP ( SBP) and diastolic BP ( DBP) from baseline compared with placebo during the first few days.

In multivariate analysis, a significant correlation between DBP reduction and worsening of the neurological score was found for the high - dose group ( beta = 0. 49, P = 0. 048).	[]
Patients with a DBP reduction of > or = 20% in the high - dose group had a significantly increased adjusted OR for the compound outcome variable death or dependency ( Barthel Index < 60) ( n / N = 25 / 26, OR 10. 16, 95% CI 1. 02 to 101. 74) and death alone ( n / N = 9 / 26, OR 4. 336, 95% CI 1. 131 16. 619) compared with all placebo patients ( n / N = 62 / 92 and 14 / 92, respectively).	[]
There was no correlation between SBP change and outcome.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: DBP, but not SBP, reduction was associated with neurological worsening after the intravenous administration of high - dose nimodipine after acute stroke.

"Ketamine hydrochloride	0	22	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Ketamine hydrochloride"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
A board - certified emergency physician skilled in airway management supervised administration of the anesthetic, and the patients were monitored by a registered nurse.	[]
Any pain during the reduction was rated by the orthopaedic surgeon treating the patient according to the Children ' s Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale ( CHEOPS).	[]
RESULTS: The average time from intravenous administration of ketamine to manipulation of the fracture or dislocation was one minute and thirty - six seconds ( range, twenty seconds to five minutes), and the average time from intramuscular administration to manipulation was four minutes and forty - two seconds ( range, sixty seconds to fifteen minutes).

The average score according to the Children ' s Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale was 6. 4 points ( range, 5 to 10 points), reflecting minimal or no pain during fracture reduction.	[]
Adequate fracture reduction was obtained in 111 of the children.	[]
Ninety - nine percent ( sixty - eight) of the sixty - nine parents present during the reduction were pleased with the sedation and would allow it to be used again in a similar situation.	[]
Patency of the airway and independent respiration were maintained in all of the patients.	[]
Blood pressure and heart rate remained stable.	[]
Minor side effects included nausea ( thirteen patients), emesis ( eight of the thirteen patients with nausea), clumsiness ( evident as ataxic movements in ten patients), and dysphoric reaction ( one patient).	[]
No long - term sequelae were noted, and no patients had hallucinations or nightmares.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine reliably, safely, and quickly provided adequate sedation to effectively facilitate the reduction of children ' s fractures in the emergency department at our institution.

Serologic testing and immunologic studies were done, and a pericardial biopsy was performed.	[]
RESULTS: A 25 - year - old woman with Graves ' disease had a febrile illness and evidence of pericarditis, which was confirmed by biopsy.	[]
Serologic evaluation revealed the presence of perinuclear - staining antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies ( pANCA) against myeloperoxidase ( MPO).	[]
Propylthiouracil therapy was withdrawn, and she was treated with a 1 - month course of prednisone, which alleviated her symptoms.

Calcineurin - inhibitor induced pain syndrome ( CIPS): a severe disabling complication after organ transplantation.	[]
Bone pain after transplantation is a frequent complication that can be caused by several diseases.	[]
Treatment strategies depend on the correct diagnosis of the pain.	[]
Nine patients with severe pain in their feet, which was registered after transplantation, were investigated.	[]
Bone scans showed an increased tracer uptake of the foot bones.	[]
Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated bone marrow oedema in the painful bones.	[]
Pain was not explained by other diseases causing foot pain, like reflex sympathetic dystrophy, polyneuropathy, Morton ' s neuralgia, gout, osteoporosis, avascular necrosis, intermittent claudication, orthopaedic foot deformities, stress fractures, and hyperparathyroidism.	[]
The reduction of cyclosporine - or tacrolimus trough levels and the administration of calcium channel blockers led to relief of pain.

Cardiac functions were evaluated with radionuclide angiography before chemotherapies.	[]
The plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide ( ANP) and BNP were measured at the time of radionuclide angiography.	[]
Three patients developed congestive heart failure after the completion of chemotherapy.	[]
Five patients were diagnosed as having subclinical heart failure after the completion of chemotherapy.	[]
The plasma levels of BNP in all the patients with clinical and subclinical heart failure increased above the normal limit ( 40 pg / ml) before the detection of clinical or subclinical heart failure by radionuclide angiography.	[]
On the other hand, BNP did not increase in the patients without heart failure given DNR, even at more than 700 mg / m ( 2).	"DNR	84	87	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""DNR"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Parameters of study included analysis of serum chemistry ( ALT, BUN and CPK), and orderly fragmentation of genomic DNA ( both endonuclease - dependent and independent) in addition to microscopic evaluation of damage and / or protection in corresponding PAS stained tissues.	[]
Results indicate that GSPE preexposure prior to AAP, AMI and DOX, provided near complete protection in terms of serum chemistry changes ( ALT, BUN and CPK), and significantly reduced DNA fragmentation.

Additionally, histopathological alterations mirrored both serum chemistry changes and the pattern of DNA fragmentation.	[]
Interestingly, all the drugs, such as, AAP, AMI and DOX induced apoptotic death in addition to necrosis in the respective organs which was very effectively blocked by GSPE.

Since AAP, AMI and DOX undergo biotransformation and are known to produce damaging radicals in vivo, the protection by GSPE may be linked to both inhibition of metabolism and / or detoxification of cytotoxic radicals.

"antidepressants	80	95	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""antidepressants"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METHOD: The response of 44 patients meeting DSM - IV criteria for bipolar disorder to naturalistic treatment was assessed for at least 6 weeks using the Montgomery - Asberg Depression Rating Scale and the Bech - Rafaelson Mania Rating Scale.	[]
Patients who experienced a manic or hypomanic switch were compared with those who did not on several variables including age, sex, diagnosis ( DSM - IV bipolar I vs. bipolar II), number of previous manic episodes, type of antidepressant therapy used ( electroconvulsive therapy vs. antidepressant drugs and, more particularly, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [ SSRIs]), use and type of mood stabilizers ( lithium vs. anticonvulsants), and temperament of the patient, assessed during a normothymic period using the hyperthymia component of the Semi - structured Affective Temperament Interview.

RESULTS: Switches to hypomania or mania occurred in 27% of all patients ( N = 12) ( and in 24% of the subgroup of patients treated with SSRIs [ 8 / 33]); 16% ( N = 7) experienced manic episodes, and 11% ( N = 5) experienced hypomanic episodes.

Sex, age, diagnosis ( bipolar I vs. bipolar II), and additional treatment did not affect the risk of switching.	[]
The incidence of mood switches seemed not to differ between patients receiving an anticonvulsant and those receiving no mood stabilizer.	[]
In contrast, mood switches were less frequent in patients receiving lithium ( 15%, 4 / 26) than in patients not treated with lithium ( 44%, 8 / 18; p =. 04).

The number of previous manic episodes did not affect the probability of switching, whereas a high score on the hyperthymia component of the Semistructured Affective Temperament Interview was associated with a greater risk of switching ( p =. 008).	[]
CONCLUSION: The frequency of mood switching associated with acute antidepressant therapy may be reduced by lithium treatment.

Particular attention should be paid to patients with a hyperthymic temperament, who have a greater risk of mood switches.	[]
Peritubular capillary basement membrane reduplication in allografts and native kidney disease: a clinicopathologic study of 278 consecutive renal specimens.	[]
BACKGROUND: An association has been found between transplant glomerulopathy ( TG) and reduplication of peritubular capillary basement membranes ( PTCR).	[]
Although such an association is of practical and theoretical importance, only one prospective study has tried to confirm it.	[]
METHODS: We examined 278 consecutive renal specimens ( from 135 transplants and 143 native kidneys) for ultrastructural evidence of PTCR.	[]
"In addition to renal allografts with TG, we also examined grafts with acute rejection, recurrent glomerulonephritis, chronic allograft nephropathy and stable grafts ( "" protocol biopsies "")."	[]
Native kidney specimens included a wide range of glomerulopathies as well as cases of thrombotic microangiopathy, malignant hypertension, acute interstitial nephritis, and acute tubular necrosis.	[]
RESULTS: We found PTCR in 14 of 15 cases of TG, in 7 transplant biopsy specimens without TG, and in 13 of 143 native kidney biopsy specimens.	[]
These 13 included cases of malignant hypertension, thrombotic microangiopathy, lupus nephritis, Henoch - Schonlein nephritis, crescentic glomerulonephritis, and cocaine - related acute renal failure.	"cocaine	161	168	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cocaine"", ""start_span"": 161, ""end_span"": 168, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Mild PTCR in allografts without TG did not predict renal failure or significant proteinuria after follow - up periods of between 3 months and 1 year.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that in transplants, there is a strong association between well - developed PTCR and TG, while the significance of mild PTCR and its predictive value in the absence of TG is unclear.	[]
PTCR also occurs in certain native kidney diseases, though the association is not as strong as that for TG.	[]
We suggest that repeated endothelial injury, including immunologic injury, may be the cause of this lesion both in allografts and native kidneys.	[]

Torsades de pointes ( TDP) is a potentially fatal ventricular tachycardia associated with increases in QT interval and monophasic action potential duration ( MAPD).	[]
TDP is a side - effect that has led to withdrawal of several drugs from the market ( e. g. terfenadine and terodiline).

2.	[]
The potential of compounds to cause TDP was evaluated by monitoring their effects on MAPD in dog.	[]
Four compounds known to increase QT interval and cause TDP were investigated: terfenadine, terodiline, cisapride and E4031.

On the basis that only free drug in the systemic circulation will elicit a pharmacological response target, free concentrations in plasma were selected to mimic the free drug exposures in man.	[]
Infusion regimens were designed that rapidly achieved and maintained target - free concentrations of these drugs in plasma and data on the relationship between free concentration and changes in MAPD were obtained for these compounds.	[]

These data indicate that the free ED50 in plasma for terfenadine ( 1. 9 nM), terodiline ( 76 nM), cisapride ( 11 nM) and E4031 ( 1. 9 nM) closely correlate with the free concentration in man causing QT effects.

An analysis for factor V Leiden and the G20210A mutation in the prothrombin gene was conducted in 217 patients and 763 controls RESULTS: The odds ratio for myocardial infarction among women who used any type of combined oral contraceptive, as compared with nonusers, was 2. 0 ( 95 percent confidence interval, 1. 5 to 2. 8).	"oral contraceptive	220	238	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""oral contraceptive"", ""start_span"": 220, ""end_span"": 238, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The adjusted odds ratio was 2. 5 ( 95 percent confidence interval, 1. 5 to 4. 1) among women who used second - generation oral contraceptives and 1. 3 ( 95 percent confidence interval, 0. 7 to 2. 5) among those who used third - generation oral contraceptives.

Their use in orthotopic liver transplantation ( OLTX) has dramatically improved success rates.	[]
Recently, however, we have had an increase of patients who are presenting after OLTX with end - stage renal disease ( ESRD).	[]
This retrospective study examines the incidence and treatment of ESRD and chronic renal failure ( CRF) in OLTX patients.	[]
METHODS: Patients receiving an OLTX only from June 1985 through December of 1994 who survived 6 months postoperatively were studied ( n = 834).	[]
Our prospectively collected database was the source of information.	[]
Patients were divided into three groups: Controls, no CRF or ESRD, n = 748; CRF, sustained serum creatinine > 2. 5 mg / dl, n = 41; and ESRD, n = 45.	"creatinine	97	107	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""creatinine"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Groups were compared for preoperative laboratory variables, diagnosis, postoperative variables, survival, type of ESRD therapy, and survival from onset of ESRD.	[]
RESULTS: At 13 years after OLTX, the incidence of severe renal dysfunction was 18. 1% ( CRF 8. 6% and ESRD 9. 5%).	[]
Compared with control patients, CRF and ESRD patients had higher preoperative serum creatinine levels, a greater percentage of patients with hepatorenal syndrome, higher percentage requirement for dialysis in the first 3 months postoperatively, and a higher 1 - year serum creatinine.	"creatinine	84	94	Chemical/Drug"	"creatinine	84	94	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""creatinine"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""creatinine"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis using preoperative and postoperative variables identified that an increase of serum creatinine compared with average at 1 year, 3 months, and 4 weeks postoperatively were independent risk factors for the development of CRF or ESRD with odds ratios of 2. 6, 2. 2, and 1. 6, respectively.	"creatinine	135	145	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""creatinine"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Overall survival from the time of OLTX was not significantly different among groups, but by year 13, the survival of the patients who had ESRD was only 28. 2% compared with 54. 6% in the control group.	[]
Patients developing ESRD had a 6 - year survival after onset of ESRD of 27% for the patients receiving hemodialysis versus 71. 4% for the patients developing ESRD who subsequently received kidney transplants.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: Patients who are more than 10 years post - OLTX have CRF and ESRD at a high rate.	[]
The development of ESRD decreases survival, particularly in those patients treated with dialysis only.	[]
Patients who develop ESRD have a higher preoperative and 1 - year serum creatinine and are more likely to have hepatorenal syndrome.	"creatinine	72	82	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""creatinine"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
However, an increase of serum creatinine at various times postoperatively is more predictive of the development of CRF or ESRD.	"creatinine	30	40	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""creatinine"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Epileptic seizures following cortical application of fibrin sealants containing tranexamic acid in rats.	"tranexamic acid	80	95	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""tranexamic acid"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
BACKGROUND: Fibrin sealants ( FS) derived from human plasma are frequently used in neurosurgery.	[]
In order to increase clot stability, FS typically contain aprotinin, a natural fibrinolysis inhibitor.	[]
Recently, synthetic fibrinolysis inhibitors such as tranexamic acid ( tAMCA) have been considered as substitutes for aprotinin.	"tranexamic acid	52	67	Chemical/Drug"	"tAMCA	70	75	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""tranexamic acid"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""tAMCA"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
However, tAMCA has been shown to cause epileptic seizures.	"tAMCA	9	14	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""tAMCA"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We wanted to study whether tAMCA retains its convulsive action if incorporated into a FS.	"tAMCA	27	32	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""tAMCA"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METHOD: FS containing aprotinin or different concentrations of tAMCA ( 0. 5 - 47. 5 mg / ml) were applied to the pial surface of the cortex of anaesthetized rats.	"tAMCA	63	68	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""tAMCA"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The response of the animals was evaluated using electroencephalography and by monitoring the clinical behaviour during and after recovery from anaesthesia.	[]
FINDINGS: FS containing tAMCA caused paroxysmal brain activity which was associated with distinct convulsive behaviours.	"tAMCA	24	29	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""tAMCA"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The degree of these seizures increased with increasing concentration of tAMCA.	"tAMCA	72	77	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""tAMCA"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Thus, FS containing 47. 5 mg / ml tAMCA evoked generalized seizures in all tested rats ( n = 6) while the lowest concentration of tAMCA ( 0. 5 mg / ml) only evoked brief episodes of jerk - correlated convulsive potentials in 1 of 6 rats.	"tAMCA	34	39	Chemical/Drug"	"tAMCA	34	39	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""tAMCA"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""tAMCA"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In contrast, FS containing aprotinin did not evoke any paroxysmal activity.	[]
INTERPRETATION: Tranexamic acid retains its convulsive action within FS.	"Tranexamic acid	16	31	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Tranexamic acid"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Thus, use of FS containing tAMCA for surgery within or close to the CNS may pose a substantial risk to the patient.	"tAMCA	27	32	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""tAMCA"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Sequential observations of exencephaly and subsequent morphological changes by mouse exo utero development system: analysis of the mechanism of transformation from exencephaly to anencephaly.	[]
Anencephaly has been suggested to develop from exencephaly; however, there is little direct experimental evidence to support this, and the mechanism of transformation remains unclear.	[]
We examined this theory using the exo utero development system that allows direct and sequential observations of mid - to late - gestation mouse embryos.	[]
We observed the exencephaly induced by 5 - azacytidine at embryonic day 13. 5 ( E13. 5), let the embryos develop exo utero until E18. 5, and re - observed the same embryos at E18. 5.	"5 - azacytidine	39	54	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""5 - azacytidine"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We confirmed several cases of transformation from exencephaly to anencephaly.	[]
However, in many cases, the exencephalic brain tissue was preserved with more or less reduction during this period.	[]
To analyze the transformation patterns, we classified the exencephaly by size and shape of the exencephalic tissue into several types at E13. 5 and E18. 5.	[]
It was found that the transformation of exencephalic tissue was not simply size - dependent, and all cases of anencephaly at E18. 5 resulted from embryos with a large amount of exencephalic tissue at E13. 5.	[]
Microscopic observation showed the configuration of exencephaly at E13. 5, frequent hemorrhaging and detachment of the neural plate from surface ectoderm in the exencephalic head at E15. 5, and multiple modes of reduction in the exencephalic tissue at E18. 5.	[]
From observations of the vasculature, altered distribution patterns of vessels were identified in the exencephalic head.	[]
These findings suggest that overgrowth of the exencephalic neural tissue causes the altered distribution patterns of vessels, subsequent peripheral circulatory failure and / or hemorrhaging in various parts of the exencephalic head, leading to the multiple modes of tissue reduction during transformation from exencephaly to anencephaly.

ROIs drawn over the gamma camera images showed a ratio of 4. 4.	[]
The high image quality suggests that high contrast images can be obtained in humans and the 96 h stability makes it an ideal agent to detect, in patients, early cardiac infarction.	[]

Tissues were analyzed at 0, 5, 7, 11, 21, 45, 80 and 126 days after PAN injection so as to include both the acute phase of proteinuria associated with foot process effacement ( days 5 - 11) and the chronic phase of proteinuria associated with glomerulosclerosis ( days 45 - 126).

At day 5, GLEPP1 protein and mRNA were reduced from the normal range ( 265. 2 + / - 79. 6 x 10 ( 6) moles / glomerulus and 100%) to 15% of normal ( 41. 8 + / - 4. 8 x 10 ( 6) moles / glomerulus, p < 0. 005).	[]
This occurred in association with an increase in urinary protein content from 1. 8 + / - 1 to 99. 0 + / - 61 mg / day ( p < 0. 001).	[]
In contrast, podocalyxin did not change significantly at this time.	[]
By day 11, GLEPP1 protein and mRNA had begun to return towards baseline.	[]
By day 45 - 126, at a time when glomerular scarring was present, GLEPP1 was absent from glomerulosclerotic areas although the total glomerular content of GLEPP1 was not different from normal.	[]
We conclude that GLEPP1 expression, unlike podocalyxin, reflects podocyte injury induced by PAN.	"PAN	92	95	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""PAN"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

BACKGROUND: The septo - hippocampal cholinergic pathway has been implicated in epileptogenesis, and genetic factors influence the response to cholinergic agents, but limited data are available on cholinergic involvement in alcohol withdrawal severity.	"alcohol	223	230	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""alcohol"", ""start_span"": 223, ""end_span"": 230, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Thus, the relationship between cholinergic activity and responsiveness and alcohol withdrawal was investigated in a genetic animal model of ethanol withdrawal severity.

RESULTS: Sensitivity to several convulsion endpoints induced by nicotine, carbachol, and neostigmine were significantly greater in WSR versus WSP mice.

In microdialysis experiments, the lines did not differ in basal release of ACh, and 50 mM KCl increased ACh output in both lines of mice.

However, the increase in release of ACh produced by the first application of KCl was 2 - fold higher in WSP versus WSR mice.

CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that differences in cholinergic activity and postsynaptic sensitivity to cholinergic convulsants may be associated with ethanol withdrawal severity and implicate cholinergic mechanisms in alcohol withdrawal.

Specifically, WSP mice may have lower sensitivity to cholinergic convulsants compared with WSR because of postsynaptic receptor desensitization brought on by higher activity of cholinergic neurons.	[]
Capsaicin - induced muscle pain alters the excitability of the human jaw - stretch reflex.	"Capsaicin	0	9	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Capsaicin"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The pathophysiology of painful temporomandibular disorders is not fully understood, but evidence suggests that muscle pain modulates motor function in characteristic ways.	[]
This study tested the hypothesis that activation of nociceptive muscle afferent fibers would be linked to an increased excitability of the human jaw - stretch reflex and whether this process would be sensitive to length and velocity of the stretch.	[]
Capsaicin ( 10 micro g) was injected into the masseter muscle to induce pain in 11 healthy volunteers.	"Capsaicin	0	9	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Capsaicin"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Short - latency reflex responses were evoked in the masseter and temporalis muscles by a stretch device with different velocities and displacements before, during, and after the pain.	[]
The normalized reflex amplitude increased with an increase in velocity at a given displacement, but remained constant with different displacements at a given velocity.	[]
The normalized reflex amplitude was significantly higher during pain, but only at faster stretches in the painful muscle.	[]
Increased sensitivity of the fusimotor system during acute muscle pain could be one likely mechanism to explain the findings.	[]

When injected into the accumbens shell ( but not the core) before cocaine, CP 93129 ( 0. 1 - 10 microg / side) enhanced the locomotor response to cocaine; the maximum effect being observed after 10 microg / side of the agonist.

Our findings indicate that cocaine induced hyperlocomotion is modified by 5 - HT1B receptor ligands microinjected into the accumbens shell, but not core, this modification consisting in inhibitory and facilitatory effects of the 5 - HT1B receptor antagonist ( GR 55562) and agonist ( CP 93129), respectively.

Severe ocular and orbital toxicity after intracarotid injection of carboplatin for recurrent glioblastomas.	"carboplatin	67	78	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""carboplatin"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma is a malignant tumor that occurs in the cerebrum during adulthood.	[]
With current treatment regimens including combined surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, the average life expectancy of the patients is limited to approximately 1 year.	[]
Therefore, patients with glioblastoma sometimes have intracarotid injection of carcinostatics added to the treatment regimen.	[]
Generally, carboplatin is said to have milder side effects than cisplatin, whose ocular and orbital toxicity are well known.	"carboplatin	11	22	Chemical/Drug"	"cisplatin	64	73	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""carboplatin"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""cisplatin"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
However, we experienced a case of severe ocular and orbital toxicity after intracarotid injection of carboplatin, which is infrequently reported.	"carboplatin	101	112	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""carboplatin"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
CASE: A 58 - year - old man received an intracarotid injection of carboplatin for recurrent glioblastomas in his left temporal lobe.	"carboplatin	66	77	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""carboplatin"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
He complained of pain and visual disturbance in the ipsilateral eye 30 h after the injection.	[]
Various ocular symptoms and findings caused by carboplatin toxicity were seen.	"carboplatin	47	58	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""carboplatin"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
RESULTS: He was treated with intravenous administration of corticosteroids and glycerin for 6 days after the injection.	"glycerin	79	87	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""glycerin"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Although the intraocular pressure elevation caused by secondary acute angle - closure glaucoma decreased and ocular pain diminished, inexorable papilledema and exudative retinal detachment continued for 3 weeks.	[]
Finally, 6 weeks later, diffuse chorioretinal atrophy with optic atrophy occurred and the vision in his left eye was lost.	[]
CONCLUSION: When performing intracarotid injection of carboplatin, we must be aware of its potentially blinding ocular toxicity.	"carboplatin	54	65	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""carboplatin"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
It is recommended that further studies and investigations are undertaken in the effort to minimize such severe side effects.	[]
Visual hallucinations associated with zonisamide.	"zonisamide	38	48	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""zonisamide"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Zonisamide is a broad - spectrum antiepileptic drug used to treat various types of seizures.	"Zonisamide	0	10	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Zonisamide"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Although visual hallucinations have not been reported as an adverse effect of this agent, we describe three patients who experienced complex visual hallucinations and altered mental status after zonisamide treatment was begun or its dosage increased.	"zonisamide	195	205	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""zonisamide"", ""start_span"": 195, ""end_span"": 205, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
All three had been diagnosed earlier with epilepsy, and their electroencephalogram ( EEG) findings were abnormal.	[]
During monitoring, visual hallucinations did not correlate with EEG readings, nor did video recording capture any of the described events.	[]
None of the patients had experienced visual hallucinations before this event.	[]
The only recent change in their treatment was the introduction or increased dosage of zonisamide.	"zonisamide	86	96	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""zonisamide"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
With either discontinuation or decreased dosage of the drug the symptoms disappeared and did not recur.	[]
Further observations and reports will help clarify this adverse effect.	[]
Until then, clinicians need to be aware of this possible complication associated with zonisamide.	"zonisamide	86	96	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""zonisamide"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Anti - epileptic drugs - induced de novo absence seizures.	[]
The authors present three patients with de novo absence epilepsy after administration of carbamazepine and vigabatrin.	"carbamazepine	89	102	Chemical/Drug"	"vigabatrin	107	117	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""carbamazepine"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""vigabatrin"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Despite the underlying diseases, the prognosis for drug - induced de novo absence seizure is good because it subsides rapidly after discontinuing the use of the offending drugs.	[]
The gamma - aminobutyric acid - transmitted thalamocortical circuitry accounts for a major part of the underlying neurophysiology of the absence epilepsy.	"gamma - aminobutyric acid	4	29	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""gamma - aminobutyric acid"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Because drug - induced de novo absence seizure is rare, pro - absence drugs can only be considered a promoting factor.	[]
The underlying epileptogenecity of the patients or the synergistic effects of the accompanying drugs is required to trigger the de novo absence seizure.	[]
The possibility of drug - induced aggravation should be considered whenever an unexpected increase in seizure frequency and / or new seizure types appear following a change in drug treatment.	[]
By understanding the underlying mechanism of absence epilepsy, we can avoid the inappropriate use of anticonvulsants in children with epilepsy and prevent drug - induced absence seizures.	[]
Prenatal dexamethasone programs hypertension and renal injury in the rat.	"dexamethasone	9	22	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dexamethasone"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Dexamethasone is frequently administered to the developing fetus to accelerate pulmonary development.	[]

Offspring of rats administered dexamethasone on days 15 and 16 gestation had a 20% reduction in glomerular number compared with control at 6 to 9 months of age ( 22 527 + / - 509 versus 28 050 + / - 561, P < 0. 05), which was comparable to the percent reduction in glomeruli measured at 3 weeks of age.	"dexamethasone	31	44	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dexamethasone"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Six - to 9 - month old rats receiving prenatal dexamethasone on days 17 and 18 of gestation had a 17% reduction in glomeruli ( 23 380 + / - 587) compared with control rats ( P < 0. 05).	"dexamethasone	47	60	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dexamethasone"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Male rats that received prenatal dexamethasone on days 15 and 16, 17 and 18, and 13 and 14 of gestation had elevated blood pressures at 6 months of age; the latter group did not have a reduction in glomerular number.	"dexamethasone	33	46	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dexamethasone"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Adult rats given dexamethasone on days 15 and 16 of gestation had more glomeruli with glomerulosclerosis than control rats.	"dexamethasone	17	30	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dexamethasone"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
This study shows that prenatal dexamethasone in rats results in a reduction in glomerular number, glomerulosclerosis, and hypertension when administered at specific points during gestation.	"dexamethasone	31	44	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dexamethasone"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Hypertension was observed in animals that had a reduction in glomeruli as well as in a group that did not have a reduction in glomerular number, suggesting that a reduction in glomerular number is not the sole cause for the development of hypertension.	[]

In the ' conscious catheterized rat ' model, the glomerular filtration rate ( GFR) was measured as the clearance of Cr ( EDTA).	[]
The morphological analysis of the kidneys included a semi - quantitative scoring system analysing the degree of striped fibrosis, subcapsular fibrosis and the number of basophilic tubules, plus an additional stereological analysis of the total grade of fibrosis in the cortex stained with Sirius Red.

In 7 of the 18 rats, degeneration and myocyte vacuolisation were found.	[]
Only five of the controls exhibited evidence of very slight perivascular fibrosis.	[]
A significant rise in cTnT was found in DOX rats after cumulative doses of 7. 5 and 12 mg / kg in comparison with baseline ( p < 0. 05).	"DOX	40	43	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""DOX"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

All markers remained stable in controls.	[]
Analysis of data revealed a significant correlation between maximal cTnT and ED and ES LV diameters / BW ( r = 0. 81 and 0. 65; p < 0. 0001).	[]
A significant relationship was observed between maximal cTnT and the extent of myocardial morphological changes, and between LV diameters / BW and histological findings.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: Among markers of ischemic injury after DOX in rats, cTnT showed the greatest ability to detect myocardial damage assessed by echocardiographic detection and histological changes.

Although there was a discrepancy between the amount of cTnI and cTnT after DOX, probably due to heterogeneity in cross - reactivities of mAbs to various cTnI and cTnT forms, it is likely that cTnT in rats after DOX indicates cell damage determined by the magnitude of injury induced and that cTnT should be a useful marker for the prediction of experimentally induced cardiotoxicity and possibly for cardioprotective experiments.

BACKGROUND: Cyproterone acetate combined with ethinyl estradiol ( CPA / EE) is licensed in the UK for the treatment of women with acne and hirsutism and is also a treatment option for polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS).	"Cyproterone acetate	12	31	Chemical/Drug"	"ethinyl estradiol	46	63	Chemical/Drug"	"CPA	66	69	Chemical/Drug"	"EE	72	74	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Cyproterone acetate"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""ethinyl estradiol"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""CPA"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""EE"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Previous studies have demonstrated an increased risk of venous thromboembolism ( VTE) associated with CPA / EE compared with conventional combined oral contraceptives ( COCs).	"CPA	102	105	Chemical/Drug"	"EE	108	110	Chemical/Drug"	"oral contraceptives	147	166	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""CPA"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""EE"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""oral contraceptives"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 166, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We believe the results of those studies may have been affected by residual confounding.	[]
METHODS: Using the General Practice Research Database we conducted a cohort analysis and case - control study nested within a population of women aged between 15 and 39 years with acne, hirsutism or PCOS to estimate the risk of VTE associated with CPA / EE.	"CPA	248	251	Chemical/Drug"	"EE	254	256	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""CPA"", ""start_span"": 248, ""end_span"": 251, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""EE"", ""start_span"": 254, ""end_span"": 256, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
RESULTS: The age - adjusted incidence rate ratio for CPA / EE versus conventional COCs was 2. 20 [ 95% confidence interval ( CI) 1. 35 - 3. 58].	"CPA	53	56	Chemical/Drug"	"EE	59	61	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""CPA"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""EE"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Using as the reference group women who were not using oral contraception, had no recent pregnancy or menopausal symptoms, the case - control analysis gave an adjusted odds ratio ( OR ( adj)) of 7. 44 ( 95% CI 3. 67 - 15. 08) for CPA / EE use compared with an OR ( adj) of 2. 58 ( 95% CI 1. 60 - 4. 18) for use of conventional COCs.

Nephrotoxicity was assessed by measuring the concentrations of creatinine and urea in the plasma and reduced glutathione ( GSH) in the kidney cortex, and by light microscopic examination of kidney sections.

The results indicated that concomitant treatment with gum Arabic and GM significantly increased creatinine and urea by about 183 and 239%, respectively ( compared to 432 and 346%, respectively, in rats treated with cellulose and GM), and decreased that of cortical GSH by 21% ( compared to 27% in the cellulose plus GM group) The GM - induced proximal tubular necrosis appeared to be slightly less severe in rats given GM together with gum Arabic than in those given GM and cellulose.

The relative amounts of alphaENaC, betaENaC and gammaENaC mRNAs were determined in kidneys from these rats by real - time quantitative TaqMan PCR, and the amounts of proteins by Western blot.	[]
The kinetics of urinary sodium excretion and the appearance of proteinuria were comparable with those reported previously.	"sodium	24	30	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sodium"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Sodium retention occurred on days 2, 3 and 6 after PAN injection.

A significant up - regulation of alphaENaC and betaENaC mRNA abundance on days 1 and 2 preceded sodium retention on days 2 and 3.	"sodium	96	102	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sodium"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Conversely, down - regulation of alphaENaC, betaENaC and gammaENaC mRNA expression on day 3 occurred in the presence of high aldosterone concentrations, and was followed by a return of sodium excretion to control values.	"aldosterone	125	136	Chemical/Drug"	"sodium	185	191	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""aldosterone"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""sodium"", ""start_span"": 185, ""end_span"": 191, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The amounts of alphaENaC, betaENaC and gammaENaC proteins were not increased during PAN - induced sodium retention.

METHODS: Using in vivo microdialysis, we compared acute exposure ( 450 mg / kg) to an identical sub - chronic exposure ( 150 mg / kg per day for 3 days), followed by 1 - or 3 - day washout.	[]
Finally, we examined the low dose of 150 mg / kg ( 50 mg / kg per day) using a similar washout period.	[]
RESULTS: Sub - chronic GVG exposure inhibited the effect of cocaine for 3 days, which exceeded in magnitude and duration the identical acute dose.

Amount of bleeding and hematoma size in the collagenase - induced intracerebral hemorrhage rat model.	[]
The aggravated risk on intracerebral hemorrhage ( ICH) with drugs used for stroke patients should be estimated carefully.	[]
We therefore established sensitive quantification methods and provided a rat ICH model for detection of ICH deterioration.	[]
In ICH intrastriatally induced by 0. 014 - unit, 0. 070 - unit, and 0. 350 - unit collagenase, the amount of bleeding was measured using a hemoglobin assay developed in the present study and was compared with the morphologically determined hematoma volume.	[]
The blood amounts and hematoma volumes were significantly correlated, and the hematoma induced by 0. 014 - unit collagenase was adequate to detect ICH deterioration.	[]
In ICH induction using 0. 014 - unit collagenase, heparin enhanced the hematoma volume 3. 4 - fold over that seen in control ICH animals and the bleeding 7. 6 - fold.	"heparin	50	57	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""heparin"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty - two patients with biopsy - proven prostatic adenocarcinoma [ 26 with stage C ( T3N0M0) and 16 with stage D1 ( T3N1M0)] were included in this study.	[]
All patients received CAB [ leuprolide acetate ( LHRH - A) 3. 75 mg, intramuscularly, every 28 days plus 250 mg flutamide, tid, per Os] and were evaluated for anemia by physical examination and laboratory tests at baseline and 4 subsequent intervals ( 1, 2, 3 and 6 months post - CAB).

Patients with stage D2 - 3 disease, abnormal hemoglobin level or renal and liver function tests that were higher than the upper limits were excluded from the study.	[]
The duration of the study was six months.	[]
RESULTS: The mean hemoglobin ( Hb) levels were significantly declined in all patients from baseline of 14. 2 g / dl to 14. 0 g / dl, 13. 5 g / dl, 13. 2 g / dl and 12. 7 g / dl at 1, 2, 3 and 6 months post - CAB, respectively.	[]
Severe and clinically evident anemia of Hb < 11 g / dl with clinical symptoms was detected in 6 patients ( 14. 3%).	[]
This CAB - induced anemia was normochromic and normocytic.	[]
At six months post - CAB, patients with severe anemia had a Hb mean value of 10. 2 + / - 0. 1 g / dl ( X + / - SE), whereas the other patients had mild anemia with Hb mean value of 13. 2 + / - 0. 17 ( X + / - SE).	[]
The development of severe anemia at 6 months post - CAB was predictable by the reduction of Hb baseline value of more than 2. 5 g / dl after 3 months of CAB ( p = 0. 01).	[]
The development of severe CAB - induced anemia in prostate cancer patients did not correlate with T baseline values ( T < 3 ng / ml versus T > or = 3 ng / ml), with age ( < 76 yrs versus > or = 76 yrs), and clinical stage ( stage C versus stage D1).	[]
Severe and clinically evident anemia was easily corrected by subcutaneous injections ( 3 times / week for 1 month) of recombinant erythropoietin ( rHuEPO - beta).	[]
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that rHuEPO - beta correctable CAB - induced anemia occurs in 14. 3% of prostate cancer patients after 6 months of therapy.	[]

On the other hand, pretreatment with p - chlorophenylalamine ( 3 X 320 mg / kg i. p., 24 hr), a serotonin depletor, caused no significant change in the hyperactivity.

When comparing all lithium treated versus non - lithium - treated groups, lithium caused a reduction in glomerular filtration rate ( GFR) without significant changes in effective renal plasma flow ( as determined by a marker secreted into the proximal tubules) or lithium clearance.

NX caused an additive deterioration in GFR which, however, was ameliorated by HP.	[]
NX + HP caused a further rise in blood pressure in Li - pretreated rats.	"Li	51	53	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Li"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

In this model of chronic renal failure the decline in GFR is not accompanied by a corresponding fall in effective renal plasma flow, which may be the functional expression of the formation of nonfiltrating atubular glomeruli.	[]

Due to the interdependence of risk factors in clinical populations, it is difficult to independently examine factors that may influence the development of LIDs.	[]
Using macaque monkeys with different types of MPTP - induced parkinsonism, the current study evaluated the degree to which rate of symptom progression, symptom severity, and response to and duration of levodopa therapy may be involved in the development of LIDs.

In contrast, monkeys with long - term MPTP exposure, slow symptom progression and / or long symptom duration prior to initiation of levodopa therapy were more resistant to developing LIDs ( e. g., dyskinesia developed no sooner than 146 days of chronic levodopa administration).

After a 30 - min baseline measure of locomotor activity ( day 0), animals were maintained on a cyclic diet of 12 - h deprivation followed by 12 - h access to 10% sucrose solution and chow pellets ( 12 h access starting 4 h after onset of the dark period) for 21 days.

Noxious chemical stimulation of rat facial mucosa increases intracranial blood flow through a trigemino - parasympathetic reflex - - an experimental model for vascular dysfunctions in cluster headache.	[]
Cluster headache is characterized by typical autonomic dysfunctions including facial and intracranial vascular disturbances.	[]

OBJECTIVE: To assess and characterise the risk of bladder cancer, and its relation to cyclophosphamide, in patients with Wegener ' s granulomatosis.	"cyclophosphamide	86	102	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cyclophosphamide"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METHODS: In the population based, nationwide Swedish Inpatient Register a cohort of 1065 patients with Wegener ' s granulomatosis, 1969 - 95, was identified.	[]
Through linkage with the Swedish Cancer Register, all subjects in this cohort diagnosed with bladder cancer were identified.	[]
Nested within the cohort, a matched case - control study was performed to estimate the association between cyclophosphamide and bladder cancer using odds ratios ( ORs) as relative risk.	"cyclophosphamide	107	123	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cyclophosphamide"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In the cohort the cumulative risk of bladder cancer after Wegener ' s granulomatosis, and the relative prevalence of a history of bladder cancer at the time of diagnosis of Wegener ' s granulomatosis, were also estimated.	[]
RESULTS: The median cumulative doses of cyclophosphamide among cases ( n = 11) and controls ( n = 25) were 113 g and 25 g, respectively.	"cyclophosphamide	40	56	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cyclophosphamide"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The risk of bladder cancer doubled for every 10 g increment in cyclophosphamide ( OR = 2. 0, 95% confidence interval ( CI) 0. 8 to 4. 9).	"cyclophosphamide	63	79	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cyclophosphamide"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Treatment duration longer than 1 year was associated with an eightfold increased risk ( OR = 7. 7, 95% CI 0. 9 to 69).	[]
The absolute risk for bladder cancer in the cohort reached 10% 16 years after diagnosis of Wegener ' s granulomatosis, and a history of bladder cancer was ( non - significantly) twice as common as expected at the time of diagnosis of Wegener ' s granulomatosis.	[]
CONCLUSION: The results indicate a dose - response relationship between cyclophosphamide and the risk of bladder cancer, high cumulative risks in the entire cohort, and also the possibility of risk factors operating even before Wegener ' s granulomatosis.

nAChRs are pentameric ion channels usually composed of alpha and beta subunits.	[]
A gene cluster comprises the alpha3, alpha5 and beta4 subunits, which coassemble to form functional receptors.	[]
We examined the role of the beta4 subunits in nicotine - induced seizures and hypolocomotion in beta4 homozygous null ( beta4 - / -) and alpha3 heterozygous ( + / -) mice.

Using in situ hybridization probes for the alpha3 and alpha5 subunits, we showed that alpha5 mRNA levels are unchanged, whereas alpha3 mRNA levels are selectively decreased in the mitral cell layer of the olfactory bulb, and the inferior and the superior colliculus of beta4 - / - brains.	[]
alpha3 + / - mice were partially resistant to nicotine - induced seizures when compared to wild - type littermates.	"nicotine	46	54	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""nicotine"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
mRNA levels for the alpha5 and the beta4 subunits were unchanged in alpha3 + / - brains.	[]

A new method using a commercially available, pen - shaped laser pointer was developed.	[]
Aim of the study was to determine sensitivity, reproducibility, reference values and the agreement with a questionnaire.	[]
METHODS: Tremor was measured using a laser pointer technique.	[]
To determine sensitivity we assessed tremor in 44 patients with obstructive lung disease after administration of cumulative doses of salbutamol.	"salbutamol	133	143	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""salbutamol"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Subjects were asked to aim at the centre of a target, subdivided in concentric circles, from 5 m distance.	[]
The circle in which the participant succeeded to aim was recorded in millimetres radius.	[]
In another series of measurements, reproducibility and reference values of the tremor was assessed in 65 healthy subjects in three sessions, at 9 a. m., 4 p. m. and 9 a. m., respectively, 1 week later.	[]
Postural tremor was measured with the arm horizontally outstretched rest tremor with the arm supported by an armrest and finally tremor was measured after holding a 2 - kg weight until exhaustion.	[]
Inter - observer variability was measured in a series of 10 healthy subjects.	[]
Tremor was measured simultaneously by two independent observers.	[]
RESULTS: Salbutamol significantly increased tremor severity in patients in a dose - dependent way.	"Salbutamol	9	19	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Salbutamol"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Within healthy adults no age - dependency could be found ( b = 0. 262 mm / year; P = 0. 72).	[]
There was no agreement between the questionnaire and tremor severity ( r = 0. 093; P = 0. 53).	[]
Postural tremor showed no significant difference between the first and third session ( P = 0. 07).	[]
Support of the arm decreased tremor severity, exhaustion increased tremor severity significantly.	[]
A good agreement was found between two independent observers ( interclass correlation coefficient 0. 72).	[]
DISCUSSION: Quantifying tremor by using an inexpensive laser pointer is, with the exception of children ( < 12 years) a sensitive and reproducible method.	[]

Clinical characteristics, medications, and serum chemistries at baseline and follow - up time periods were compared.	[]
RESULTS: Sixty - seven of 926 patients ( 7. 2%) required discontinuation of spironolactone due to hyperkalemia ( n = 33) or renal failure ( n = 34).	"spironolactone	76	90	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""spironolactone"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Patients who developed hyperkalemia were older and more likely to have diabetes, had higher baseline serum potassium levels and lower baseline potassium supplement doses, and were more likely to be treated with beta - blockers than controls ( n = 134).

Clinical and experimental studies also suggest that situations causing gallbladder dysfunction, such as fasting, may have a role for the development of pseudolithiasis.	[]
In this study, we prospectively evaluated the incidence and clinical importance of pseudolithiasis in paediatric surgical patients receiving ceftriaxone treatment, who often had to fast in the post - operative period.	"ceftriaxone	141	152	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ceftriaxone"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Fifty children who were given ceftriaxone were evaluated by serial abdominal sonograms.	"ceftriaxone	30	41	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ceftriaxone"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Of those, 13 ( 26%) developed biliary pathology.	[]
Comparison of the patients with or without pseudolithiasis revealed no significant difference with respect to age, sex, duration of the treatment and starvation variables.	[]
After cessation of the treatment, pseudolithiasis resolved spontaneously within a short period.	[]
The incidence of pseudolithiasis is not affected by fasting.	[]

Formation of coronary aneurysm is a rare complication of stenting with bare metal stents, but based on experimental studies drug - eluting stents may induce toxic effects on the vessel wall with incomplete stent apposition, aneurysm formation and with the potential of stent thrombosis or vessel rupture.	[]
We present a 43 - year - old man who developed a coronary aneurysm in the right coronary artery 6 months after receiving a paclitaxel - eluting stent.	"paclitaxel	123	133	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""paclitaxel"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The patient was asymptomatic and the aneurysm was detected in a routine control.	[]
Angiography and intracoronary ultrasound demonstrated lack of contact between stent and vessel wall in a 15 - mm long segment with maximal aneurysm diameter of 6. 0 mm.	[]
The patient was successfully treated with a graft stent.	[]
Causes of acute thrombotic microangiopathy in patients receiving kidney transplantation.	[]
OBJECTIVES: Thrombotic microangiopathy is a well - known problem in patients following renal transplantation.	[]
In postrenal transplantation, thrombotic microangiopathy is often a reflection of hemolytic uremic syndrome.	[]
We aimed to determine the causes of thrombotic microangiopathy in a population of renal transplantation recipients and discuss the literature.	[]
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the causes of thrombotic microangiopathy during a 1 - year period, from June 2003 to June 2004, at the King Fahad National Guard Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, by reviewing the slides of all transplant biopsies ( n = 25) performed during this interval.	[]
Pre - and posttransplant crossmatching was done when possible.	[]
RESULTS: Five cases of thrombotic microangiopathy were found.	[]
Three of these cases were from the 25 transplantations performed at King Fahad National Guard Hospital, while the other 2 transplantations had been performed abroad and were referred to us for follow - up.	[]
Three cases were related to cyclosporine, and 1 case was secondary to both cyclosporine and tacrolimus.	"cyclosporine	28	40	Chemical/Drug"	"cyclosporine	28	40	Chemical/Drug"	"tacrolimus	92	102	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cyclosporine"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""cyclosporine"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""tacrolimus"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The fifth case had features of thrombotic microangiopathy related to an antiphospholipid syndrome in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: In the literature, the most - frequent cause of hemolytic uremic syndrome in patients following renal transplantation is recurrence of the hemolytic uremic syndrome.	[]
Other causes include drug - related ( cyclosporine, tacrolimus) toxicity, procoagulant status, and antibody - mediated rejection.

BACKGROUND: Cyclooxygenase ( COX) inhibitors are one of the most often ingested drugs during pregnancy.	[]
Unlike general toxicity data, their prenatal toxic effects were not extensively studied before.	[]
The aim of the experiment was to evaluate the developmental toxicity of the non - selective ( piroxicam) and selective ( DFU; 5, 5 - dimethyl - 3 - ( 3 - fluorophenyl) - 4 - ( 4 - methylsulphonyl) phenyl - 2 ( 5H) - furanon) COX - 2 inhibitors.

METHODS: Drugs were separately, orally once daily dosed to pregnant rats from day 8 to 21 ( GD1 = plug day).	[]
Doses were set at 0. 3, 3. 0 and 30. 0mg / kg for piroxicam and 0. 2, 2. 0 and 20. 0mg / kg for DFU.	"piroxicam	50	59	Chemical/Drug"	"DFU	96	99	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""piroxicam"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""DFU"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Fetuses were delivered on GD 21 and routinely examined.	[]
Comprehensive clinical and developmental measurements were done.	[]
The pooled statistical analysis for ventricular septal ( VSD) and midline ( MD) defects was performed for rat fetuses exposed to piroxicam, selective and non - selective COX - 2 inhibitor based on present and historic data.	"piroxicam	129	138	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""piroxicam"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
RESULTS: Maternal toxicity, intrauterine growth retardation, and increase of external and skeletal variations were found in rats treated with the highest dose of piroxicam.	"piroxicam	162	171	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""piroxicam"", ""start_span"": 162, ""end_span"": 171, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Decrease of fetal length was the only signs of the DFU developmental toxicity observed in pups exposed to the highest compound dose.	"DFU	51	54	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""DFU"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Lack of teratogenicity was found in piroxicam and DFU - exposed groups.	"piroxicam	36	45	Chemical/Drug"	"DFU	50	53	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""piroxicam"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""DFU"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Prenatal exposure to non - selective COX inhibitors increases the risk of VSD and MD when compared to historic control but not with selective COX - 2 inhibitors.	[]
CONCLUSION: Both selective and non - selective COX - 2 inhibitors were toxic for rats fetuses when administered in the highest dose.	[]
Unlike DFU, piroxicam was also highly toxic to the dams.

Atrial fibrillation in young patients without structural heart disease is rare.	[]
Therefore, when the arrhythmia is present in this population, reversible causes must be identified and resolved.	[]
Thyroid disorders, illicit drug or stimulant use, and acute alcohol intoxication are among these causes.	[]
We report the case of a 30 - year - old Caucasian man who came to the emergency department in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.	[]
His medical history was unremarkable, except for minor fractures of the fingers and foot.	[]
Thyroid - stimulating hormone, magnesium, and potassium levels were within normal limits, urine drug screen was negative, and alcohol use was denied.

The half - life ( t1 / 2) of cocaine is relatively short, but some of the consequences of its use, such as seizures and strokes, can occur hours after exposure.	"cocaine	29	36	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cocaine"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
This led us to hypothesize that a metabolite of cocaine may be responsible for some of those delayed sequelae.	"cocaine	48	55	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cocaine"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We evaluated the potential of the major metabolite of cocaine, benzoylecgonine ( BE), to cause seizures.

Treated rats were then evaluated for incidence, latency, and seizure pattern or for locomotor activity in animals without seizures.	[]
BE - Induced seizures occurred more frequently and had significantly longer latencies than those induced by equimolar amounts of cocaine.	"BE	0	2	Chemical/Drug"	"cocaine	129	136	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""BE"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 2, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""cocaine"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Whereas cocaine - induced seizures were best characterized as brief, generalized, and tonic and resulted in death, those induced by BE were prolonged, often multiple and mixed in type, and rarely resulted in death.	"cocaine	8	15	Chemical/Drug"	"BE	132	134	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cocaine"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""BE"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Electrical recordings from the hippocampus showed a rhythmic progression in EEG frequency and voltage with clinical seizure expression.	[]

Variations of individuals were assessed by Wilcoxon ' s test.	[]
Relationship between those markers and demographic characteristics were investigated.	[]
RESULTS: Three months of raloxifene treatment was associated with a significant decrease in the plasma TAFI antigen concentrations ( 16% change, P < 0. 01), and a significant increase in tPA antigen concentrations ( 25% change, P < 0. 05).

The incidence of adverse events in the 2 groups was similar during the first 2 weeks of product use ( evaluation population: 55. 3% lozenge, 54. 7% gum), as well as during the entire study ( safety population: 63. 8% and 58. 6%, respectively).	[]
Stratification of patients by sex, age, extent of concurrent smoking, extent of product use, and severity of adverse events revealed no clinically significant differences between the lozenge and gum.	[]
The most common adverse events were nausea ( 17. 2% and 16. 1%; 95% CI, - 3. 7 to 6. 0), hiccups ( 10. 7% and 6. 6%; 95% CI, 0. 5 to 7. 8), and headache ( 8. 7% and 9. 9%; 95% Cl, - 5. 0 to 2. 6).	[]
Serious adverse events were reported in 11 and 13 patients in the respective groups.	[]
Fewer than 6% of patients in either group were considered by the investigator to have a worsening of their overall disease condition during the study.	[]

Pharmacological modulation of pain - related brain activity during normal and central sensitization states in humans.	[]
Abnormal processing of somatosensory inputs in the central nervous system ( central sensitization) is the mechanism accounting for the enhanced pain sensitivity in the skin surrounding tissue injury ( secondary hyperalgesia).	[]
Secondary hyperalgesia shares clinical characteristics with neurogenic hyperalgesia in patients with neuropathic pain.	[]
Abnormal brain responses to somatosensory stimuli have been found in patients with hyperalgesia as well as in normal subjects during experimental central sensitization.	[]
The aim of this study was to assess the effects of gabapentin, a drug effective in neuropathic pain patients, on brain processing of nociceptive information in normal and central sensitization states.

Investigation of mitochondrial involvement in the experimental model of epilepsy induced by pilocarpine.	"pilocarpine	92	103	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""pilocarpine"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Mitochondrial abnormalities have been associated with several aspects of epileptogenesis, such as energy generation, control of cell death, neurotransmitter synthesis, and free radical ( FR) production.	[]
Increased production of FRs may cause mtDNA damage leading to decreased activities of oxidative phosphorylation complexes containing mtDNA - encoded subunits.	[]
In this study, we investigated whether increased generation of FR during status epilepticus would be sufficient to provoke abnormalities in mtDNA and in the expression and activity of cytochrome c oxidase ( CCO), complex IV of the respiratory chain, in the chronic phase of the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy.	"pilocarpine	278	289	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""pilocarpine"", ""start_span"": 278, ""end_span"": 289, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
DNA analysis revealed low amounts of a 4. 8 kb mtDNA deletion but with no differences in frequency or quantity in the control and experimental groups.	[]
We did not find abnormalities in the expression and distribution of an mtDNA - encoded subunit of CCO ( CCO - I) or a relative decrease in CCO - I when compared with nuclear - encoded subunits ( CCO - IV and SDH - fp).	[]
No abnormality in CCO activity was observed through histochemistry.	[]
Although evidences of mitochondrial abnormalities were found in previously published studies, our results do not suggest that the FRs, generated during the acute phase, determined important abnormalities in mtDNA, in expression of CCO - I, and in CCO activity.	[]

The proportion of possibly avoidable cases due to drug interactions was estimated.	[]
RESULTS: Among 593 patients with cerebral haemorrhage, 59 ( 10%) were assessed as related to warfarin treatment.	"warfarin	93	101	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""warfarin"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
This imply an incidence of 1. 7 / 100, 000 treatment years.	[]
Of the 59 cases, 26 ( 44%) had a fatal outcome, compared to 136 ( 25%) among the non - warfarin patients ( p < 0. 01).	"warfarin	87	95	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""warfarin"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
A warfarin - drug interaction could have contributed to the haemorrhage in 24 ( 41%) of the warfarin patients and in 7 of these ( 12%) the bleeding complication was considered being possible to avoid.

Its role in the therapy of glomerulonephritis, autoimmunity, cystic renal diseases and renal cancer is under investigation.	[]
Because sirolimus does not share the vasomotor renal adverse effects exhibited by calcineurin inhibitors, it has been designated a ' non - nephrotoxic drug '.	"sirolimus	8	17	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sirolimus"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
However, clinical reports suggest that, under some circumstances, sirolimus is associated with proteinuria and acute renal dysfunction.	"sirolimus	66	75	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sirolimus"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
A common risk factor appears to be presence of pre - existing chronic renal damage.	[]
The mechanisms of sirolimus - associated proteinuria are multifactorial and may be due to an increase in glomerular capillary pressure following calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal.	"sirolimus	18	27	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sirolimus"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
It has also been suggested that sirolimus directly causes increased glomerular permeability / injury, but evidence for this mechanism is currently inconclusive.	"sirolimus	32	41	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sirolimus"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The acute renal dysfunction associated with sirolimus ( such as in delayed graft function) may be due to suppression of compensatory renal cell proliferation and survival / repair processes.

Although these adverse effects occur in some patients, their occurrence could be minimised by knowledge of the molecular effects of sirolimus on the kidney, the use of sirolimus in appropriate patient populations, close monitoring of proteinuria and renal function, use of angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers if proteinuria occurs and withdrawal if needed.

The CSS for Chromosomes 10 and 18 progressed to the most severe stages, diverging dramatically from the B6 phenotype.	[]
Latencies to stages were also significantly shorter for CSS10 and CSS18 mice.	[]
CSS mapping suggests seizure susceptibility loci on mouse Chromosomes 10 and 18.	[]
This approach provides a framework for identifying potentially novel homologous candidate genes for human temporal lobe epilepsy.	[]

BACKGROUND: Inhibition of cardiac sympathetic tone represents an important strategy for treatment of cardiovascular disease, including arrhythmia, coronary heart disease, and chronic heart failure.	[]
Activation of presynaptic alpha2 - adrenoceptors is the most widely accepted mechanism of action of the antisympathetic drug clonidine; however, other target proteins have been postulated to contribute to the in vivo actions of clonidine.

METHODS: This study was undertaken as part of neonatal screening for hearing impairment and involved both ears of 200 newborns.	[]
Newborns whose mothers reported smoking during pregnancy ( n = 200 ears) were compared to a control group of newborns ( n = 200 ears), whose mothers were non - smokers.	"smoking	32	39	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""smoking"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

RESULTS: In exposed neonates, TEOAEs mean response ( across frequency) and mean amplitude at 4000Hz was significantly lower than in non - exposed neonates.	[]

Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder presenting before 3 years of age with deficits in communication and social skills and repetitive behaviors.	[]
In addition to genetic influences, recent studies suggest that prenatal drug or chemical exposures are risk factors for autism.	[]
Terbutaline, a beta2 - adrenoceptor agonist used to arrest preterm labor, has been associated with increased concordance for autism in dizygotic twins.	"Terbutaline	0	11	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Terbutaline"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Newborn rats were given terbutaline ( 10 mg / kg) daily on postnatal days ( PN) 2 to 5 or PN 11 to 14 and examined 24 h after the last dose and at PN 30.	"terbutaline	24	35	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""terbutaline"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Immunohistochemical studies showed that administration of terbutaline on PN 2 to 5 produced a robust increase in microglial activation on PN 30 in the cerebral cortex, as well as in cerebellar and cerebrocortical white matter.	"terbutaline	58	69	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""terbutaline"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Upregulation of brain expression of P - glycoprotein in MRP2 - deficient TR ( -) rats resembles seizure - induced up - regulation of this drug efflux transporter in normal rats.	[]
PURPOSE: The multidrug resistance protein 2 ( MRP2) is a drug efflux transporter that is expressed predominantly at the apical domain of hepatocytes but seems also to be expressed at the apical membrane of brain capillary endothelial cells that form the blood - brain barrier ( BBB).	[]
MRP2 is absent in the transport - deficient ( TR ( -)) Wistar rat mutant, so that this rat strain was very helpful in defining substrates of MRP2 by comparing tissue concentrations or functional activities of compounds in MRP2 - deficient rats with those in transport - competent Wistar rats.	[]
By using this strategy to study the involvement of MRP2 in brain access of antiepileptic drugs ( AEDs), we recently reported that phenytoin is a substrate for MRP2 in the BBB.	"phenytoin	130	139	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""phenytoin"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
However, one drawback of such studies in genetically deficient rats is the fact that compensatory changes with upregulation of other transporters can occur.	[]
This prompted us to study the brain expression of P - glycoprotein ( Pgp), a major drug efflux transporter in many tissues, including the BBB, in TR ( -) rats compared with nonmutant ( wild - type) Wistar rats.	[]
METHODS: The expression of MRP2 and Pgp in brain and liver sections of TR ( -) rats and normal Wistar rats was determined with immunohistochemistry, by using a novel, highly selective monoclonal MRP2 antibody and the monoclonal Pgp antibody C219, respectively.	[]
RESULTS: Immunofluorescence staining with the MRP2 antibody was found to label a high number of microvessels throughout the brain in normal Wistar rats, whereas such labeling was absent in TR ( -) rats.	[]
TR ( -) rats exhibited a significant up - regulation of Pgp in brain capillary endothelial cells compared with wild - type controls.	[]
No such obvious upregulation of Pgp was observed in liver sections.	[]
A comparable overexpression of Pgp in the BBB was obtained after pilocarpine - induced seizures in wild - type Wistar rats.	"pilocarpine	65	76	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""pilocarpine"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Experiments with systemic administration of the Pgp substrate phenobarbital and the selective Pgp inhibitor tariquidar in TR ( -) rats substantiated that Pgp is functional and compensates for the lack of MRP2 in the BBB.	"phenobarbital	62	75	Chemical/Drug"	"tariquidar	108	118	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""phenobarbital"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""tariquidar"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
CONCLUSIONS: The data on TR ( -) rats indicate that Pgp plays an important role in the compensation of MRP2 deficiency in the BBB.	[]
Because such a compensatory mechanism most likely occurs to reduce injury to the brain from cytotoxic compounds, the present data substantiate the concept that MRP2 performs a protective role in the BBB.	[]
Furthermore, our data suggest that TR ( -) rats are an interesting tool to study consequences of overexpression of Pgp in the BBB on access of drugs in the brain, without the need of inducing seizures or other Pgp - enhancing events for this purpose.	[]

BACKGROUND: Electrocardiography has a very low sensitivity in detecting dobutamine - induced myocardial ischemia.	"dobutamine	72	82	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dobutamine"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
OBJECTIVES: To assess the added diagnostic value of a new cardiac performance index ( dP / dtejc) measurement, based on brachial artery flow changes, as compared to standard 12 - lead ECG, for detecting dobutamine - induced myocardial ischemia, using Tc99m - Sestamibi single - photon emission computed tomography as the gold standard of comparison to assess the presence or absence of ischemia.

In 19 of the 40 patients perfusion defects compatible with ischemia were detected on SPECT.	[]
The increase in dP / dtejc during infusion of dobutamine in this group was severely impaired as compared to the non - ischemic group.	"dobutamine	46	56	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dobutamine"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
dP / dtejc outcome was combined with the ECG results, giving an ECG - enhanced value, and compared to ECG alone.	[]
RESULTS: The sensitivity improved dramatically from 16% to 79%, positive predictive value increased from 60% to 68% and negative predictive value from 54% to 78%, and specificity decreased from 90% to 67%.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: If ECG alone is used for specificity, the combination with dP / dtejc improved the sensitivity of the test and could be a cost - savings alternative to cardiac imaging or perfusion studies to detect myocardial ischemia, especially in patients unable to exercise.	[]
Cocaine - induced myocardial infarction: clinical observations and pathogenetic considerations.	"Cocaine	0	7	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Cocaine"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Clinical and experimental data published to date suggest several possible mechanisms by which cocaine may result in acute myocardial infarction.	"cocaine	94	101	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cocaine"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In individuals with preexisting, high - grade coronary arterial narrowing, acute myocardial infarction may result from an increase in myocardial oxygen demand associated with cocaine - induced increase in rate - pressure product.	"oxygen	145	151	Chemical/Drug"	"cocaine	175	182	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""oxygen"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""cocaine"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 182, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In other individuals with no underlying atherosclerotic obstruction, coronary occlusion may be due to spasm, thrombus, or both.	[]
With regard to spasm, the clinical findings are largely circumstantial, and the locus of cocaine - induced vasoconstriction remains speculative.	"cocaine	89	96	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cocaine"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Although certain clinical and experimental findings support the hypothesis that spasm involves the epicardial, medium - size vessels, other data suggest intramural vasoconstriction.	[]
Diffuse intramural vasoconstriction is not consistent with reports of segmental, discrete infarction.	[]
Whereas certain in vivo data suggest that these effects are alpha - mediated, other in vitro data suggest the opposite.	[]
The finding of cocaine - induced vasoconstriction in segments of ( noninnervated) human umbilical artery suggests that the presence or absence of intact innervation is not sufficient to explain the discrepant data involving the possibility of alpha - mediated effects.

Among the 2000 spots compared for statistical difference, 67 spots were significantly changed in abundance and identified using matrix - assisted laser desorption / ionization time - of - flight MS, atmospheric pressure matrix - assisted laser desorption / ionization and HPLC coupled tandem MS ( LC / MS / MS).	[]
Out of these 67 proteins, LID significantly changed the expression level of five proteins: alphabeta - crystalin, gamma - enolase, guanidoacetate methyltransferase, vinculin, and proteasome alpha - 2 subunit.	[]
Complementary techniques such as western immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry were performed to investigate the validity of the data obtained using the proteomic approach.	[]
In conclusion, this study provides new insights into the protein changes occurring in LID.	[]

Serum creatinine ( SCr) levels and estimated glomerular filtration rate were assessed at baseline and 2 to 5 days after receiving medications.	"creatinine	6	16	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""creatinine"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The primary outcome was a postdose SCr increase > or = 0. 5 mg / dL ( 44. 2 micromol / L) over baseline.	[]
Secondary outcomes were a postdose SCr increase > or = 25%, a postdose estimated glomerular filtration rate decrease of > or = 25%, and the mean peak change in SCr.	[]
In 414 patients, contrast volume, presence of diabetes mellitus, use of N - acetylcysteine, mean baseline SCr, and estimated glomerular filtration rate were comparable in the 2 groups.

Such systemic lipopolysaccharide treatment mitigated methamphetamine - induced striatal dopamine and 3, 4 - dihydroxyphenylacetic acid depletions in a dose - dependent manner.

As the most potent dose ( 1 mg / kg) of lipopolysaccharide was administered two weeks, one day before or after the methamphetamine dosing regimen, methamphetamine - induced striatal dopamine and 3, 4 - dihydroxyphenylacetic acid depletions remained unaltered.

AIM: This study was carried out to determine the effect of injection duration on bruising and pain following the administration of the subcutaneous injection of heparin.	"heparin	161	168	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""heparin"", ""start_span"": 161, ""end_span"": 168, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
BACKGROUND: Although different methods to prevent bruising and pain following the subcutaneous injection of heparin have been widely studied and described, the effect of injection duration on the occurrence of bruising and pain is little documented.	"heparin	108	115	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""heparin"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
DESIGN: This study was designed as within - subject, quasi - experimental research.	[]
METHOD: The sample for the study consisted of 50 patients to whom subcutaneous heparin was administered.	"heparin	79	86	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""heparin"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Heparin was injected over 10 seconds on the right abdominal site and 30 seconds on the left abdominal site.	"Heparin	0	7	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Heparin"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Injections areas were assessed for the presence of bruising at 48 and 72 hours after each injection.	[]
Dimensions of the bruising on the heparin applied areas were measured using transparent millimetric measuring paper.	"heparin	34	41	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""heparin"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The visual analog scale ( VAS) was used to measure pain intensity and a stop - watch was used to time the pain period.	[]
Data were analysed using chi - square test, Mann - Whitney U, Wilcoxon signed ranks tests and correlation.	[]
RESULTS: The percentage of bruising occurrence was 64% with the injection of 10 seconds duration and 42% in the 30 - second injection.	[]
It was determined that the size of the bruising was smaller in the 30 - second injection.	[]
Pain intensity and pain period were statistically significantly lower for the 30 - second injection than for the 10 - second injection.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: It was determined that injection duration had an effect on bruising and pain following the subcutaneous administration of heparin.	"heparin	135	142	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""heparin"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
This study should be repeated on a larger sample.	[]
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: When administering subcutaneous heparin injections, it is important to extend the duration of the injection.	"heparin	64	71	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""heparin"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Acute liver failure in two patients with regular alcohol consumption ingesting paracetamol at therapeutic dosage.

BACKGROUND: The possible role of alcohol in the development of hepatotoxicity associated with therapeutic doses of paracetamol ( acetaminophen) is currently debated.	"alcohol	33	40	Chemical/Drug"	"paracetamol	115	126	Chemical/Drug"	"acetaminophen	129	142	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""alcohol"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""paracetamol"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""acetaminophen"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
CASE REPORT: We describe 2 patients who were regular consumers of alcohol and who developed liver failure within 3 - 5 days after hospitalization and stopping alcohol consumption while being treated with 4 g paracetamol / day.	"alcohol	66	73	Chemical/Drug"	"alcohol	66	73	Chemical/Drug"	"paracetamol	208	219	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""alcohol"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""alcohol"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""paracetamol"", ""start_span"": 208, ""end_span"": 219, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
A paracetamol serum level obtained in one of these patients was not in the toxic range.	"paracetamol	2	13	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""paracetamol"", ""start_span"": 2, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Possible risk factors for the development of hepatotoxicity in patients treated with therapeutic doses of paracetamol are discussed.	"paracetamol	106	117	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""paracetamol"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
CONCLUSION: In patients with risk factors, e. g. regular consumption of alcohol, liver failure is possible when therapeutic doses are ingested.	"alcohol	72	79	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""alcohol"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We propose that the paracetamol dose should not exceed 2 g / day in such patients and that their liver function should be monitored closely while being treated with paracetamol.

Associations between use of benzodiazepines or related drugs and health, physical abilities and cognitive function: a non - randomised clinical study in the elderly.	"benzodiazepines	28	43	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""benzodiazepines"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
OBJECTIVE: To describe associations between the use of benzodiazepines or related drugs ( BZDs / RDs) and health, functional abilities and cognitive function in the elderly.	"benzodiazepines	55	70	Chemical/Drug"	"BZDs	90	94	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""benzodiazepines"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""BZDs"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METHODS: A non - randomised clinical study of patients aged > or = 65 years admitted to acute hospital wards during 1 month.	[]
164 patients ( mean age + / - standard deviation [ SD] 81. 6 + / - 6. 8 years) were admitted.	[]
Of these, nearly half ( n = 78) had used BZDs / RDs before admission, and the remainder ( n = 86) were non - users.	"BZDs	41	45	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""BZDs"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Cognitive ability was assessed by the Mini - Mental State Examination ( MMSE).	[]
Patients scoring > or = 20 MMSE sum points were interviewed ( n = 79) and questioned regarding symptoms and functional abilities during the week prior to admission.	[]
Data on use of BZDs / RDs before admission, current medications and discharge diagnoses were collected from medical records.	"BZDs	15	19	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""BZDs"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Health, physical abilities and cognitive function were compared between BZD / RD users and non - users, and adjustments were made for confounding variables.	[]
The residual serum concentrations of oxazepam, temazepam and zopiclone were analysed.	"oxazepam	37	45	Chemical/Drug"	"temazepam	47	56	Chemical/Drug"	"zopiclone	61	70	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""oxazepam"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""temazepam"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""zopiclone"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
RESULTS: The mean + / - SD duration of BZD / RD use was 7 + / - 7 years ( range 1 - 31).	[]
Two or three BZDs / RDs were concomitantly taken by 26% of users ( n = 20).	"BZDs	13	17	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""BZDs"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Long - term use of these drugs was associated with female sex and use of a higher number of drugs with effects on the CNS, which tended to be related to diagnosed dementia.	[]
After adjustment for these variables as confounders, use of BZDs / RDs was not associated with cognitive function as measured by the MMSE.	"BZDs	60	64	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""BZDs"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
However, use of BZDs / RDs was associated with dizziness, inability to sleep after awaking at night and tiredness in the mornings during the week prior to admission and with stronger depressive symptoms measured at the beginning of the hospital stay.	"BZDs	16	20	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""BZDs"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Use of BZDs / RDs tended to be associated with a reduced ability to walk and shorter night - time sleep during the week prior to admission.	"BZDs	7	11	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""BZDs"", ""start_span"": 7, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
A higher residual serum concentration of temazepam correlated with a lower MMSE sum score after adjustment for confounding variables.	"temazepam	41	50	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""temazepam"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
CONCLUSIONS: Long - term use and concomitant use of more than one BZD / RD were common in elderly patients hospitalised because of acute illnesses.	[]
Long - term use was associated with daytime and night - time symptoms indicative of poorer health and potentially caused by the adverse effects of these drugs.	[]

She was not an alcoholic.	[]
For the first few days after ingestion, she was in a confused state and had mild to moderate ataxia and giddiness.	[]
She noticed hoarseness and distally accentuated motor and sensory dysfunction after she had recovered from this state.	[]
A nerve conduction study was consistent with severe sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy.	[]
Laryngeal electromyography ( thyroarytenoid muscle) showed ample denervation potentials.	[]
Laryngoscopy revealed asymmetric vocal fold movements during phonation.	[]
Her vocal change and weakness began to improve spontaneously about 3 weeks after transfer.	[]
This was a case of acute palsy of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and superimposed severe acute sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy caused by high - dose disulfiram intoxication.

BACKGROUND: Cocaine is a widely abused psychostimulant that has both rewarding and aversive properties.	"Cocaine	12	19	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Cocaine"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
While the mechanisms underlying cocaine ' s rewarding effects have been studied extensively, less attention has been paid to the unpleasant behavioral states induced by cocaine, such as anxiety.

METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the performance of dopamine beta - hydroxylase knockout ( Dbh - / -) mice, which lack norepinephrine ( NE), in the elevated plus maze ( EPM) to examine the contribution of noradrenergic signaling to cocaine - induced anxiety.	"dopamine	56	64	Chemical/Drug"	"norepinephrine	123	137	Chemical/Drug"	"NE	140	142	Chemical/Drug"	"cocaine	236	243	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dopamine"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""norepinephrine"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""NE"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""cocaine"", ""start_span"": 236, ""end_span"": 243, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
RESULTS: We found that cocaine dose - dependently increased anxiety - like behavior in control ( Dbh + / -) mice, as measured by a decrease in open arm exploration.	"cocaine	23	30	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cocaine"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The Dbh - / - mice had normal baseline performance in the EPM but were completely resistant to the anxiogenic effects of cocaine.	"cocaine	121	128	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cocaine"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Cocaine - induced anxiety was also attenuated in Dbh + / - mice following administration of disulfiram, a dopamine beta - hydroxylase ( DBH) inhibitor.

Hypothalamic prolactin receptor messenger ribonucleic acid levels, prolactin signaling, and hyperprolactinemic inhibition of pulsatile luteinizing hormone secretion are dependent on estradiol.

Hyperprolactinemia can reduce fertility and libido.	[]
Although central prolactin actions are thought to contribute to this, the mechanisms are poorly understood.	[]
We first tested whether chronic hyperprolactinemia inhibited two neuroendocrine parameters necessary for female fertility: pulsatile LH secretion and the estrogen - induced LH surge.	"estrogen	154	162	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""estrogen"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 162, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Chronic hyperprolactinemia induced by the dopamine antagonist sulpiride caused a 40% reduction LH pulse frequency in ovariectomized rats, but only in the presence of chronic low levels of estradiol.

Sulpiride did not affect the magnitude of a steroid - induced LH surge or the percentage of GnRH neurons activated during the surge.

Estradiol is known to influence expression of the long form of prolactin receptors ( PRL - R) and components of prolactin ' s signaling pathway.	"Estradiol	0	9	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Estradiol"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
To test the hypothesis that estrogen increases PRL - R expression and sensitivity to prolactin, we next demonstrated that estradiol greatly augments prolactin - induced STAT5 activation.	"estrogen	28	36	Chemical/Drug"	"estradiol	122	131	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""estrogen"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""estradiol"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Lastly, we measured PRL - R and suppressor of cytokine signaling ( SOCS - 1 and - 3 and CIS, which reflect the level of prolactin signaling) mRNAs in response to sulpiride and estradiol.	"sulpiride	162	171	Chemical/Drug"	"estradiol	176	185	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sulpiride"", ""start_span"": 162, ""end_span"": 171, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""estradiol"", ""start_span"": 176, ""end_span"": 185, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Sulpiride induced only SOCS - 1 in the medial preoptic area, where GnRH neurons are regulated, but in the arcuate nucleus and choroid plexus, PRL - R, SOCS - 3, and CIS mRNA levels were also induced.	"Sulpiride	0	9	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Sulpiride"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Estradiol enhanced these effects on SOCS - 3 and CIS.	"Estradiol	0	9	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Estradiol"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Interestingly, estradiol also induced PRL - R, SOCS - 3, and CIS mRNA levels independently.	"estradiol	15	24	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""estradiol"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
These data show that GnRH pulse frequency is inhibited by chronic hyperprolactinemia in a steroid - dependent manner.	"steroid	90	97	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""steroid"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Renal Fanconi syndrome and myopathy after liver transplantation: drug - related mitochondrial cytopathy?	[]
Advances in the field of transplantation provide a better quality of life and allow more favorable conditions for growth and development in children.	[]
However, combinations of different therapeutic regimens require consideration of potential adverse reactions.	[]
We describe a 15 - yr - old girl who had orthotopic liver transplantation because of Wilson ' s disease.	[]

RESULTS: Forty of 94 HIT patients had thrombosis at diagnosis; 54 / 94 had isolated - HIT without thrombosis.	[]
Eight of the isolated - HIT patients developed thrombosis within the next 30 d; thus, a total of 48 patients had thrombosis at day 30.	[]
At diagnosis there was no significant difference in OD between HIT patients with thrombosis and those with isolated - HIT.	[]
However, OD was significantly higher in all patients with thrombosis ( n = 48, 1. 34 + / - 0. 89), including isolated - HIT patients who later developed thrombosis within 30 d ( n = 8, 1. 84 + / - 0. 64) as compared to isolated - HIT patients who did not develop thrombosis ( 0. 96 + / - 0. 75; P = 0. 011 and P = 0. 008).	[]
The Receiver Operative Characteristic Curve showed that OD > 1. 27 in the isolated - HIT group had a significantly higher chance of developing thrombosis by day 30.	[]
None of these groups showed significant difference in percent inhibition.	[]
Multivariate analysis showed a 2. 8 - fold increased risk of thrombosis in females.	[]
Similarly, thrombotic risk increased with age and OD values.	[]
CONCLUSION: Higher OD is associated with significant risk of subsequent thrombosis in patients with isolated - HIT; percent inhibition, however, was not predictive.	[]

[ Nat. Neurosci. 9 ( 2006), 917] recently identified the microglial - specific fractalkine receptor ( CX3CR1) as an important mediator of MPTP - induced neurodegeneration of DA neurons.

Because the CNS damage caused by METH and MPTP is highly selective for the DA neuronal system in mouse models of neurotoxicity, we hypothesized that the CX3CR1 plays a role in METH - induced neurotoxicity and microglial activation.

"METH	142	146	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""METH"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METH depleted DA, caused microglial activation, and increased body temperature in CX3CR1 knockout mice to the same extent and over the same time course seen in wild - type controls.

This response was restricted to the striatum and contrasted sharply with unresponsive eGFP - microglia in surrounding brain areas that are not damaged by METH.	"METH	154	158	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""METH"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Pretreatment with either VPU ( 50 and 100 mg / kg) or VPA ( 300 and 600 mg / kg) completely abolished pilocarpine - evoked increases in extracellular glutamate and aspartate.

In addition, a statistically significant reduction was also observed on the level of GABA and glycine but less than a drastic reduction of glutamate and aspartate level.

Based on the finding that VPU and VPA could protect the animals against pilocarpine - induced seizure it is suggested that the reduction of inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitters was comparatively minor and offset by a pronounced reduction of glutamate and aspartate.

Therefore, like VPA, the finding that VPU could drastically reduce pilocarpine - induced increases in glutamate and aspartate should account, at least partly, for its anticonvulsant activity observed in pilocarpine - induced seizure in experimental animals.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Despite advantages of induction and maintenance of anaesthesia with sevoflurane, postoperative nausea and vomiting occurs frequently.	"sevoflurane	94	105	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sevoflurane"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Fentanyl is a commonly used supplement that may contribute to this, although it may also improve analgesia.	"Fentanyl	0	8	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Fentanyl"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METHODS: This double - blind study examined the incidence and severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting and pain in the first 24 h after sevoflurane anaesthesia in 216 adult day surgery patients.	"sevoflurane	141	152	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sevoflurane"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Patients were randomly allocated to either receive or not receive 1 1 fentanyl, while a third group received dexamethasone in addition to fentanyl.

RESULTS: Omission of fentanyl did not reduce the overall incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, but did reduce the incidence of vomiting and / or moderate to severe nausea prior to discharge from 20% and 17% with fentanyl and fentanyl - dexamethasone, respectively, to 5% ( P = 0. 013).

Antiemetic requirements were reduced from 24% and 31% to 7% ( P = 0. 0012).	[]
Dexamethasone had no significant effect on the incidence or severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting.	"Dexamethasone	0	13	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Dexamethasone"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Combining the two fentanyl groups revealed further significant benefits from the avoidance of opioids, reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting and nausea prior to discharge from 35% and 33% to 22% and 19% ( P = 0. 049 and P = 0. 035), respectively, while nausea in the first 24 h was decreased from 42% to 27% ( P = 0. 034).	"fentanyl	18	26	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""fentanyl"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Pain severity and analgesic requirements were unaffected by the omission of fentanyl.	"fentanyl	76	84	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""fentanyl"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Fentanyl did reduce minor intraoperative movement but had no sevoflurane - sparing effect and increased respiratory depression, hypotension and bradycardia.

We then examined the morphology, expression of beclin 1 gene, mitochondrial permeability transition ( MPT), and Na + - K + ATPase activity in vivo.	"K	119	120	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""K"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We also assessed cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential changes and counted autophagic vacuoles in cultured cardiomyocytes.	[]
In addition, we analyzed the expression of autophagy associated gene, beclin 1 using RT - PCR and Western blotting in an animal model.	[]

Transient cranial nerve dysfunction has been described in a few cases with topical papaverine.	"papaverine	83	93	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""papaverine"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
This study supports previous reports and provides neurophysiological evidence of an adverse effect on the auditory nerve.	[]
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 70 consecutive microvascular decompression operations and studied those patients who received topical papaverine for vasospasm.	"papaverine	150	160	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""papaverine"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 160, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Topical papaverine was used as a direct therapeutic action to manage vasospasm in a total of 11 patients.	"papaverine	8	18	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""papaverine"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The timing of papaverine application and ongoing operative events was reviewed relative to changes in neurophysiological recordings.	"papaverine	14	24	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""papaverine"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Brainstem auditory evoked potentials ( BAEPs) were routinely used to monitor cochlear nerve function during these operations.	[]
FINDINGS: A temporal relationship was found between topical papaverine and BAEP changes leading to complete waveform loss.	"papaverine	60	70	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""papaverine"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The average temporal delay between papaverine and the onset of an adverse BAEP change was 5 min.	"papaverine	35	45	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""papaverine"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In 10 of 11 patients, BAEP waves II / III - V completely disappeared within 2 to 25 min after papaverine.	"papaverine	94	104	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""papaverine"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Eight of these 10 patients had complete loss of BAEP waveforms within 10 min.	[]
One patient showed no recovery of later waves and a delayed profound sensorineural hearing loss.	[]
The average recovery time of BAEP waveforms to pre - papaverine baseline values was 39 min.	"papaverine	53	63	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""papaverine"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
CONCLUSIONS: Topical papaverine for the treatment of vasospasm was associated with the onset of a transient disturbance in neurophysiological function of the ascending auditory brainstem pathway.	"papaverine	21	31	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""papaverine"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Ezetimibe undergoes extensive glucuronidation by uridine diphosphate glucoronosyltransferases ( UGT) in the intestine and liver and may have inhibited the glucuronidation of simvastatin hydroxy acid, resulting in increased simvastatin exposure and subsequent hepatotoxicity.

The aldosterone - sensitive serum - and glucocorticoid - inducible kinase SGK1 has been shown to participate in the stimulation of ENaC and to mediate renal fibrosis following mineralocorticoid and salt excess.	"aldosterone	4	15	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""aldosterone"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The present study was performed to elucidate the role of SGK1 in the volume retention and fibrosis during nephrotic syndrome.	[]
To this end, doxorubicin ( 15 mug / g body wt) was injected intravenously into gene - targeted mice lacking SGK1 ( sgk1 ( - / -)) and their wild - type littermates ( sgk1 ( + / +)).	"doxorubicin	13	24	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""doxorubicin"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Doxorubicin treatment resulted in heavy proteinuria ( > 100 mg protein / mg crea) in 15 / 44 of sgk1 ( + / +) and 15 / 44 of sgk1 ( - / -) mice leading to severe nephrotic syndrome with ascites, lipidemia, and hypoalbuminemia in both genotypes.

INTRODUCTION: Many substances that form methemoglobin ( MHb) effectively counter cyanide ( CN) toxicity.	[]
Although MHb formers are generally applied as treatments for CN poisoning, it has been proposed that a stable, long - acting MHb former could serve as a CN pretreatment.	[]
Using this rationale, the 8 - aminoquinoline WR242511, a potent long - lasting MHb former in rodents and beagle dogs, was studied in the rhesus monkey for advanced development as a potential CN pretreatment.	"8 - aminoquinoline	26	44	Chemical/Drug"	"WR242511	45	53	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""8 - aminoquinoline"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""WR242511"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METHODS: In this study, WR242511 was administered intravenously ( IV) in 2 female and 4 male rhesus monkeys in doses of 3. 5 and / or 7. 0 mg / kg; a single male also received WR242511 orally ( PO) at 7. 0 mg / kg.

Health status and MHb levels were monitored following exposure.	[]
RESULTS: The selected doses of WR242511, which produced significant methemoglobinemia in beagle dogs in earlier studies conducted elsewhere, produced very little MHb ( mean < 2. 0%) in the rhesus monkey.	"WR242511	31	39	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""WR242511"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Furthermore, transient hemoglobinuria was noted approximately 60 minutes postinjection of WR242511 ( 3. 5 or 7. 0 mg / kg), and 2 lethalities occurred ( one IV and one PO) following the 7. 0 mg / kg dose.	"WR242511	90	98	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""WR242511"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Myoglobinuria was also observed following the 7. 0 mg / kg dose.	[]
Histopathology analyses in the 2 animals that died revealed liver and kidney toxicity, with greater severity in the orally - treated animal.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate direct and / or indirect drug - induced toxicity.	[]
It is concluded that WR242511 should not be pursued as a pretreatment for CN poisoning unless the anti - CN characteristics of this compound can be successfully dissociated from those producing undesirable toxicity.

"In a placebo - controlled, single - blinded, crossover study, we assessed the effect of "" real "" repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS) versus "" sham "" rTMS ( placebo) on peak dose dyskinesias in patients with Parkinson ' s disease ( PD)."	[]
Ten patients with PD and prominent dyskinesias had rTMS ( 1, 800 pulses; 1 Hz rate) delivered over the motor cortex for 4 consecutive days twice, once real stimuli and once sham stimulation were used; evaluations were done at the baseline and 1 day after the end of each of the treatment series.	[]
Direct comparison between sham and real rTMS effects showed no significant difference in clinician - assessed dyskinesia severity.	[]
However, comparison with the baseline showed small but significant reduction in dyskinesia severity following real rTMS but not placebo.	[]
The major effect was on dystonia subscore.	[]
Similarly, in patient diaries, although both treatments caused reduction in subjective dyskinesia scores during the days of intervention, the effect was sustained for 3 days after the intervention for the real rTMS only.	[]
Following rTMS, no side effects and no adverse effects on motor function and PD symptoms were noted.	[]
The results suggest the existence of residual beneficial clinical aftereffects of consecutive daily applications of low - frequency rTMS on dyskinesias in PD.	[]

Irreversible damage to the medullary interstitium in experimental analgesic nephropathy in F344 rats.	[]
Renal papillary necrosis ( RPN) and a decreased urinary concentrating ability developed during continuous long - term treatment with aspirin and paracetamol in female Fischer 344 rats.

Renal structure and concentrating ability were examined after a recovery period of up to 18 weeks, when no analgesics were given, to investigate whether the analgesic - induced changes were reversible.	[]
There was no evidence of repair to the damaged medullary interstitial matrix, or proliferation of remaining undamaged type 1 medullary interstitial cells after the recovery period following analgesic treatment.	[]
The recovery of urinary concentrating ability was related to the length of analgesic treatment and the extent of the resulting inner medullary structural damage.	[]
During the early stages of analgesic treatment, the changes in urinary concentrating ability were reversible, but after prolonged analgesic treatment, maximum urinary concentrating ability failed to recover.	[]
This study shows that prolonged analgesic treatment in Fischer 344 rats causes progressive and irreversible damage to the interstitial matrix and type 1 interstitial cells leading to RPN.	[]
The associated urinary concentrating defect is reversible only during the early stages of structural damage to the inner medulla.	[]

HS diet for 4 wk increased renal cortical angiotensinogen mRNA and protein only in male DS, which was prevented by castration.	[]
Ovariectomy of female DS had no effect on intrarenal angiotensinogen expression on either diet.	[]
Radiotelemetric BP was similar between males and castrated rats on LS diet.	[]
HS diet for 4 wk caused a progressive increase in BP, protein and albumin excretion, and glomerular sclerosis in male DS rats, which were attenuated by castration.	[]

Pain memory is thought to affect future pain sensitivity and thus contribute to clinical pain conditions.	[]
Systematic investigations of the human capacity to remember sensory features of experimental pain are sparse.	[]
In order to address long - term pain memory, nine healthy male volunteers received intradermal injections of three doses of capsaicin ( 0. 05, 1 and 20 microg, separated by 15 min breaks), each given three times in a balanced design across three sessions at one week intervals.	"capsaicin	124	133	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""capsaicin"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Pain rating was performed using a computerized visual analogue scale ( 0 - 100) digitized at 1 / s, either immediately online or one hour or one day after injection.	[]
Subjects also recalled their pains one week later.	[]
Capsaicin injection reliably induced a dose - dependent flare ( p < 0. 001) without any difference within or across sessions.	"Capsaicin	0	9	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Capsaicin"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The strong burning pain decayed exponentially within a few minutes.	[]
Subjects were able to reliably discriminate pain magnitude and duration across capsaicin doses ( both p < 0. 001), regardless of whether first - time ratings were requested immediately, after one hour or after one day.	"capsaicin	79	88	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""capsaicin"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Pain recall after one week was similarly precise ( magnitude: p < 0. 01, duration: p < 0. 05).	[]
Correlation with rating recall after one week was best when first - time ratings were requested as late as one day after injection ( R ( 2) = 0. 79) indicating that both rating retrievals utilized similar memory traces.	[]
These results indicate a reliable memory for magnitude and duration of experimentally induced pain.	[]
The data further suggest that the consolidation of this memory is an important interim stage, and may take up to one day.	[]

METHODS: The changes in pain thresholds were determined using mechanical stimuli - - the modification of the classic paw withdrawal test described by Randall - Selitto.	[]
RESULTS: The results of this paper confirm that inhibition of bradykinin receptors and inducible NO synthase but not neuronal NO synthase activity reduces diabetic hyperalgesia.

It was also shown that both products of inducible NO synthase and neuronal NO synthase activation as well as bradykinin are involved in hyperalgesia produced by vincristine.

Moreover, L - NOArg and 7 - NI but not L - NIL intensify antihyperalgesic activity of HOE 140 or des - Arg10HOE 140 in toxic neuropathy.

CONCLUSIONS: Results of these studies suggest that B1 and B2 receptors are engaged in transmission of nociceptive stimuli in both diabetic and toxic neuropathy.	[]
In streptozotocin - induced hyperalgesia, inducible NO synthase participates in pronociceptive activity of bradykinin, whereas in vincristine - induced hyperalgesia bradykinin seemed to activate neuronal NO synthase pathway.

Some case reports are published in the literature but no systematic study from a sample of patients has been published.	[]
We performed this study in order to describe the main characteristics of this adverse drug reaction.	[]
METHODS: Using the French Pharmacovigilance database, we selected the cases of confusion reported since 1985 with valproic acid.	"valproic acid	114	127	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""valproic acid"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
RESULTS: 272 cases of confusion were reported with valproic acid: 153 women and 119 men.	"valproic acid	51	64	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""valproic acid"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Confusion mostly occurred during the two first weeks following valproic acid exposure ( 39. 7%).	"valproic acid	63	76	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""valproic acid"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

OBJECTIVE: This is to present reversible inferior colliculus lesions in metronidazole - induced encephalopathy, to focus on the diffusion - weighted imaging ( DWI) and fluid attenuated inversion recovery ( FLAIR) imaging.	"metronidazole	72	85	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""metronidazole"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From November 2005 to September 2007, 8 patients ( 5 men and 3 women) were diagnosed as having metronidazole - induced encephalopathy ( age range; 43 - 78 years).	"metronidazole	118	131	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""metronidazole"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
They had been taking metronidazole ( total dosage, 45 - 120 g; duration, 30 days to 2 months) to treat the infection in various organs.	"metronidazole	21	34	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""metronidazole"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Initial brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) were obtained after the hospitalization, including DWI ( 8 / 8), apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC) map ( 4 / 8), FLAIR ( 7 / 8), and T2 - weighted image ( 8 / 8).	[]
Follow - up MRIs were performed on 5 patients from third to 14th days after discontinuation of metronidazole administration.	"metronidazole	95	108	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""metronidazole"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Findings of initial and follow - up MRIs were retrospectively evaluated by 2 neuroradiologists by consensus, to analyze the presence of abnormal signal intensities, their locations, and signal changes on follow - up images.	[]
RESULTS: Initial MRIs showed abnormal high signal intensities on DWI and FLAIR ( or T2 - weighted image) at the dentate nucleus ( 8 / 8), inferior colliculus ( 6 / 8), corpus callosum ( 2 / 8), pons ( 2 / 8), medulla ( 1 / 8), and bilateral cerebral white matter ( 1 / 8).	[]
High - signal intensity lesions on DWI tended to show low signal intensity on ADC map ( 3 / 4), but in one patient, high signal intensity was shown at bilateral dentate nuclei on not only DWI but also ADC map.	[]
All the lesions in dentate, inferior colliculus, pons, and medullas had been resolved completely on follow - up MRIs in 5 patients, but in 1 patient of them, corpus callosal lesion persisted.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: Reversible inferior colliculus lesions could be considered as the characteristic for metronidazole - induced encephalopathy, next to the dentate nucleus involvement.

BACKGROUND: Sirolimus is the latest immunosuppressive agent used to prevent rejection, and may have less nephrotoxicity than calcineurin inhibitor ( CNI) - based regimens.	"Sirolimus	12	21	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Sirolimus"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
To date there has been little documentation of clinically significant proteinuria linked with the use of sirolimus.	"sirolimus	105	114	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sirolimus"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We have encountered several patients who developed substantial proteinuria associated with sirolimus use.	"sirolimus	91	100	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sirolimus"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In each patient, the close temporal association between the commencement of sirolimus therapy and proteinuria implicated sirolimus as the most likely etiology of the proteinuria.

METHODS: We analyzed the clinical and laboratory information available for all 119 patients transplanted at the Washington Hospital Center between 1999 - 2003 for whom sirolimus was a component of their immunosuppressant regimen.	"sirolimus	168	177	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sirolimus"", ""start_span"": 168, ""end_span"": 177, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In these patients, the magnitude of proteinuria was assessed on morning urine samples by turbidometric measurement or random urine protein: creatinine ratios, an estimate of grams of proteinuria / day.	"creatinine	140	150	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""creatinine"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

RESULTS: Twenty - eight patients ( 24%) developed increased proteinuria from baseline during their post - transplantation course.	[]
In 21 patients an alternative cause of proteinuria was either obvious or insufficient data was available to be conclusive.	[]
In 7 of the 28 patients there was a striking temporal association between the initiation of sirolimus and the development of nephrotic - range proteinuria.	"sirolimus	92	101	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sirolimus"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Here we show that perceived pain intensity in secondary hyperalgesia is decreased when attention is distracted away from the painful pinprick stimulus with a visual task.	[]
Furthermore, it was found that the magnitude of attentional modulation in secondary hyperalgesia is very similar to that of capsaicin - untreated, control condition.

Patients were evaluated by neurological examinations, questionnaires and sensory - motor nerve conduction studies.	[]
There was no significant difference in the frequency of signs or symptoms between the two groups although neurotoxicity symptoms presented mostly with lower scores of severity in group G.	[]
However, this difference reached statistical significance only with regard to reported pain sensation ( P = 0. 011).	[]
Also the frequency of abnormal electro - diagnostic findings showed similarity between the two groups ( G: 7 / 23 = 30. 4%; P: 6 / 20 = 30%).	[]

Replication - competent HBV strains with sG145R or sP120T and LAM resistance ( rtM204I or rtL180M / rtM204V) were generated on an HBeAg - positive and an HBeAg - negative background with precore ( PC) and basal core promoter ( BCP) mutants.

The sG145R mutation strongly reduced HBsAg levels and was able to fully restore the impaired replication of LAM - resistant HBV mutants to the levels of wild - type HBV, and PC or BCP mutations further enhanced viral replication.	"HBsAg	37	42	Chemical/Drug"	"LAM	108	111	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""HBsAg"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""LAM"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Although the sP120T substitution also impaired HBsAg secretion, it did not enhance the replication of LAM - resistant clones.

However, the concomitant occurrence of HBeAg negativity ( PC / BCP), sP120T, and LAM resistance resulted in the restoration of replication to levels of wild - type HBV.

In all clones with combined immune escape and LAM resistance mutations, the nucleotide analogues adefovir and tenofovir remained effective in suppressing viral replication in vitro.

These findings reveal the differential impact of immune escape variants on the replication and drug susceptibility of complex HBV mutants, supporting the need of close surveillance and treatment adjustment in response to the selection of distinct mutational patterns.	[]

BACKGROUND: Vasopressor agents are used to correct anesthesia - induced hypotension.	[]
We describe the effect of phenylephrine and ephedrine on frontal lobe oxygenation ( S ( c) O ( 2)) following anesthesia - induced hypotension.

METHODS: Following induction of anesthesia by fentanyl ( 0. 15 mg kg ( - 1)) and propofol ( 2. 0 mg kg ( - 1)), 13 patients received phenylephrine ( 0. 1 mg iv) and 12 patients received ephedrine ( 10 mg iv) to restore mean arterial pressure ( MAP).

Heart rate ( HR), MAP, stroke volume ( SV), cardiac output ( CO), and frontal lobe oxygenation ( S ( c) O ( 2)) were registered.	[]
RESULTS: Induction of anesthesia was followed by a decrease in MAP, HR, SV, and CO concomitant with an elevation in S ( c) O ( 2).	[]
After administration of phenylephrine, MAP increased ( 51 + / - 12 to 81 + / - 13 mmHg; P < 0. 001; mean + / - SD).	"phenylephrine	24	37	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""phenylephrine"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
However, a 14% ( from 70 + / - 8% to 60 + / - 7%) reduction in S ( c) O ( 2) ( P < 0. 05) followed with no change in CO ( 3. 7 + / - 1. 1 to 3. 4 + / - 0. 9 l min ( - 1)).	[]
The administration of ephedrine led to a similar increase in MAP ( 53 + / - 9 to 79 + / - 8 mmHg; P < 0. 001), restored CO ( 3. 2 + / - 1. 2 to 5. 0 + / - 1. 3 l min ( - 1)), and preserved S ( c) O ( 2).	"ephedrine	22	31	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ephedrine"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
CONCLUSIONS: The utilization of phenylephrine to correct hypotension induced by anesthesia has a negative impact on S ( c) O ( 2) while ephedrine maintains frontal lobe oxygenation potentially related to an increase in CO.

BACKGROUND: Direct thrombin inhibitors ( DTIs) provide an alternative method of anticoagulation for patients with a history of heparin - induced thrombocytopenia ( HIT) or HIT with thrombosis ( HITT) undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB).	"heparin	127	134	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""heparin"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In the following report, a 65 - year - old critically ill patient with a suspected history of HITT was administered argatroban for anticoagulation on bypass during heart transplantation.	"argatroban	116	126	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""argatroban"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The patient required massive transfusion support ( 55 units of red blood cells, 42 units of fresh - frozen plasma, 40 units of cryoprecipitate, 40 units of platelets, and three doses of recombinant Factor VIIa) for severe intraoperative and postoperative bleeding.	[]
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma samples from before and after CPB were analyzed postoperatively for argatroban concentration using a modified ecarin clotting time ( ECT) assay.	"argatroban	101	111	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""argatroban"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
RESULTS: Unexpectedly high concentrations of argatroban were measured in these samples ( range, 0 - 32 microg / mL), and a prolonged plasma argatroban half life ( t ( 1 / 2)) of 514 minutes was observed ( published elimination t ( 1 / 2) is 39 - 51 minutes [ < or = 181 minutes with hepatic impairment]).

Efficacy was evaluated using the Clinical Global Impression - Sexual Function ( CGI - SF; the primary outcome measure), the International Index of Erectile Function ( IIEF), Arizona Sexual Experience Scale ( ASEX), and Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction ( EDITS) ( secondary outcome measures).	[]
Participants were followed biweekly during study period.	[]
RESULTS: After 12 weeks of treatment, the mean ( sd) scores for CGI - SF were significantly lower, i. e. better, in patients on bupropion SR, at 2. 4 ( 1. 2), than in the placebo group, at 3. 9 ( 1. 1) ( P = 0. 01).	"bupropion	128	137	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""bupropion"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Men who received bupropion had a significant increase in the total IIEF score ( 54. 4% vs 1. 2%; P = 0. 003), and in the five different domains of the IIEF.	"bupropion	17	26	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""bupropion"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Total ASEX scores were significantly lower, i. e. better, among men who received bupropion than placebo, at 15. 5 ( 4. 3) vs 21. 5 ( 4. 7) ( P = 0. 002).	"bupropion	81	90	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""bupropion"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Prevention of seizures and reorganization of hippocampal functions by transplantation of bone marrow cells in the acute phase of experimental epilepsy.	[]
In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of bone marrow mononuclear cells ( BMCs) in a model of epilepsy induced by pilocarpine in rats.	"pilocarpine	132	143	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""pilocarpine"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
BMCs obtained from green fluorescent protein ( GFP) transgenic mice or rats were transplanted intravenously after induction of status epilepticus ( SE).	[]
Spontaneous recurrent seizures ( SRS) were monitored using Racine ' s seizure severity scale.	[]
All of the rats in the saline - treated epileptic control group developed SRS, whereas none of the BMC - treated epileptic animals had seizures in the short term ( 15 days after transplantation), regardless of the BMC source.	[]
Over the long - term chronic phase ( 120 days after transplantation), only 25% of BMC - treated epileptic animals had seizures, but with a lower frequency and duration compared to the epileptic control group.	[]
The density of hippocampal neurons in the brains of animals treated with BMCs was markedly preserved.	[]
At hippocampal Schaeffer collateral - CA1 synapses, long - term potentiation was preserved in BMC - transplanted rats compared to epileptic controls.	[]
The donor - derived GFP ( +) cells were rarely found in the brains of transplanted epileptic rats.	[]
In conclusion, treatment with BMCs can prevent the development of chronic seizures, reduce neuronal loss, and influence the reorganization of the hippocampal neuronal network.	[]

Transient hypotension ( SAP < 90mmHg) occurred in 1 patient ( 0. 7%).	[]
The multivariate analysis showed that severe MR, MP ( EF < 45%) and high doses of MZ ( > 5mg) were associated with events ( p < 0. 001).	"MZ	82	84	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""MZ"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The EF was 40%, in the group with MP and 44% in the group with severe MR and it can be a factor associated with clinical events in the last group.	[]
CONCLUSION: TEE with sedation presents a low rate of events.	[]
There were no severe events and there was no need to interrupt the examinations.	[]
Effect of direct intracoronary administration of methylergonovine in patients with and without variant angina.	"methylergonovine	49	65	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""methylergonovine"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The effects of intracoronary administration of methylergonovine were studied in 21 patients with variant angina and 22 patients with atypical chest pain and in others without angina pectoris ( control group).	"methylergonovine	47	63	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""methylergonovine"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Methylergonovine was administered continuously at a rate of 10 micrograms / min up to 50 micrograms.	"Methylergonovine	0	16	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Methylergonovine"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In all patients with variant angina, coronary spasm was provoked at a mean dose of 28 + / - 13 micrograms ( mean + / - SD).	[]
In the control group neither ischemic ST change nor localized spasm occurred.	[]
The basal tone of the right coronary artery was significantly lower than that of the left coronary artery.	[]
The percentage of vasoconstriction of the right coronary artery was significantly higher than that of the left coronary artery.	[]
These results suggest that spasm provocation tests, which use an intracoronary injection of a relatively low dose of methylergonovine, have a high sensitivity in variant angina and the vasoreactivity of the right coronary artery may be greater than that of the other coronary arteries.

CASE DESCRIPTION: A 30 - year - old Caucasian woman presented with dental pain, bad breath, and self - reported poor esthetics.	[]
A comprehensive examination including her medical history, panoramic radiograph, and intraoral examination revealed 19 carious lesions, which is not very common for a healthy adult.	[]
She reported her use of methamphetamine for five years and had not experienced any major carious episodes before she started using the drug.	"methamphetamine	24	39	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""methamphetamine"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
"SUMMARY: The patient ' s medical and dental histories along with radiographic and clinical findings lead to a diagnosis of "" meth mouth.

Antituberculosis therapy ( ATT) - associated acute liver failure ( ATT - ALF) is the commonest drug - induced ALF in South Asia.	"Antituberculosis	0	16	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Antituberculosis"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Prospective studies on ATT - ALF are lacking.	[]
The current study prospectively evaluated the magnitude, clinical course, outcome, and prognostic factors in ATT - ALF.	[]
From January 1986 to January 2009, 1223 consecutive ALF patients were evaluated: ATT alone was the cause in 70 ( 5. 7%) patients.	[]
Another 15 ( 1. 2%) had ATT and simultaneous hepatitis virus infection.	[]
In 44 ( 62. 8%) patients, ATT was prescribed empirically without definitive evidence of tuberculosis.	[]
ATT - ALF patients were younger ( 32. 87 [ + / - 15. 8] years), and 49 ( 70%) of them were women.	[]
Most had hyperacute presentation; the median icterus encephalopathy interval was 4. 5 ( 0 - 30) days.	[]
The median duration of ATT before ALF was 30 ( 7 - 350) days.	[]
At presentation, advanced encephalopathy and cerebral edema were present in 51 ( 76%) and 29 ( 41. 4%) patients, respectively.	[]
Gastrointestinal bleed, seizures, infection, and acute renal failure were documented in seven ( 10%), five ( 7. 1%), 26 ( 37. 1%), and seven ( 10%) patients, respectively.	[]
Compared with hepatitis E virus ( HEV) and non - A non - E - induced ALF, ATT - ALF patients had nearly similar presentations except for older age and less elevation of liver enzymes.	[]
The mortality rate among patients with ATT - ALF was high ( 67. 1%, n = 47), and only 23 ( 32. 9%) patients recovered with medical treatment.	[]
In multivariate analysis, three factors independently predicted mortality: serum bilirubin ( > or = 10. 8 mg / dL), prothrombin time ( PT) prolongation ( > or = 26 seconds), and grade III / IV encephalopathy at presentation.	"bilirubin	81	90	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""bilirubin"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
CONCLUSION: ATT - ALF constituted 5. 7% of ALF at our center and had a high mortality rate.	[]
Because the mortality rate is so high, determining which factors are predictors is less important.	[]
A high proportion of patients had consumed ATT empirically, which could have been prevented.	[]
Design and analysis of the HYPREN - trial: safety of enalapril and prazosin in the initial treatment phase of patients with congestive heart failure.

Since the introduction of angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE) inhibitors into the adjunctive treatment of patients with congestive heart failure, cases of severe hypotension, especially on the first day of treatment, have occasionally been reported.	[]
To assess the safety of the ACE inhibitor enalapril a multicenter, randomized, prazosin - controlled trial was designed that compared the incidence and severity of symptomatic hypotension on the first day of treatment.

Subjects were 1210 inpatients with New York Heart Association ( NYHA) functional class II and III.	[]
Patients who received enalapril experienced clinically and statistically significantly less symptomatic hypotension ( 5. 2%) than the patients who received prazosin ( 12. 9%).

Central nervous system complications during treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in a single pediatric institution.	[]
Central nervous system ( CNS) complications during treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL) remain a challenging clinical problem.	[]
Outcome improvement with more intensive chemotherapy has significantly increased the incidence and severity of adverse events.	[]
This study analyzed the incidence of neurological complications during ALL treatment in a single pediatric institution, focusing on clinical, radiological, and electrophysiological findings.	[]
Exclusion criteria included CNS leukemic infiltration at diagnosis, therapy - related peripheral neuropathy, late - onset encephalopathy, or long - term neurocognitive defects.	[]
During a 9 - year period, we retrospectively collected 27 neurological events ( 11%) in as many patients, from 253 children enrolled in the ALL front - line protocol.	[]
CNS complications included posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome ( n = 10), stroke ( n = 5), temporal lobe epilepsy ( n = 2), high - dose methotrexate toxicity ( n = 2), syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion ( n = 1), and other unclassified events ( n = 7).

Nuclear factor kappa B ( NFkappaB) is a sensor of oxidative stress and participates in memory formation that could be involved in drug toxicity and addiction mechanisms.	[]
Therefore NFkappaB activity, oxidative stress, neuronal nitric oxide synthase ( nNOS) activity, spatial learning and memory as well as the effect of topiramate, a previously proposed therapy for cocaine addiction, were evaluated in an experimental model of cocaine administration in rats.

BACKGROUND / AIMS: It is still unclear what happens in the glomerulus when proteinuria starts.	[]
Using puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis ( PAN) rats, we studied early ultrastructural and permeability changes in relation to the expression of the podocyte - associated molecules nephrin, a - actinin, dendrin, and plekhh2, the last two of which were only recently discovered in podocytes.	"puromycin aminonucleoside	6	31	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""puromycin aminonucleoside"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METHODS: Using immune stainings, semiquantitative measurement was performed under the electron microscope.	[]
Permeability was assessed using isolated kidney perfusion with tracers.	[]
Possible effects of ACE inhibition were tested.	[]
RESULTS: By day 2, some patchy foot process effacement, but no proteinuria, appeared.	[]
The amount of nephrin was reduced in both diseased and normal areas.	[]
The other proteins showed few changes, which were limited to diseased areas.	[]
By day 4, foot process effacement was complete and proteinuria appeared in parallel with signs of size barrier damage.	[]
Nephrin decreased further, while dendrin and plekhh2 also decreased but a - actinin remained unchanged.	[]
ACE inhibition had no significant protective effect.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: PAN glomeruli already showed significant pathology by day 4, despite relatively mild proteinuria.	[]
This was preceded by altered nephrin expression, supporting its pivotal role in podocyte morphology.	[]
The novel proteins dendrin and plekhh2 were both reduced, suggesting roles in PAN, whereas a - actinin was unchanged.	[]

MMP - TIMP and ADAM mRNAs were semi - quantitatively analyzed and protein expressions were determined by immunohistochemistry.	[]
RESULTS: Despite similar external diameters among CaCl ( 2) - treated, non - CaCl ( 2) - treated and NaCl - treated segments, aneurymal alteration ( n = 6, 50%), media degeneration with regional disruption, fragmentation of elastic fiber, and increased collagen deposition ( n = 12, 100%) were demonstrated in CaCl ( 2) - treated segments.	"NaCl	101	105	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""NaCl"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
MMP - 2, MMP - 9, ADAM - 10 and ADAM - 17 mRNA levels were increased in CaCl ( 2) - treated segments ( all p < 0. 01), with trends of elevation in CaCl ( 2) - untreated segments, as compared with NaCl - treated segments.	"NaCl	196	200	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""NaCl"", ""start_span"": 196, ""end_span"": 200, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Immunohistochemistry displayed significantly increased expressions of MMP - 2, MMP - 9, ADAM - 10 and ADAM - 17 ( all p < 0. 01) in intima and media for CaCl ( 2) - treated segments.	[]
TIMP mRNA and tissue levels did not differ obviously among the three aortic segments.	[]
CONCLUSION: This study establishes a TAA model by periarterial CaCl ( 2) exposure in rats, and demonstrates a significant elevation of expression of MMP - 2, MMP - 9, ADAM10 and ADAM17 in the pathogenesis of vascular remodeling.	[]

Symptoms such as euphoria, emotional lability and puerile attitude noted in the patient were diagnosed as organic personality syndrome according to the criteria defined in the DSM - III - R.	[]
It is referred to as a frontal lobe syndrome.	[]
Brain CT revealed a periventricular low density area in the frontal white matter and moderate dilatation of the lateral ventricles especially at the bilateral anterior horns.	[]
Consequently, carmofur - induced leukoencephalopathy may uncommonly result in organic personality syndrome in the residual state.	"carmofur	14	22	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""carmofur"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

BACKGROUND: patients undergoing electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT) often receive succinylcholine as part of the anesthetic procedure.	"succinylcholine	79	94	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""succinylcholine"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The duration of action may be prolonged in patients with genetic variants of the butyrylcholinesterase enzyme ( BChE), the most common being the K - and the A - variants.	[]
The aim of the study was to assess the clinical significance of genetic variants in butyrylcholinesterase gene ( BCHE) in patients with a suspected prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine after ECT.	"succinylcholine	180	195	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""succinylcholine"", ""start_span"": 180, ""end_span"": 195, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METHODS: a total of 13 patients were referred to the Danish Cholinesterase Research Unit after ECT during 38 months.	[]
We determined the BChE activity and the BCHE genotype using molecular genetic methods, the duration of apnea, time to sufficient spontaneous ventilation and whether neuromuscular monitoring was used.	[]
The duration of apnea was compared with published data on normal subjects.	[]
RESULTS: in 11 patients, mutations were found in the BCHE gene, the K - variant being the most frequent.	[]
The duration of apnea was 5 - 15 min compared with 3 - 5. 3 min from the literature.	[]
Severe distress was noted in the recovery phase in two patients.	[]
Neuromuscular monitoring was used in two patients.	[]
CONCLUSION: eleven of 13 patients with a prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine had mutations in BCHE, indicating that this is the possible reason for a prolonged period of apnea.

In 24 patients with this complication, the marked slowing of motor nerve conduction velocity and the electromyographic changes imply mainly a demyelinating disorder.	[]
Improvement was noted with cessation of therapy.	[]
In a few cases the presence of active denervation signified a poor prognosis, with only slight improvement.	[]
The underlying mechanism causing the neuropathy is not yet fully known, although some evidence indicates that it may be a lipid storage process.	[]

Cardiac arrhythmias have frequently been reported in association with respiratory failure.	[]
The possible additive role of pharmacologic agents in precipitating cardiac disturbances in patients with respiratory failure has only recently been emphasized.	[]
The effects of aminophylline on the ventricular fibrillation threshold during normal acid - base conditions and during respiratory failure were studied in anesthetized open chest dogs.	"aminophylline	15	28	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""aminophylline"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The ventricular fibrillation threshold was measured by passing a gated train of 12 constant current pulses through the ventricular myocardium during the vulnerable period of the cardiac cycle.	[]
During the infusion of aminophylline, the ventricular fibrillation threshold was reduced by 30 to 40 percent of the control when pH and partial pressures of oxygen ( PO2) and carbon dioxide ( CO2) were kept within normal limits.

When respiratory failure was produced by hypoventilation ( pH 7. 05 to 7. 25; PC02 70 to 100 mm Hg: P02 20 to 40 mm Hg), infusion of aminophylline resulted in an even greater decrease in ventricular fibrillation threshold to 60 percent of the control level.

Cause of death among patients with Parkinson ' s disease: a rare mortality due to cerebral haemorrhage.	[]
Causes of death, with special reference to cerebral haemorrhage, among 240 patients with pathologically verified Parkinson ' s disease were investigated using the Annuals of the Pathological Autopsy Cases in Japan from 1981 to 1985.	[]
The leading causes of death were pneumonia and bronchitis ( 44. 1%), malignant neoplasms ( 11. 6%), heart diseases ( 4. 1%), cerebral infarction ( 3. 7%) and septicaemia ( 3. 3%).	[]

Inhibition of immunoreactive corticotropin - releasing factor secretion into the hypophysial - portal circulation by delayed glucocorticoid feedback.	[]
Nitroprusside - induced hypotension evokes ACTH secretion which is primarily mediated by enhanced secretion of immunoreactive corticotropin - releasing factor ( irCRF) into the hypophysial - portal circulation.	"Nitroprusside	0	13	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Nitroprusside"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Portal plasma concentrations of neither arginine vasopressin nor oxytocin are significantly altered in this paradigm.

Application of a delayed feedback signal, in the form of a 2 - h systemic corticosterone infusion in urethane - anesthetized rats with pharmacological blockade of glucocorticoid synthesis, is without effect on the resting secretion of arginine vasopressin and oxytocin at any corticosterone feedback dose tested.

Resting irCRF levels are suppressed only at the highest corticosterone infusion rate, which resulted in systemic corticosterone levels of 40 micrograms / dl.

Suppression of irCRF secretion in response to nitroprusside - induced hypotension is observed and occurs at a plasma corticosterone level between 8 - 12 micrograms / dl.

In order to elucidate the role of the catecholaminergic system in the cataleptogenic effect of delta 9 - tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC), the effect of pretreatment with 6 - hydroxydopamine ( 6 - OHDA) or with desipramine and 6 - OHDA and lesions of the locus coeruleus were investigated in rats.

On the contrary, the cataleptogenic effect of haloperidol was significantly reduced in rats treated with desipramine and 6 - OHDA but not in rats treated with 6 - OHDA or in rats with lesions of the locus coeruleus.

By November 1984 the Committee on Safety of Medicines had received 82 reports of possible hepatotoxicity associated with the drug, including five deaths.	[]
An analysis of the 75 cases that had been adequately followed up suggested that 16, including three deaths, were probably related to treatment with the drug.	[]
Of the remainder, 48 were possibly related to treatment, five were unlikely to be so, and six were unclassifiable.	[]
The mean age of patients in the 16 probable cases was 57. 9, with hepatotoxicity being more common in women.	[]
The average duration of treatment before the onset of jaundice was 61 days.	[]
None of these well validated cases occurred within the first 10 days after treatment.	[]
The results of serum liver function tests suggested hepatocellular injury in 10 ( 63%); the rest showed a mixed pattern.	[]
In contrast, the results of histological examination of the liver often showed evidence of cholestasis.	[]

The aim of the study was to clarify the incidence and severity of adverse cardiac effects to this treatment.	[]
Before treatment all patients had a cardiac evaluation and during treatment serial ECG recordings were performed.	[]
In the pre - treatment evaluation, signs of cardiovascular disease were found in 33 patients ( 43%).	[]
During treatment, adverse cardiac effects were observed in 14 patients ( 18%).	[]
The mean age of these patients was the same as for the entire group, 64 years.	[]
The incidence of cardiotoxicity was not higher in patients with signs of cardiovascular disease than in those without in the pre - treatment evaluation.	[]
The most common signs of cardiotoxicity were chest pain, ST - T wave changes and atrial fibrillation.	[]
This was followed by ventricular fibrillation in one patient and sudden death in another.	[]
It is concluded that patients on 5 - FU treatment should be under close supervision and that the treatment should be discontinued if chest pain or tachyarrhythmia is observed.

Multiple cytotoxic drug administration is the generally accepted treatment of patients with a high - risk stage of choriocarcinoma.	[]
Based on this principle a 27 - year old woman, classified as being in the high - risk group ( Goldstein and Berkowitz score: 11), was treated with multiple cytotoxic drugs.	[]
The multiple drug schema consisted of: Etoposide 16. 213, Methotrexate, Cyclophosphamide, Actomycin - D, and Cisplatin.

Within 8 hours after initiation of therapy the patient died with a clinical picture resembling massive pulmonary obstruction due to choriocarcinomic tissue plugs, probably originating from the uterus.	[]
Formation of these plugs was probably due to extensive tumor necrosis at the level of the walls of the major uterine veins, which resulted in an open exchange of tumor plugs to the vascular spaces; decrease in tumor tissue coherence secondary to chemotherapy may have further contributed to the formation of tumor emboli.	[]
In view of the close time association between the start of chemotherapy and the acute onset of massive embolism other explanations, such as spontaneous necrosis, must be considered less likely.	[]
Patients with large pelvic tumor loads are, according to existing classifications, at high risk to die and to develop drug resistance.	[]
Notwithstanding these facts our findings suggest that these patients might benefit from relatively mild initial treatment, especially true for patients not previously exposed to this drug.	[]
Close observation of the response status both clinically and with beta - hCG values may indicate whether and when more agressive combination chemotherapy should be started. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	[]

The effects of continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP) on cardiovascular dynamics and pulmonary shunt ( QS / QT) were investigated in 12 dogs before and during sodium nitroprusside infusion that decreased mean arterial blood pressure 40 - 50 per cent.

However, 10 cm H2O CPAP decreased arterial blood pressure, cardiac output, and QS / QT.	"H2O	15	18	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""H2O"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

During nitroprusside infusion low levels of CPAP do not markedly alter cardiovascular dynamics, but high levels of CPAP ( 10 cm H2O), while decreasing QS / QT, produce marked decreases in arterial blood pressure and cardiac output.

The systolic pressure variation ( SPV), which is the difference between the maximal and minimal values of the systolic blood pressure ( SBP) after one positive - pressure breath, was studied in ventilated dogs subjected to hypotension.	[]
Mean arterial pressure was decreased to 50 mm Hg for 30 minutes either by hemorrhage ( HEM, n = 7) or by continuous infusion of sodium nitroprusside ( SNP, n = 7).	"sodium nitroprusside	128	148	Chemical/Drug"	"SNP	151	154	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sodium nitroprusside"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""SNP"", ""start_span"": 151, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
During HEM - induced hypotension the cardiac output was significantly lower and systemic vascular resistance higher compared with that in the SNP group.	"SNP	142	145	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""SNP"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The systemic, central venous, pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and heart rates, were similar in the two groups.	[]
Analysis of the respiratory changes in the arterial pressure waveform enabled differentiation between the two groups.	[]
The SPV during hypotension was 15. 7 + / - 6. 7 mm Hg in the HEM group, compared with 9. 1 + / - 2. 0 mm Hg in the SNP group ( P less than 0. 02).	"SNP	115	118	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""SNP"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The delta down, which is the measure of decrease of SBP after a mechanical breath, was 20. 3 + / - 8. 4 and 10. 1 + / - 3. 8 mm Hg in the HEM and SNP groups, respectively, during hypotension ( P less than 0. 02).	"SNP	146	149	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""SNP"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
It is concluded that increases in the SPV and the delta down are characteristic of a hypotensive state due to a predominant decrease in preload.	[]
They are thus more important during absolute hypovolemia than during deliberate hypotension.	[]

Visual and auditory neurotoxicity was previously documented in 42 of 89 patients with transfusion - dependent anemia who were receiving iron chelation therapy with daily subcutaneous deferoxamine.

Twenty - two patients in the affected group had abnormal audiograms with deficits mostly in the high frequency range of 4, 000 to 8, 000 Hz and in the hearing threshold levels of 30 to 100 decibels.	[]
When deferoxamine therapy was discontinued and serial studies were performed, audiograms in seven cases reverted to normal or near normal within two to three weeks, and nine of 13 patients with symptoms became asymptomatic.

Audiograms from 15 patients remained abnormal and four patients required hearing aids because of permanent disability.	[]
Since 18 of the 22 patients were initially receiving deferoxamine doses in excess of the commonly recommended 50 mg / kg per dose, therapy was restarted with lower doses, usually 50 mg / kg per dose or less depending on the degree of auditory abnormality, and with the exception of two cases no further toxicity was demonstrated.

A dose of 50 mg / kg is recommended in those without audiogram abnormalities.	[]
With mild toxicity, a reduction to 30 or 40 mg / kg per dose should result in a reversal of the abnormal results to normal within four weeks.	[]
Moderate abnormalities require a reduction of deferoxamine to 25 mg / kg per dose with careful monitoring.	"deferoxamine	46	58	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""deferoxamine"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In those with symptoms of hearing loss, the drug should be stopped for four weeks, and when the audiogram is stable or improved, therapy should be restarted at 10 to 25 mg / kg per dose.	[]
Serial audiograms should be performed every six months in those without problems and more frequently in young patients with normal serum ferritin values and in those with auditory dysfunction.	[]

There is a need for a well - defined animal model in which these blood dyscrasias can be studied.	[]
In four subacute toxicity studies, the intravenous administration of cefonicid or cefazedone to beagle dogs caused a dose - dependent incidence of anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia after 1 - 3 months of treatment.	"cefonicid	69	78	Chemical/Drug"	"cefazedone	82	92	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cefonicid"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""cefazedone"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
A nonregenerative anemia was the most compromising of the cytopenias and occurred in approximately 50% of dogs receiving 400 - 500 mg / kg cefonicid or 540 - 840 mg / kg cefazedone.	"cefonicid	139	148	Chemical/Drug"	"cefazedone	170	180	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cefonicid"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""cefazedone"", ""start_span"": 170, ""end_span"": 180, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
All three cytopenias were completely reversible following cessation of treatment; the time required for recovery of the erythron ( approximately 1 month) was considerably longer than that of the granulocytes and platelets ( hours to a few days).	[]
Upon rechallenge with either cephalosporin, the hematologic syndrome was reproduced in most dogs tested; cefonicid ( but not cefazedone) - treated dogs showed a substantially reduced induction period ( 15 + / - 5 days) compared to that of the first exposure to the drug ( 61 + / - 24 days).

This observation, along with the rapid rate of decline in red cell mass parameters of affected dogs, suggests that a hemolytic component complicated the red cell production problem and that multiple toxicologic mechanisms contributed to the cytopenia.	[]
We conclude that the administration of high doses of cefonicid or cefazedone to dogs can induce hematotoxicity similar to the cephalosporin - induced blood dyscrasias described in man and thus provides a useful model for studying the mechanisms of these disorders.

In 24 of these patients chemical cystitis was severe enough for them to drop out of the study.	[]
No systemic side - effects were observed.	[]
Recurrence was studied in 82 evaluable patients after 1 year of follow - up and in 72 patients followed for 2 - 3 years ( mean 32 months).	[]
Of the 82 patients studied after 1 year, 23 had primary and 59 recurrent disease.	[]

Pair fed rats served as controls.	[]
Changes in aortic morphology were examined by light - and transmission - electron microscopy ( TEM).	[]
In addition, the endothelial permeability and the penetration through the aortic wall of albumin were studied 10 minutes, 24 and 48 hours after i. v. injection of human serum 131I - albumin ( 131I - HSA).	[]
TEM revealed extensive elastolysis in the arterial wall of D - pen - treated rats, consistent with an inhibitory effect on crosslink formation.	"D - pen	59	66	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""D - pen"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

The aorta / serum - ratio and the radioactive build - up 24 and 48 hours after injection of 131I - HSA was reduced in animals treated with D - pen for 42 days, indicating an impeded transmural transport of tracer which may be caused by a steric exclusion effect of abundant hyaluronate.

The co - administration of aspirin with N - [ 4 - ( 5 - nitro - 2 - furyl) - 2 - thiazolyl] - formamide ( FANFT) to rats resulted in a reduced incidence of FANFT - induced bladder carcinomas but a concomitant induction of forestomach tumors.

OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to assess the occurrence of hepatic adverse effects encountered with antithyroid drugs.	[]
METHODS: Retrospective review of medical records of 236 patients with hyperthyroidism admitted in our department ( in - or out - patients) from 1986 to 1992.	[]
RESULTS: Four patients ( 1. 7%) were identified with toxic hepatitis which could reasonably be attributed to the use of antithyroid agent.	[]
Two patients had a cholestatic hepatitis induced by carbimazole ( N omercazole).

Biological features of hepatitis disappeared in all cases after cessation of the incriminated drug, while biliary, viral and immunological searches were negative.	[]
Only 2 patients of our retrospective study experienced a mild or severe neutropenia.	[]
CONCLUSION: Toxic hepatitis is a potential adverse effect of antithyroid drugs which warrants, as for haematological disturbances, a pre - therapeutic determination and a careful follow - up of relevant biological markers.	[]
Moreover, hepatotoxicity may not be restricted to one class of antithyroid agents.	[]

Two groups of supine subjects were studied under placebo - controlled conditions, one during the night, when sleeping ( n = 7) and the other at daytime, when awake ( n = 6).	[]
Each subject received a single 50 mg dose of clomipramine given orally 2 hours before blood collection.	"clomipramine	45	57	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""clomipramine"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Plasma PRL concentrations were analysed at 10 min intervals and underlying secretory rates calculated by a deconvolution procedure.	[]
For both experiments the drug intake led to significant increases in PRL secretion, acting preferentially on tonic secretion as pulse amplitude and frequency did not differ significantly from corresponding control values.	[]
During the night clomipramine ingestion altered the complete sleep architecture in that it suppressed REM sleep and the sleep cycles and induced increased wakefulness.	"clomipramine	17	29	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""clomipramine"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
As the relative increase in PRL secretion expressed as a percentage of the mean did not significantly differ between the night and day time studies ( 46 + / - 19% vs 34 + / - 10%), it can be concluded that the observed sleep disturbance did not interfere with the drug action per se.	[]
The presence of REM sleep was shown not to be a determining factor either for secretory pulse amplitude and frequency, as, for both, mean nocturnal values were similar with and without prior clomipramine ingestion.

Patient response was assessed using changes in CD4 + lymphocyte subset count, HIV p24 antigen, weight, and quality of life.	[]
Seventy patients developed major opportunistic infections whilst on therapy; this was the first AIDS diagnosis in 17.	[]
Only minor changes in CD4 + lymphocyte subset count were observed in AIDS patients, although a more significant rise occurred in those with earlier stages of disease.	[]
Of those positive for p24 antigen at the commencement of the study 67% showed a positive response, and this was most likely in those with CD4 + lymphocyte subset counts above 100 mm3.	[]
A positive weight response was seen in 16% of patients.	[]
Most patients showed improvement in individual parameters and global score of quality of life.	[]

Prospective study of the long - term effects of somatostatin analog ( octreotide) on gallbladder function and gallstone formation in Chinese acromegalic patients.	"octreotide	70	80	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""octreotide"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
This article reports the changes in gallbladder function examined by ultrasonography in 20 Chinese patients with active acromegaly treated with sc injection of the somatostatin analog octreotide in dosages of 300 - 1500 micrograms / day for a mean of 24. 2 + / - 13. 9 months.	"octreotide	184	194	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""octreotide"", ""start_span"": 184, ""end_span"": 194, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
During treatment with octreotide, 17 patients developed sludge, 10 had gallstones, and 1 developed acute cholecystitis requiring surgery.	"octreotide	22	32	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""octreotide"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In all of 7 patients examined acutely, gallbladder contractility was inhibited after a single 100 - micrograms injection.	[]
In 8 patients followed for 24 weeks, gallbladder contractility remained depressed throughout therapy.	[]
After withdrawal of octreotide in 10 patients without gallstones, 8 patients assessed had return of normal gallbladder contractility within 1 month.	"octreotide	20	30	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""octreotide"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In 8 of the remaining 10 patients who developed gallstones during treatment, gallbladder contractility normalized in 5 patients ( 3 of whom has disappearance of their stones within 3 weeks), and remained depressed in 3 ( 2 of whom had stones present at 6 months).	[]
Our results suggest that the suppression of gallbladder contractility is the cause of the successive formation of bile sludge, gallstones, and cholecystitis during octreotide therapy in Chinese acromegalic patients.

Habitual use of acetaminophen as a risk factor for chronic renal failure: a comparison with phenacetin.

Six epidemiologic studies in the United States and Europe indicate that habitual use of phenacetin is associated with the development of chronic renal failure and end - stage renal disease ( ESRD), with a relative risk in the range of 4 to 19.	"phenacetin	88	98	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""phenacetin"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
As a result of these and other studies, phenacetin has now been withdrawn from the market in most countries.	"phenacetin	40	50	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""phenacetin"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
However, three case control studies, one each in North Carolina, northern Maryland, and West Berlin, Germany, showed that habitual use of acetaminophen is also associated with chronic renal failure and ESRD, with a relative risk in the range of 2 to 4.	"acetaminophen	138	151	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""acetaminophen"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
These studies suggest that both phenacetin and acetaminophen may contribute to the burden of ESRD, with the risk of the latter being somewhat less than that of the former.	"phenacetin	32	42	Chemical/Drug"	"acetaminophen	47	60	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""phenacetin"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""acetaminophen"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
This apparent difference in risk may not be due to differences in nephrotoxic potential of the drugs themselves.	[]
A lower relative risk would be expected for acetaminophen if the risk of both drugs in combination with other analgesics was higher than the risk of either agent alone.	"acetaminophen	44	57	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""acetaminophen"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Thus, acetaminophen has been used both as a single agent and in combination with other analgesics, whereas phenacetin was available only in combinations.

The majority of anionic sites ( 74% in diabetic and 81% in control rats) were found within the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane.	[]
A minority of anionic sites were scattered throughout the lamina densa and lamina rara interna, and were significantly smaller than those in the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane ( p < 0. 001 and p < 0. 01 for diabetic and control rats, respectively).	[]
Diabetic rats progressively developed albuminuria reaching 40. 3 ( 32. 2 - 62. 0) mg / 24 h after 8 months in contrast to the control animals ( 0. 8 ( 0. 2 - 0. 9) mg / 24 h, p < 0. 002).	[]
At the same time, the number of heparan sulphate anionic sites and the total anionic site surface ( number of anionic sites x mean anionic site surface) in the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane was reduced by 19% ( p < 0. 021) and by 26% ( p < 0. 02), respectively.

Lesions reduced the extent of immunohistological staining for choline acetyltransferase in the interpeduncular nucleus ( p < 0. 025), but not for tyrosine hydroxylase in the surrounding catecholaminergic A10 region.

METHOD: Open, case series design.	[]
RESULTS: We report seven cases where substitution of lithium, either fully or partially, with divalproex sodium was extremely helpful in reducing the cognitive, motivational, or creative deficits attributed to lithium in our bipolar patients.

Alpha and beta coma in drug intoxication uncomplicated by cerebral hypoxia.	[]
Four patients who were rendered comatose or stuporous by drug intoxication, but who were not hypoxic, are described.	[]
Three patients received high doses of chlormethiazole for alcohol withdrawal symptoms, and one took a suicidal overdose of nitrazepam.

All four recovered completely without neurological sequelae following the withdrawal of the offending agents.	[]
The similarities between the effects of structural lesions and pharmacological depression of the brain stem reticular formation are discussed.	[]
It is suggested that in both situations disturbed reticulo - thalamic interactions are important in the pathogenesis of alpha coma.	[]
It is concluded that when this electroencephalographic and behavioural picture is seen in drug intoxication, in the absence of significant hypoxaemia, a favourable outcome may be anticipated.	[]
Magnetic resonance volumetry of the cerebellum in epileptic patients after phenytoin overdosages.	"phenytoin	75	84	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""phenytoin"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between phenytoin medication and cerebellar atrophy in patients who had experienced clinical intoxication.	"phenytoin	63	72	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""phenytoin"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Five females and 6 males, 21 - 59 years of age, were examined with a 1. 5 - T whole - body system using a circular polarized head coil.	[]
Conventional spin echo images were acquired in the sagittal and transverse orientation.	[]
In addition, we performed a high - resolution 3D gradient echo, T1 - weighted sequences at a 1 - mm slice thickness.	[]
The images were subsequently processed to obtain volumetric data for the cerebellum.	[]
Cerebellar volume for the patient group ranged between 67. 66 and 131. 08 ml ( mean 108. 9 ml).	[]
In addition 3D gradient echo data sets from 10 healthy male and 10 healthy female age - matched volunteers were used to compare cerebellar volumes.	[]
Using linear regression we found that no correlation exists between seizure duration, elevation of phenytoin serum levels and cerebellar volume.	"phenytoin	99	108	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""phenytoin"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
However, multiple regression for the daily dosage, duration of phenytoin treatment and cerebellar volume revealed a correlation of these parameters.	"phenytoin	63	72	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""phenytoin"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We conclude that phenytoin overdosage does not necessarily result in cerebellar atrophy and it is unlikely that phenytoin medication was the only cause of cerebellar atrophy in the remaining patients.

This case emphasizes the possibility that HUS in adults is not invariably irreversible and that, despite prolonged oliguria, recovery of renal function can be obtained.	[]
Therefore, in adult patients affected by HUS, dialysis should not be discontinued prematurely; moreover, bilateral nephrectomy, for treatment of severe hypertension and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, should be performed with caution.	[]

The first ultrastructural changes in structural elements of the blood - brain - barrier ( BBB) in the cerebellar cortex were detectable after 3 months of the experiment.	[]
They became more severe in the later months of the experiment, and were most severe after 12 months, located mainly in the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex.	[]
Lesions of the capillary included necrosis of endothelial cells.	[]
Organelles of these cells, in particular the mitochondria ( increased number and size, distinct degeneration of their matrix and cristae) and Golgi apparatus were altered.	[]
Reduced size of capillary lumen and occlusion were caused by swollen endothelial cells which had luminal protrusions and swollen microvilli.	"luminal	97	104	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""luminal"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Pressure on the vessel wall was produced by enlarged perivascular astrocytic processes.	[]
Fragments of necrotic endothelial cells were in the vascular lumens and in these there was loosening and breaking of tight cellular junctions.	[]
Damage to the vascular basement lamina was also observed.	[]
Damage to the capillary was accompanied by marked damage to neuroglial cells, mainly to perivascular processes of astrocytes.	[]
The proliferation of astrocytes ( Bergmann ' s in particular) and occasionally of oligodendrocytes was found.	[]
Alterations in the structural elements of the BBB coexisted with marked lesions of neurons of the cerebellum ( Purkinje cells are earliest).	[]
In electron micrographs both luminal and antiluminal sides of the BBB of the cerebellar cortex had similar lesions.	"luminal	29	36	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""luminal"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Risk factors of sensorineural hearing loss in preterm infants.	[]
Among 547 preterm infants of < or = 34 weeks gestation born between 1987 and 1991, 8 children ( 1. 46%) developed severe progressive and bilateral sensorineural hearing loss.	[]
Perinatal risk factors of infants with hearing loss were compared with those of two control groups matched for gestation and birth weight and for perinatal complications.	[]
Our observations demonstrated an association of hearing loss with a higher incidence of perinatal complications.	[]
Ototoxicity appeared closely related to a prolonged administration and higher total dose of ototoxic drugs, particularly aminoglycosides and furosemide.

The patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups; those in group A ( n = 10) were subjected to controlled hypotension alone, those in group B ( n = 10) to haemodilution alone and those in group C ( n = 10) to both controlled hypotension and haemodilution.	[]
Haemodilution in groups B and C was produced by withdrawing approximately 1000 mL of blood and replacing it with the same amount of dextran solution, and final haematocrit values were 21 or 22%.

AKBR and biological hepatic function tests showed no change throughout the time course in groups A and B.	[]
In group C, AKBR showed a significant decrease at 120 min ( - 40%) and at 180 min ( - 49%) after the start of hypotension and at 60 min ( - 32%) after recovery of normotension, and SGOT, SGPT, LDH and total bilirubin showed significant increases after operation.

The role of nicotine in smoking - related cardiovascular disease.	"nicotine	12	20	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""nicotine"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Nicotine activates the sympathetic nervous system and in this way could contribute to cardiovascular disease.	"Nicotine	0	8	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Nicotine"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Animal studies and mechanistic studies indicate that nicotine could play a role in accelerating atherosclerosis, but evidence among humans is too inadequate to be definitive about such an effect.

Almost certainly, nicotine via its hemodynamic effects contributes to acute cardiovascular events, although current evidence suggests that the effects of nicotine are much less important than are the prothrombotic effects of cigarette smoking or the effects of carbon monoxide.

Most of the other low testosterone levels seemed to result from nonorganic hypothalamic dysfunction because of normal serum luteinizing hormone and prolactin and to have only a small role in erectile dysfunction ( definite improvement in only 16 of 44 [ 36%] after androgen therapy, normal morning or nocturnal erections in 30% and definite vasculogenic contributions in 42%).

CONCLUSIONS: Low prevalences and effects of low testosterone and high prolactin in erectile dysfunction cannot justify their routine determination.	"testosterone	48	60	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""testosterone"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
However, cost - effective screening strategies recommended so far missed 40 to 50% of cases improved with endocrine therapy and the pituitary tumors.	[]
We now advocate that before age 50 years testosterone be determined only in cases of low sexual desire and abnormal physical examination but that it be measured in all men older than 50 years.

To determine if routine risperidone treatment is associated with a unique degree of D2 receptor occupancy and pattern of clinical effects, we used [ 123I] IBZM SPECT to determine D2 occupancy in subjects treated with routine clinical doses of risperidone ( n = 12) or haloperidol ( n = 7).

The effect of different anaesthetic agents in hearing loss following spinal anaesthesia.	[]
The cause of hearing loss after spinal anaesthesia is unknown.	[]

The aim of this study was to describe this hearing loss and to investigate other factors influencing the degree of hearing loss.	[]

The surgery and anaesthesia were uneventful, but 3 days after surgery, the patient reported an area of hypoaesthesia over L3 - L4 dermatomes of the leg which had been operated on ( loss of pinprick sensation) without reduction in muscular strength.	[]
Sensation in this area returned to normal over the following 2 weeks.	[]
Prospective multicentre studies with a large population and a long follow - up should be performed in order to evaluate the incidence of this unusual side effect.	[]
However, we suggest that a low solution concentration should be preferred for unilateral spinal anaesthesia with a hyperbaric anaesthetic solution ( if pencil - point needle and slow injection rate are employed), in order to minimize the risk of a localized high peak anaesthetic concentration, which might lead to a transient neurological deficit.

Transient neurologic symptoms after spinal anesthesia: a lower incidence with prilocaine and bupivacaine than with lidocaine.

BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that transient neurologic symptoms ( TNSs) frequently follow lidocaine spinal anesthesia but are infrequent with bupivacaine.

However, identification of a short - acting local anesthetic to substitute for lidocaine for brief surgical procedures remains an important goal.	"lidocaine	79	88	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""lidocaine"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Prilocaine is an amide local anesthetic with a duration of action similar to that of lidocaine.

Accordingly, the present, prospective double - blind study compares prilocaine with lidocaine and bupivacaine with respect to duration of action and relative risk of TNSs.

Details of spinal puncture, extension and regression of spinal block, and the times to reach discharge criteria were noted.	[]
In the evening of postoperative day 1, patients were evaluated for TNSs by a physician unaware of the drug administered and the details of the anesthetic procedure.	[]
RESULTS: Nine of 30 patients receiving lidocaine experienced TNSs, 1 of 30 patients receiving prilocaine ( P = 0. 03) had them, and none of 30 patients receiving bupivacaine had TNSs.

Times to ambulate and to void were similar after lidocaine and prilocaine ( 150 vs. 165 min and 238 vs. 253 min, respectively) but prolonged after bupivacaine ( 200 and 299 min, respectively; P < 0. 05).

Adverse effects of the atypical antipsychotics.	[]
Collaborative Working Group on Clinical Trial Evaluations.	[]
Adverse effects of antipsychotics often lead to noncompliance.	[]
Thus, clinicians should address patients ' concerns about adverse effects and attempt to choose medications that will improve their patients ' quality of life as well as overall health.	[]
The side effect profiles of the atypical antipsychotics are more advantageous than those of the conventional neuroleptics.	[]
Conventional agents are associated with unwanted central nervous system effects, including extrapyramidal symptoms ( EPS), tardive dyskinesia, sedation, and possible impairment of some cognitive measures, as well as cardiac effects, orthostatic hypotension, hepatic changes, anticholinergic side effects, sexual dysfunction, and weight gain.	[]
The newer atypical agents have a lower risk of EPS, but are associated in varying degrees with sedation, cardiovascular effects, anticholinergic effects, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, hepatic effects, lowered seizure threshold ( primarily clozapine), and agranulocytosis ( clozapine only).	"clozapine	242	251	Chemical/Drug"	"clozapine	242	251	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""clozapine"", ""start_span"": 242, ""end_span"": 251, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""clozapine"", ""start_span"": 242, ""end_span"": 251, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Since the incidence and severity of specific adverse effects differ among the various atypicals, the clinician should carefully consider which side effects are most likely to lead to the individual ' s dissatisfaction and noncompliance before choosing an antipsychotic for a particular patient.	[]

"haloperidol	95	106	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""haloperidol"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METHOD: In a 6 - week random - assignment, double - blind, placebo - controlled trial ( phase A), haloperidol, 2 - 3 mg / day ( standard dose), and haloperidol, 0. 50 - 0. 75 mg / day ( low dose), were compared in 71 outpatients with Alzheimer ' s disease.

RESULTS: For the 60 patients who completed phase A, standard - dose haloperidol was efficacious and superior to both low - dose haloperidol and placebo for scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale psychosis factor and on psychomotor agitation.

Response rates according to three sets of criteria were greater with the standard dose ( 55% - 60%) than the low dose ( 25% - 35%) and placebo ( 25% - 30%).	[]
The advantage of standard dose over low dose was replicated in phase B.	[]
In phase A, extrapyramidal signs tended to be greater with the standard dose than in the other two conditions, primarily because of a subgroup ( 20%) who developed moderate to severe signs.	[]
Low - dose haloperidol did not differ from placebo on any measure of efficacy or side effects.	"haloperidol	11	22	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""haloperidol"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated a favorable therapeutic profile for haloperidol in doses of 2 - 3 mg / day, although a subgroup developed moderate to severe extrapyramidal signs.	"haloperidol	71	82	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""haloperidol"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

BACKGROUND: We clinically and pathologically analyzed renal allografts from 1 9 renal transplant patients treated with tacrolimus ( FK506) for more than 1 year.

METHODS: Twenty - six renal allograft biopsy specimens from 1 9 renal transplant patients who underwent transplantations between 1991 and 1993 were evaluated.	[]
Thirteen biopsies were performed from stable functioning renal allografts with informed consent ( nonepisode biopsy) and the other 13 were from dysfunctional renal allografts with a clinical indication for biopsy ( episode biopsy).	[]
RESULTS: The main pathologic diagnoses ( some overlap) were acute rejection ( AR; n = 4), chronic rejection ( CR; n = 5), AR + CR ( n = 4), recurrent IgA nephropathy ( n = 5), normal findings ( n = 2), minimal - type chronic FK506 nephropathy ( n = 9), and mild - type FK506 nephropathy ( n = 11).

Of the nonepisode biopsies, 7 and 4 biopsies showed minimal - type and mild - type chronic FK506 nephropathy, respectively.	"FK506	91	96	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""FK506"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Chronic FK506 nephropathy consisted of rough and foamy tubular vacuolization ( 5 biopsies), arteriolopathy ( angiodegeneration of the arteriolar wall; 20 biopsies), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( 4 biopsies) and the striped form of interstitial fibrosis ( 11 biopsies).	"FK506	8	13	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""FK506"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The serum creatinine levels of patients in the mild - type chronic FK506 nephropathy group, which included 7 episode biopsies, were statistically higher than those in the minimum - type chronic FK506 - nephropathy group ( P < 0. 001).

CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that chronic FK506 nephropathy consists primarily of arteriolopathy manifesting as insudative hyalinosis of the arteriolar wall, and suggests that mild - type chronic FK506 nephropathy is a condition which may lead to deterioration of renal allograft function.

Different lobular distributions of altered hepatocyte tight junctions in rat models of intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholestasis.	[]
Hepatocyte tight junctions ( TJs), the only intercellular barrier between the sinusoidal and the canalicular spaces, play a key role in bile formation.	[]
Although hepatocyte TJs are impaired in cholestasis, attempts to localize the precise site of hepatocyte TJ damage by freeze - fracture electron microscopy have produced limited information.	[]
Recently, several TJ - associated proteins like ZO - 1 and 7H6 have been identified and characterized.	[]
Immunolocalization of 7H6 appears to closely correlate with paracellular permeability.	[]
We used rat models of intrahepatic cholestasis by ethinyl estradiol ( EE) treatment and extrahepatic cholestasis by bile duct ligation ( BDL) to precisely determine the site of TJ damage.	"ethinyl estradiol	50	67	Chemical/Drug"	"EE	70	72	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ethinyl estradiol"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""EE"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Alterations in hepatocyte TJs were assessed by double - immunolabeling for 7H6 and ZO - 1 using a confocal laser scanning microscope.	[]
In control rats, immunostaining for 7H6 and ZO - 1 colocalized to outline bile canaliculi in a continuous fashion.	[]
In contrast, 7H6 and ZO - 1 immunostaining was more discontinuous, outlining the bile canaliculi after BDL.	[]
Immunostaining for 7H6, not ZO - 1, decreased and predominantly appeared as discrete signals in the submembranous cytoplasm of periportal hepatocytes after BDL.	[]
After EE treatment, changes in immunostaining for 7H6 and ZO - 1 were similar to those seen in periportal hepatocytes after BDL, but distributed more diffusely throughout the lobule.	"EE	6	8	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""EE"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Thereafter, the treatment modalities for a subset of animals were crossed over for an additional eight months.	[]
Biochemical and hormonal indices of calcium and bone metabolism were measured throughout the study, and bone biopsies were done at baseline, 60 weeks after OCT or vehicle treatment, and at the end of the crossover period.

RESULTS: In Nx dogs, OCT significantly decreased serum PTH levels soon after the induction of renal insufficiency.	"OCT	21	24	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""OCT"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In long - standing secondary hyperparathyroidism, OCT ( 0. 03 microg / kg) stabilized serum PTH levels during the first months.	"OCT	50	53	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""OCT"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Serum PTH levels rose thereafter, but the rise was less pronounced compared with baseline than the rise seen in Nx control.	[]
These effects were accompanied by episodes of hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia.	[]
In animals with normal renal function, OCT induced a transient decrease in serum PTH levels at a dose of 0. 1 microg / kg, which was not sustained with lowering of the doses.	"OCT	39	42	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""OCT"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that even though OCT does not completely prevent the occurrence of hypercalcemia in experimental dogs with renal insufficiency, it may be of use in the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism because it does not induce low bone turnover and, therefore, does not increase the risk of adynamic bone disease.

The morphological appearance of the kidneys was examined on days three, four, six, eight and thirty three and the NAG isoenzyme patterns on days zero, four, eight and thirty three.	[]
RESULTS: Following intravenous PAN urine volume and urine NAG activity increased significantly by day two, but returned to normal by day four.	"PAN	31	34	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""PAN"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
After day four all treated animals exhibited a marked rise in urine albumin, total protein excretion and NAG activity.	[]
Electrophoresis showed a generalised increase in middle and high molecular weight urine proteins from day four onwards.	[]
Protein droplets first appeared prominent in tubular cells on day four.	[]
Peak urine NAG activity and a change in NAG isoenzyme pattern coincided with both the peak proteinuria and the reduction in intracellular protein and NAG droplets ( day six onwards).	[]
CONCLUSIONS: This animal model demonstrates that an increase in lysosomal turnover and hence urine NAG activity, occurs when increased protein is presented to the tubular cells.	[]
Urine NAG activity is thus a measure of altered function in the renal tubules and not simply an indicator of damage.	[]

Six cases of cauda equina syndrome with varying severity were reported to the Swedish Pharmaceutical Insurance during the period 1993 - 1997.	[]
All were associated with spinal anaesthesia using hyperbaric 5% lignocaine.	"lignocaine	64	74	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""lignocaine"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Five cases had single - shot spinal anaesthesia and one had a repeat spinal anaesthetic due to inadequate block.	[]
The dose of hyperbaric 5% lignocaine administered ranged from 60 to 120 mg.	"lignocaine	26	36	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""lignocaine"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Three of the cases were most likely caused by direct neurotoxicity of hyperbaric 5% lignocaine.	"lignocaine	84	94	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""lignocaine"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In the other 3 cases, direct neurotoxicity was also probable, but unfortunately radiological investigations were not done to definitely exclude a compressive aetiology.	[]
All cases sustained permanent neurological deficits.	[]
We recommend that hyperbaric lignocaine should be administered in concentrations not greater than 2% and at a total dose preferably not exceeding 60 mg.	"lignocaine	29	39	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""lignocaine"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Systemic toxicity following administration of sirolimus ( formerly rapamycin) for psoriasis: association of capillary leak syndrome with apoptosis of lesional lymphocytes.

BACKGROUND: Sirolimus ( formerly rapamycin) is an immunosuppressive agent that interferes with T - cell activation.	"Sirolimus	12	21	Chemical/Drug"	"rapamycin	33	42	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Sirolimus"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""rapamycin"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
After 2 individuals with psoriasis developed a capillary leak syndrome following treatment with oral sirolimus lesional skin cells and activated peripheral blood cells were analyzed for induction of apoptosis.	"sirolimus	101	110	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sirolimus"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
OBSERVATIONS: A keratome skin specimen from 1 patient with sirolimus - induced capillary leak syndrome had a 2. 3 - fold increase in percentage of apoptotic cells ( to 48%) compared with an unaffected sirolimus - treated patient with psoriasis ( 21%).	"sirolimus	59	68	Chemical/Drug"	"sirolimus	59	68	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sirolimus"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""sirolimus"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Activated peripheral blood T cells from patients with psoriasis tended to exhibit greater spontaneous or dexamethasone - induced apoptosis than did normal T cells, particularly in the presence of sirolimus.	"dexamethasone	105	118	Chemical/Drug"	"sirolimus	196	205	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dexamethasone"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""sirolimus"", ""start_span"": 196, ""end_span"": 205, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
CONCLUSIONS: Severe adverse effects of sirolimus include fever, anemia, and capillary leak syndrome.	"sirolimus	39	48	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""sirolimus"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
These symptoms may be the result of drug - induced apoptosis of lesional leukocytes, especially activated T lymphocytes, and possibly release of inflammatory mediators.	[]
Because patients with severe psoriasis may develop capillary leak from various systemic therapies, clinical monitoring is advisable for patients with inflammatory diseases who are treated with immune modulators.	[]
Effect of lithium maintenance therapy on thyroid and parathyroid function.	"lithium	10	17	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""lithium"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
OBJECTIVES: To assess changes induced by lithium maintenance therapy on the incidence of thyroid, parathyroid and ion alterations.	"lithium	41	48	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""lithium"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
These were evaluated with respect to the duration of lithium therapy, age, sex, and family history ( whether or not the patient had a first - degree relative with thyroid disease).	"lithium	53	60	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""lithium"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
DESIGN: Prospective study.	[]
SETTING: Affective Disorders Clinic at St.	[]
Mary ' s Hospital, Montreal.	[]
PATIENTS: One hundred and one patients ( 28 men and 73 women) with bipolar disorder receiving lithium maintenance therapy ranging from 1 year ' s to 32 years ' duration.	"lithium	94	101	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""lithium"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The control group consisted of 82 patients with no psychiatric or endocrinological diagnoses from the hospital ' s out - patient clinics.	[]
OUTCOME MEASURES: Laboratory analyses of calcium, magnesium and thyroid - stimulating hormone levels performed before beginning lithium therapy and at biannual follow - up.	"calcium	41	48	Chemical/Drug"	"magnesium	50	59	Chemical/Drug"	"lithium	128	135	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""calcium"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""magnesium"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""lithium"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
RESULTS: Hypothyroidism developed in 40 patients, excluding 8 patients who were hypothyroid at baseline.	[]
All patients having first - degree relatives affected by thyroid illness had accelerated onset of hypothyroidism ( 3. 7 years after onset of lithium therapy) compared with patients without a family history ( 8. 6 years after onset of lithium therapy).	"lithium	141	148	Chemical/Drug"	"lithium	141	148	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""lithium"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""lithium"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Women over 60 years of age were more often affected by hypothyroidism than women under 60 years of age ( 34. 6% versus 31. 9%).	[]
Magnesium levels in patients on lithium treatment were unchanged from baseline levels.	"Magnesium	0	9	Chemical/Drug"	"lithium	32	39	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Magnesium"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""lithium"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
After lithium treatment, calcium levels were higher than either baseline levels or control levels.

Eight of these cases of severe immune hemolytic anemia are described.	[]
Effects of nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs on hemostasis in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.	[]
Platelet function is impaired by nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) with prominent anti - inflammatory properties.	[]
Their safety in patients undergoing intracranial surgery is under debate.	[]
Patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH) were randomized to receive either ketoprofen, 100 mg, three times a day ( ketoprofen group, n = 9) or a weak NSAID, acetaminophen, 1 g, three times a day ( acetaminophen group, n = 9) starting immediately after the diagnosis of aneurysmal SAH.

Treatment was continued for 3 days postoperatively.	[]
Test blood samples were taken before treatment and surgery as well as on the first, third, and fifth postoperative mornings.	[]
Maximal platelet aggregation induced by 6 microM of adenosine diphosphate decreased after administration of ketoprofen.

Aggregation was lower ( P <. 05) in the ketoprofen group than in the acetaminophen group just before surgery and on the third postoperative day.	"ketoprofen	40	50	Chemical/Drug"	"acetaminophen	69	82	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ketoprofen"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""acetaminophen"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In contrast, maximal platelet aggregation increased in the acetaminophen group on the third postoperative day as compared with the pretreatment platelet aggregation results ( P <. 05).	"acetaminophen	59	72	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""acetaminophen"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Coagulation ( prothrombin time [ PT], activated partial thromboplastin time [ APPT], fibrinogen concentration, and antithrombin III [ AT III]) was comparable between the two groups.	[]
Ketoprofen but not acetaminophen impaired platelet function in patients with SAH.

We recently showed elevated reactive oxygen species ( ROS), reduced urinary excretion of NO metabolites ( NOx), and increased NO sequestration as nitrotyrosine in various tissues in rats with lead - induced hypertension.	"oxygen	37	43	Chemical/Drug"	"NO	89	91	Chemical/Drug"	"NO	89	91	Chemical/Drug"	"nitrotyrosine	146	159	Chemical/Drug"	"lead	192	196	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""oxygen"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""NO"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""NO"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""nitrotyrosine"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 159, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""lead"", ""start_span"": 192, ""end_span"": 196, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
This study was designed to discern whether the reduction in urinary NOx in lead - induced hypertension is, in part, due to depressed NO synthase ( NOS) expression.	"lead	75	79	Chemical/Drug"	"NO	68	70	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""lead"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""NO"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Male Sprague - Dawley rats were randomly assigned to a lead - treated group ( given lead acetate, 100 ppm, in drinking water and regular rat chow), a group given lead and vitamin E - fortified chow, or a normal control group given either regular food and water or vitamin E - fortified food for 12 weeks.

Tail blood pressure, urinary NOx excretion, plasma malondialdehyde ( MDA), and endothelial and inducible NOS ( eNOS and iNOS) isotypes in the aorta and kidney were measured.	"malondialdehyde	51	66	Chemical/Drug"	"MDA	69	72	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""malondialdehyde"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""MDA"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The lead - treated group exhibited a rise in blood pressure and plasma MDA concentration, a fall in urinary NOx excretion, and a paradoxical rise in vascular and renal tissue eNOS and iNOS expression.	"lead	4	8	Chemical/Drug"	"MDA	71	74	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""lead"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""MDA"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Vitamin E supplementation ameliorated hypertension, lowered plasma MDA concentration, and raised urinary NOx excretion while significantly lowering vascular, but not renal, tissue eNOS and iNOS expression.	"Vitamin E	0	9	Chemical/Drug"	"MDA	67	70	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Vitamin E"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""MDA"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Vitamin E supplementation had no effect on either blood pressure, plasma MDA, or NOS expression in the control group.

The study also revealed significant inhibition of NOS enzymatic activity by lead in cell - free preparations.	"lead	76	80	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""lead"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In conclusion, lead - induced hypertension in this model was associated with a compensatory upregulation of renal and vascular eNOS and iNOS expression.	"lead	15	19	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""lead"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
This is, in part, due to ROS - mediated NO inactivation, lead - associated inhibition of NOS activity, and perhaps stimulatory actions of increased shear stress associated with hypertension.

Glyceryl trinitrate induces attacks of migraine without aura in sufferers of migraine with aura.	"Glyceryl trinitrate	0	19	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Glyceryl trinitrate"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Migraine with aura and migraine without aura have the same pain phase, thus indicating that migraine with aura and migraine without aura share a common pathway of nociception.	[]
In recent years, increasing evidence has suggested that the messenger molecule nitric oxide ( NO) is involved in pain mechanisms of migraine without aura.	"nitric oxide	79	91	Chemical/Drug"	"NO	94	96	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""nitric oxide"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""NO"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In order to clarify whether the same is true for migraine with aura, in the present study we examined the headache response to intravenous infusion of glyceryl trinitrate ( GTN) ( 0. 5 microg / kg / min for 20 min) in 12 sufferers of migraine with aura.	"glyceryl trinitrate	151	170	Chemical/Drug"	"GTN	173	176	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""glyceryl trinitrate"", ""start_span"": 151, ""end_span"": 170, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""GTN"", ""start_span"": 173, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The specific aim was to elucidate whether an aura and / or an attack of migraine without aura could be induced.	[]
Fourteen healthy subjects served as controls.	[]
Aura symptoms were not elicited in any subject.	[]
Headache was more severe in migraineurs than in the controls during and immediately after GTN infusion ( p = 0. 037) as well as during the following 11 h ( p = 0. 008).	"GTN	90	93	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""GTN"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In the controls, the GTN - induced headache gradually disappeared, whereas in migraineurs peak headache intensity occurred at a mean time of 240 min post - infusion.	"GTN	21	24	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""GTN"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
At this time the induced headache in 6 of 12 migraineurs fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for migraine without aura of the International Headache Society.	[]
The results therefore suggest that NO is involved in the pain mechanisms of migraine with aura.	"NO	35	37	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""NO"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Since cortical spreading depression has been shown to liberate NO in animals, this finding may help our understanding of the coupling between cortical spreading depression and headache in migraine with aura.

Ocular manifestations of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.	[]
We followed 210 cases of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis closely for eleven years.	[]
Thirty - six of the 210 patients ( 17. 2%) developed iridocyclitis.	[]
Iridocyclitis was seen most frequently in young female patients ( 0 to 4 years) with the monoarticular or pauciatricular form of the arthritis.	[]
However, 30% of the patients developed uveitis after 16 years of age.	[]
Although 61% of patients had a noncontributory ocular history on entry, 42% had active uveitis on entry.	[]
Our approach was effective in detecting uveitis in new cases and exacerbations of uveitis in established cases.	[]
Forty - four percent of patients with uveitis had one or more identifiable signs or symptoms, such as red eye, ocular pain, decreased visual acuity, or photophobia, in order of decreasing frequency.	[]
Even after early detection and prompt treatment, 41% of cases of uveitis did not respond to more than six months of intensive topical treatment with corticosteroids and mydriatics.

PURPOSE: To develop a model of visceral pain in rats using a behavioral approach.	[]
Cyclophosphamide ( CP), an antitumoral agent known to produce toxic effects on the bladder wall through its main toxic metabolite acrolein, was used to induce cystitis.

All eye drops were given in a randomized order.	[]
In 2 separate sessions, a single dose of scopolamine ( 0. 5 mg, intravenously) or placebo was administered, and the effects on word recall were measured using the Buschke Selective Reminding Test over 2 hours.	"scopolamine	41	52	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""scopolamine"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
OUTCOME MEASURES: Pupil size at time points after administration of tropicamide and pilocarpine; scopolamine - induced impairment in word recall.

RESULTS: There was no significant difference between elderly and young volunteers in pupillary response to tropicamide at any time point ( p > 0. 05).	"tropicamide	107	118	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""tropicamide"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The elderly group had a significantly greater pilocarpine - induced net decrease in pupil size 85, 125, 165 and 215 minutes after administration, compared with the young group ( p < 0. 05).	"pilocarpine	46	57	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""pilocarpine"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Compared with the young group, the elderly group had greater scopolamine - induced impairment in word recall 60, 90 and 120 minutes after administration ( p < 0. 05).	"scopolamine	61	72	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""scopolamine"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
CONCLUSION: There is an age - related pupillary response to pilocarpine that is not found with tropicamide.

Thus, pilocarpine may be useful to assess variations in central cholinergic function in elderly patients.	"pilocarpine	6	17	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""pilocarpine"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Pain responses in methadone - maintained opioid abusers.	"methadone	18	27	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""methadone"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Providing pain management for known opioid abusers is a challenging clinical task, in part because little is known about their pain experience and analgesic requirements.	[]
This study was designed to describe pain tolerance and analgesic response in a sample of opioid addicts stabilized in methadone - maintenance ( MM) treatment ( n = 60) in comparison to matched nondependent control subjects ( n = 60).	"methadone	118	127	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""methadone"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
By using a placebo - controlled, two - way factorial design, tolerance to cold - pressor ( CP) pain was examined, both before and after oral administration of therapeutic doses of common opioid ( hydromorphone 2 mg) and nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory ( ketorolac 10 mg) analgesic agents.	"hydromorphone	196	209	Chemical/Drug"	"ketorolac	255	264	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""hydromorphone"", ""start_span"": 196, ""end_span"": 209, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""ketorolac"", ""start_span"": 255, ""end_span"": 264, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Results showed that MM individuals were significantly less tolerant of CP pain than control subjects, replicating previous work.	[]
Analgesic effects were significant neither for medication nor group.	[]
These data indicate that MM opioid abusers represent a pain - intolerant subset of clinical patients.	[]
Their complaints of pain should be evaluated seriously and managed aggressively.	[]
High - dose methylprednisolone may do more harm for spinal cord injury.	"methylprednisolone	12	30	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""methylprednisolone"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Because of the National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Studies ( NASCIS), high - dose methylprednisolone became the standard of care for the acute spinal cord injury.	"methylprednisolone	80	98	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""methylprednisolone"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In the NASCIS, there was no mention regarding the possibility of acute corticosteroid myopathy that high - dose methylprednisolone may cause.

The dosage of methylprednisolone recommended by the NASCIS 3 is the highest dose of steroids ever being used during a 2 - day period for any clinical condition.

We hypothesize that it may cause some damage to the muscle of spinal cord injury patients.	[]
Further, steroid myopathy recovers naturally and the neurological improvement shown in the NASCIS may be just a recording of this natural motor recovery from the steroid myopathy, instead of any protection that methylprednisolone offers to the spinal cord injury.

METHODS: Twenty renal transplant recipients were switched to fixed dose rapamycin ( RAPA) ( 5 mg / day) 0 to 204 months posttransplant.	"rapamycin	72	81	Chemical/Drug"	"RAPA	84	88	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""rapamycin"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""RAPA"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Drug monitoring was not initially used to adjust doses.	[]
The indications for switch were chronic CsA or Tac nephrotoxicity ( 12), acute CsA or Tac toxicity ( 3), severe facial dysmorphism ( 2), posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder ( PTLD) in remission ( 2), and hepatotoxicity in 1.

Follow - up is 7 to 24 months.	[]
RESULTS: In the 12 patients switched because of chronic nephrotoxicity there was a significant decrease in serum creatinine [ 233 + / - 34 to 210 + / - 56 micromol / liter ( P < 0. 05) at 6 months].	"creatinine	113	123	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""creatinine"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Facial dysmorphism improved in two patients.	[]
No relapse of PTLD was observed.	[]
Five patients developed pneumonia ( two Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, one infectious mononucleosis with polyclonal PTLD lung infiltrate) and two had bronchiolitis obliterans.	[]
There were no deaths.	[]
RAPA was discontinued in four patients, because of pneumonia in two, PTLD in one, and oral aphtous ulcers in one.	"RAPA	0	4	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""RAPA"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
RAPA levels were high ( > 15 ng / ml) in 7 of 13 ( 54%) patients.	"RAPA	0	4	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""RAPA"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
CONCLUSIONS: RAPA conversion provides adequate immunosuppression to enable CsA withdrawal.

"vigabatrin	122	132	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""vigabatrin"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
PURPOSE: Symptomatic visual field constriction thought to be associated with vigabatrin has been reported.	"vigabatrin	77	87	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""vigabatrin"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The current study investigated the visual fields and visual electrophysiology of eight patients with known vigabatrin - attributed visual field loss, three of whom were reported previously.	"vigabatrin	107	117	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""vigabatrin"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Six of the patients were no longer receiving vigabatrin.	"vigabatrin	45	55	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""vigabatrin"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METHODS: The central and peripheral fields were examined with the Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer.	[]
Full visual electrophysiology, including flash electroretinography ( ERG), pattern electroretinography, multifocal ERG using the VERIS system, electro - oculography, and flash and pattern visual evoked potentials, was undertaken.	[]
RESULTS: Seven patients showed marked visual field constriction with some sparing of the temporal visual field.	[]
The eighth exhibited concentric constriction.	[]
Most electrophysiological responses were usually just within normal limits; two patients had subnormal Arden electro - oculography indices; and one patient showed an abnormally delayed photopic b wave.	[]
However, five patients showed delayed 30 - Hz flicker b waves, and seven patients showed delayed oscillatory potentials.	[]
Multifocal ERG showed abnormalities that sometimes correlated with the visual field appearance and confirmed that the deficit occurs at the retinal level.	[]
CONCLUSION: Marked visual field constriction appears to be associated with vigabatrin therapy.	"vigabatrin	75	85	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""vigabatrin"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Myocardial ischemia due to coronary artery spasm during dobutamine stress echocardiography.	"dobutamine	56	66	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dobutamine"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Dobutamine stress echocardiography ( DSE) is a useful and safe provocation test for myocardial ischemia.	"Dobutamine	0	10	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Dobutamine"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Until now, the test has been focused only on the organic lesion in the coronary artery, and positive DSE has indicated the presence of significant fixed coronary artery stenosis.	[]
The aim of the present study is to examine whether myocardial ischemia due to coronary spasm is induced by dobutamine.	"dobutamine	107	117	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dobutamine"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We performed DSE on 51 patients with coronary spastic angina but without significant fixed coronary artery stenosis.	[]
All patients had anginal attacks at rest with ST elevation on the electrocardiogram ( variant angina).	[]
Coronary spasm was induced by intracoronary injection of acetylcholine, and no fixed coronary artery stenosis was documented on angiograms in all patients.	"acetylcholine	57	70	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""acetylcholine"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
DSE was performed with intravenous dobutamine infusion with an incremental doses of 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 microg / kg / min every 5 minutes.	"dobutamine	35	45	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dobutamine"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Of the 51 patients, 7 patients showed asynergy with ST elevation.	[]
All 7 patients ( 13. 7%) had chest pain during asynergy, and both chest pain and electrocardiographic changes were preceded by asynergy.	[]
These findings indicate that dobutamine can provoke coronary spasm in some patients with coronary spastic angina.	"dobutamine	29	39	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dobutamine"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
When DSE is performed to evaluate coronary artery disease, not only fixed coronary stenosis, but also coronary spasm should be considered as a genesis of asynergy.	[]

Summed stress and summed difference scores were not significantly reduced, although they were 18% and 30% lower, respectively, than control.	[]
No significant differences were found in any parameter between metoprolol and metoprolol - glucagon.

Evidence of functional somatotopy in GPi from results of pallidotomy.	[]
The objective of this study was to explore the functional anatomy of the globus pallidus internus ( GPi) by studying the effects of unilateral pallidotomy on parkinsonian ' off ' signs and levodopa - induced dyskinesias ( LID).	"levodopa	189	197	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""levodopa"", ""start_span"": 189, ""end_span"": 197, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We found significant positive correlations between the preoperative levodopa responsiveness of motor signs and the levodopa responsiveness of scores in timed tests ( Core Assessment Program for Intracerebral Transplantations) in the contralateral limbs and the improvement in these scores after surgery, whereas there was no correlation with the improvement in LID.	"levodopa	68	76	Chemical/Drug"	"levodopa	68	76	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""levodopa"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""levodopa"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We also found a highly significant correlation ( P: < 0. 0001, r = 0. 8) between the volume of the ventral lesion in the GPi and the improvement in LID in the contralateral limbs, whereas there was no correlation between the ventral volume and the improvement in parkinsonian ' off ' signs.	[]
The volumes of the total lesion cylinder and the dorsal lesion did not correlate with the outcome of either dyskinesias or parkinsonian ' off ' signs.	[]
The differential predictive value of levodopa responsiveness for the outcome of parkinsonian ' off ' signs and LID and the different correlations of ventral lesion volume with dyskinesias and parkinsonian ' off ' signs indicate that different anatomical or pathophysiological substrates may be responsible for the generation of parkinsonian ' off ' signs and dyskinesias.	"levodopa	37	45	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""levodopa"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Whereas cells in a wider area of the GPi may be implicated in parkinsonism, the ventral GPi seems to be crucial for the manifestation of LID.	[]
We suggest that our observations are additional proof of the functional somatotopy of the systems within the GPi that mediate parkinsonism and dyskinesias, especially along the dorsoventral trajectory used in pallidotomy.	[]
The outcome of pallidotomy in which the lesion involves the ventral and dorsal GPi could be the net effect of alteration in the activity of pathways which mediate different symptoms, and hence could be variable.	[]

Melatonin affects the circadian sleep / wake cycle, but it is not clear whether it may influence drug - induced narcosis.	"Melatonin	0	9	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Melatonin"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Sodium thiopenthal was administered intraperitoneally into male rats pre - treated with melatonin ( 0. 05, 0. 5, 5 and 50 mg / kg).	"Sodium thiopenthal	0	18	Chemical/Drug"	"melatonin	88	97	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Sodium thiopenthal"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""melatonin"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Melatonin pre - treatment affected in a dual manner barbiturate narcosis, however, no dose - effect correlation was found.	"Melatonin	0	9	Chemical/Drug"	"barbiturate	52	63	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Melatonin"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""barbiturate"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In particular, low doses reduced the latency to and prolonged the duration of barbiturate narcosis.	"barbiturate	78	89	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""barbiturate"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In contrast, the highest dose of melatonin ( 50 mg / kg) caused a paradoxical increase in the latency and produced a sustained reduction of the duration of narcosis, and a reduction in mortality rate.	"melatonin	33	42	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""melatonin"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Melatonin 0. 5 and 5 mg / kg influenced the duration but not the latency of ketamine - or diazepam - induced narcosis.	"Melatonin	0	9	Chemical/Drug"	"ketamine	76	84	Chemical/Drug"	"diazepam	90	98	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Melatonin"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""ketamine"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""diazepam"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Cardiotoxicity was defined by reductions in left - ventricular ejection fraction, assessed by serial multigated radionuclide angiography scans, or congestive heart failure ( CHF).	[]
Antitumor efficacy was assessed by objective tumor response rates ( World Health Organization criteria), time to progression, and survival.	[]
RESULTS: Six percent of MC patients versus 21% ( including five cases of CHF) of AC patients developed cardiotoxicity ( P =. 0002).	[]
Median cumulative doxorubicin dose at onset was more than 2, 220 mg / m ( 2) for MC versus 480 mg / m ( 2) for AC ( P =. 0001, hazard ratio, 5. 04).	"doxorubicin	18	29	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""doxorubicin"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
MC patients also experienced less grade 4 neutropenia.	[]
Antitumor efficacy of MC versus AC was comparable: objective response rates, 43% versus 43%; median time to progression, 5. 1% versus 5. 5 months; median time to treatment failure, 4. 6 versus 4. 4 months; and median survival, 19 versus 16 months.	[]
CONCLUSION: Myocet improves the therapeutic index of doxorubicin by significantly reducing cardiotoxicity and grade 4 neutropenia and provides comparable antitumor efficacy, when used in combination with cyclophosphamide as first - line therapy for MBC.

Although these drugs are highly effective and represent the mainstay of transplant immunosuppression, they are associated with acute and chronic nephrotoxicity.	[]
Acute nephrotoxicity, which occurs in the early period after transplantation, leads to a higher rate of dialysis, and chronic nephrotoxicity may eventually result in graft loss.	[]
Acute and chronic nephrotoxicity is becoming more common as the use of marginal kidneys for transplantation increases.	[]
Two recently available immunosuppressive agents, mycophenolate mofetil and sirolimus ( rapamycin), have no nephrotoxicity.

Comparison of aqueous and gellan ophthalmic timolol with placebo on the 24 - hour heart rate response in patients on treatment for glaucoma.	"timolol	44	51	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""timolol"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
PURPOSE: Topical beta - blocker treatment is routine therapy in the management of patients with glaucoma.	[]
Therapy results in systemic absorption, however, the degree of reduction of resting and peak heart rate has not been quantified.	[]
DESIGN: This trial evaluated the effect of placebo, 0. 5% aqueous timolol ( timolol solution) and a 0. 5% timolol suspension that forms a gel on application to the conjunctiva ( timolol gellan) on the 24 - hour heart rate in patients currently being treated for glaucoma to quantify the reduction in mean heart rate.

On the 13th day of each period, heart rate was recorded continuously during a typical, ambulant 24 - hour period.	[]
RESULTS: Both timolol solution and timolol gellan reduced the mean 24 - hour heart rate compared with placebo ( P < or =. 001), and this reduction was most pronounced during the daytime ( - 7. 5% change in mean heart rate, - 5. 7 beats / min).

This response was most pronounced during the active daytime period.	[]
These data quantify the modest bradycardia associated with ophthalmic beta - blocker therapy in a typical patient population on therapy for glaucoma.	[]
Although exercise performance was not assessed in this trial, reductions of this magnitude should not have substantial clinical consequences.	[]

OBJECTIVES: Recently published studies have demonstrated increased efficacy and cost - effectiveness of combination therapy with interferon and alpha - 2b / ribavirin compared with interferon - alpha monotherapy in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C ( CHC).	"ribavirin	157	166	Chemical/Drug"	"interferon - alpha	181	199	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ribavirin"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 166, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""interferon - alpha"", ""start_span"": 181, ""end_span"": 199, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Combination therapy is associated with a clinically important adverse effect: ribavirin - induced hemolytic anemia ( RIHA).	"ribavirin	78	87	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ribavirin"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The objective of this study was to evaluate the direct health - care costs and management of RIHA during treatment of CHC in a clinical trial setting.	[]
METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to synthesize information on the incidence and management of RIHA.	[]
Decision - analytic techniques were used to estimate the cost of treating RIHA.	[]
Uncertainty was evaluated using sensitivity analyses.	[]
RESULTS: RIHA, defined as a reduction in hemoglobin to less than 100 g / L, occurs in approximately 7% to 9% of patients treated with combination therapy.	[]
The standard of care for management of RIHA is reduction or discontinuation of the ribavirin dosage.	"ribavirin	83	92	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ribavirin"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We estimated the direct cost of treating clinically significant RIHA to be 170 per patient receiving combination therapy per 48 - week treatment course ( range 68 - 692).	[]
The results of the one - way sensitivity analyses ranged from 57 to 317.	[]
In comparison, the cost of 48 weeks of combination therapy is 16, 459.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: The direct cost of treating clinically significant RIHA is 1% ( 170 / 16, 459) of drug treatment costs.	[]
Questions remain about the optimal dose of ribavirin and the incidence of RIHA in a real - world population.	"ribavirin	43	52	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ribavirin"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Despite these uncertainties, this initial evaluation of the direct cost of treating RIHA provides an estimate of the cost and management implications of this clinically important adverse effect.	[]

BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies of intrathecal adenosine suggest it may be effective in the treatment of acute and chronic pain in humans, and preliminary studies in volunteers and patients with a Swedish formulation of adenosine suggests it may be effective in hypersensitivity states but not with acute noxious stimulation.	"adenosine	47	56	Chemical/Drug"	"adenosine	47	56	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""adenosine"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""adenosine"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The purpose of this study was to screen for efficacy of a different formulation of adenosine marketed in the US, using both acute noxious stimulation and capsaicin - evoked mechanical hypersensitivity.	"adenosine	83	92	Chemical/Drug"	"capsaicin	154	163	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""adenosine"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""capsaicin"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 163, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METHODS: Following Food and Drug Administration and institutional review board approval and written informed consent, 65 volunteers were studied in two trials: an open - label, dose - escalating trial with intrathecal adenosine doses of 0. 25 - 2. 0 mg and a double - blind, placebo - controlled trial of adenosine, 2 mg.	"adenosine	218	227	Chemical/Drug"	"adenosine	218	227	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""adenosine"", ""start_span"": 218, ""end_span"": 227, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""adenosine"", ""start_span"": 218, ""end_span"": 227, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Cerebrospinal fluid was obtained for pharmacokinetic analysis, and pain ratings in response to acute heat stimuli and areas of mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia after intradermal capsaicin injection were determined.	"capsaicin	183	192	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""capsaicin"", ""start_span"": 183, ""end_span"": 192, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
RESULTS: Adenosine produced no effect on pain report to acute noxious thermal or chemical stimulation but reduced mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia from intradermal capsaicin injection for at least 24 h.	"Adenosine	9	18	Chemical/Drug"	"capsaicin	169	178	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Adenosine"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""capsaicin"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In contrast, residence time of adenosine in cerebrospinal fluid was short ( < 4 h).	"adenosine	31	40	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""adenosine"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
CONCLUSIONS: These results show selective inhibition by intrathecal adenosine of hypersensitivity, presumed to reflect central sensitization in humans after peripheral capsaicin injection.	"adenosine	68	77	Chemical/Drug"	"capsaicin	168	177	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""adenosine"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""capsaicin"", ""start_span"": 168, ""end_span"": 177, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The long - lasting effect is consistent with that observed in preliminary reports of patients with chronic neuropathic pain and is not due to prolonged residence of adenosine in cerebrospinal fluid.

RESULTS: Patients went home after hospitalizations that had included heparin exposure - - in most cases, with no thrombocytopenia recognized - - only to return to the hospital ( median, day 14) with thromboembolic complications.	"heparin	69	76	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""heparin"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Thromboemboli were venous ( 12 patients, 7 with pulmonary emboli) or arterial ( 4 patients) or both.	[]
Platelet counts were mildly decreased in all but 2 patients on second presentation.	[]
On readmission, 11 patients received therapeutic heparin, which worsened the patients ' clinical condition and, in all 11 cases, decreased the platelet count ( mean at readmission, 143 x 10 ( 9) cells / L; mean nadir after heparin re - exposure, 39 x 10 ( 9) cells / L).

We report on a 92 - year - old woman with preexisting complete left bundle branch block who developed torsade de pointes after intravenous and oral administration of metoclopramide.	"metoclopramide	166	180	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""metoclopramide"", ""start_span"": 166, ""end_span"": 180, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
This patient also developed torsade de pointes when cisapride and erythromycin were given simultaneously.	"cisapride	52	61	Chemical/Drug"	"erythromycin	66	78	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cisapride"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""erythromycin"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
These two episodes were suppressed successfully after discontinuing the offending drugs and administering class IB drugs.	[]
This is the first documentation that metoclopramide provokes torsade de pointes clinically.	"metoclopramide	37	51	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""metoclopramide"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Dopamine ( DA), through D1 / D2 receptor - mediated signaling, plays a major role in the control of epileptic seizures arising in the limbic system.

Excitotoxicity leading to neuronal cell death in the affected areas is a major consequence of seizures at the cellular level.	[]
In this respect, little is known about the role of DA receptors in the occurrence of epilepsy - induced neuronal cell death.	"DA	51	53	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""DA"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Here we analyze the occurrence of seizures and neurotoxicity in D2R - / - mice treated with the cholinergic agonist pilocarpine.	"pilocarpine	116	127	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""pilocarpine"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We compared these results with those previously obtained with kainic acid ( KA), a potent glutamate agonist.	"kainic acid	62	73	Chemical/Drug"	"KA	76	78	Chemical/Drug"	"glutamate	90	99	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""kainic acid"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""KA"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""glutamate"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Importantly, D2R - / - mice develop seizures at doses of both drugs that are not epileptogenic for WT littermates and show greater neurotoxicity.	[]
However, pilocarpine - induced seizures result in a more widespread neuronal death in both WT and D2R - / - brains in comparison to KA.	"pilocarpine	9	20	Chemical/Drug"	"KA	132	134	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""pilocarpine"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""KA"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Thus, the absence of D2R lowers the threshold for seizures induced by both glutamate and acetylcholine.	"glutamate	75	84	Chemical/Drug"	"acetylcholine	89	102	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""glutamate"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""acetylcholine"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Moreover, the dopaminergic control of epilepsy - induced neurodegeneration seems to be mediated by distinct interactions of D2R signaling with these two neurotransmitters.	[]
Steroid structure and pharmacological properties determine the anti - amnesic effects of pregnenolone sulphate in the passive avoidance task in rats.

Pregnenolone sulphate ( PREGS) has generated interest as one of the most potent memory - enhancing neurosteroids to be examined in rodent learning studies, with particular importance in the ageing process.	"Pregnenolone sulphate	0	21	Chemical/Drug"	"PREGS	24	29	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Pregnenolone sulphate"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""PREGS"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The mechanism by which this endogenous steroid enhances memory formation is hypothesized to involve actions on glutamatergic and GABAergic systems.	"steroid	39	46	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""steroid"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
This hypothesis stems from findings that PREGS is a potent positive modulator of N - methyl - d - aspartate receptors ( NMDARs) and a negative modulator of gamma - aminobutyric acid ( A) receptors ( GABA ( A) Rs).	"PREGS	41	46	Chemical/Drug"	"N - methyl - d - aspartate	81	107	Chemical/Drug"	"gamma - aminobutyric acid	156	181	Chemical/Drug"	"GABA	199	203	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""PREGS"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""N - methyl - d - aspartate"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""gamma - aminobutyric acid"", ""start_span"": 156, ""end_span"": 181, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""GABA"", ""start_span"": 199, ""end_span"": 203, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Moreover, PREGS is able to reverse the amnesic - like effects of NMDAR and GABA ( A) R ligands.	"PREGS	10	15	Chemical/Drug"	"GABA	75	79	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""PREGS"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""GABA"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
To investigate this hypothesis, the present study in rats examined the memory - altering abilities of structural analogs of PREGS, which differ in their modulation of NMDAR and / or GABA ( A) R function.	"PREGS	124	129	Chemical/Drug"	"GABA	182	186	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""PREGS"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""GABA"", ""start_span"": 182, ""end_span"": 186, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The analogs tested were: 11 - ketopregnenolone sulphate ( an agent that is inactive at GABA ( A) Rs and NMDARs), epipregnanolone ( [ 3beta - hydroxy - 5beta - pregnan - 20 - one] sulphate, an inhibitor of both GABA ( A) Rs and NMDARs), and a newly synthesized ( -) PREGS enantiomer ( which is identical to PREGS in effects on GABA ( A) Rs and NMDARs).	"11 - ketopregnenolone sulphate	25	55	Chemical/Drug"	"GABA	87	91	Chemical/Drug"	"GABA	87	91	Chemical/Drug"	"PREGS	265	270	Chemical/Drug"	"PREGS	265	270	Chemical/Drug"	"GABA	87	91	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""11 - ketopregnenolone sulphate"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""GABA"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""GABA"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""PREGS"", ""start_span"": 265, ""end_span"": 270, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""PREGS"", ""start_span"": 265, ""end_span"": 270, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""GABA"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The memory - enhancing effects of PREGS and its analogs were tested in the passive avoidance task using the model of scopolamine - induced amnesia.	"PREGS	34	39	Chemical/Drug"	"scopolamine	117	128	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""PREGS"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""scopolamine"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Both PREGS and its ( -) enantiomer blocked the effects of scopolamine.

The results show that, unlike PREGS, 11 - ketopregnenolone sulphate and epipregnanolone sulphate failed to block the effect of scopolamine, suggesting that altering the modulation of NMDA receptors diminishes the memory - enhancing effects of PREGS.	"PREGS	30	35	Chemical/Drug"	"11 - ketopregnenolone sulphate	37	67	Chemical/Drug"	"epipregnanolone sulphate	72	96	Chemical/Drug"	"scopolamine	127	138	Chemical/Drug"	"NMDA	183	187	Chemical/Drug"	"PREGS	30	35	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""PREGS"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""11 - ketopregnenolone sulphate"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""epipregnanolone sulphate"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""scopolamine"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""NMDA"", ""start_span"": 183, ""end_span"": 187, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""PREGS"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Moreover, enantioselectivity was demonstrated by the ability of natural PREGS to be an order of magnitude more effective than its synthetic enantiomer in reversing scopolamine - induced amnesia.	"PREGS	72	77	Chemical/Drug"	"scopolamine	164	175	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""PREGS"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""scopolamine"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 175, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
These results identify a novel neuropharmacological site for the modulation of memory processes by neuroactive steroids.	"steroids	111	119	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""steroids"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Activation of the nuclear enzyme poly ( ADP - ribose) polymerase ( PARP) by oxidant - mediated DNA damage is an important pathway of cell dysfunction and tissue injury in conditions associated with oxidative stress.	[]
Increased oxidative stress is a major factor implicated in the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin ( DOX), a widely used antitumor anthracycline antibiotic.

Using a dual approach of PARP - 1 suppression, by genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition with the phenanthridinone PARP inhibitor PJ34, we now demonstrate the role of PARP in the development of cardiac dysfunction induced by DOX.

We studied two groups of Parkinson ' s disease patients with ( Parkinson ' s disease + LID, n = 23) and without levodopa - induced dyskinesias ( Parkinson ' s disease - LID, n = 10), and age - matched healthy controls.	"levodopa	112	120	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""levodopa"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The motor score of the Unified Parkinson ' s Disease Rating Scale, a dyskinesia score and force in a grip - lift paradigm were assessed ON and OFF levodopa.	"levodopa	147	155	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""levodopa"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 155, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
A pathological increase of forces was seen in ON - state in Parkinson ' s disease + LID only.	[]
In Parkinson ' s disease + LID, the force involved in pressing down the object before lifting was significantly increased by levodopa ( by 61%, P < 0. 05).	"levodopa	125	133	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""levodopa"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
An overshooting of peak grip force by 51% ( P < 0. 05) and of static grip force by 45% ( P < 0. 01) was observed in the ON - compared with the OFF - drug condition.	[]
In contrast, no excessive force was found in Parkinson ' s disease - LID.	[]
Peak grip force in ON - state was 140% ( P < 0. 05) higher in Parkinson ' s disease + LID than in Parkinson ' s disease - LID, while static grip force was increased by 138% ( P < 0. 01) between groups.	[]
Severity of peak - dose dyskinesias was strongly correlated with grip force in ON - state ( r = 0. 79 with peak force, P < 0. 01).	[]
No correlation was observed between forces and the motor score as well as with the daily dose of dopaminergic medication.	[]
Force excess was only observed in patients with LID and motor fluctuations.	[]
A close relationship was seen between the overshooting of forces and dyskinesias in the ON - drug condition.	[]
We postulate that both LID and grip force excess share common pathophysiological mechanisms related to motor fluctuations.	[]

This study focuses on behavioral syndromes that may used as models for Parkinson ' s disease, or tardive dyskinesia, and its response after glutamatergic blockage.	[]
Reserpine ( 1 mg / kg), administered once every other day for 4 days, produced increases in orofacial dyskinesia, tongue protrusion and vacuous chewing in mice, which are signs indicative of tardive dyskinesia.	"Reserpine	0	9	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Reserpine"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Pretreatment with reserpine ( 1 mg / kg) 24 h before the observation test produced increases in vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusion, as well as increases in tremor and catalepsy, whereas MK - 801 ( 0. 1 mg / kg) injection 90 min before the test reversed the effects of reserpine.

BACKGROUND: Adenovirus is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised host.	[]
The incidence of severe adenovirus disease in pediatrics is increasing in association with growing numbers of immunocompromised children, where case fatality rates as high as 50% to 80% have been reported.	[]
There are no approved antiviral agents with proven efficacy for the treatment of severe adenovirus disease, nor are there any prospective randomized, controlled trials of potentially useful anti - adenovirus therapies.	[]
Apparent clinical success in the treatment of severe adenovirus disease is limited to a few case reports and small series.	[]
Experience is greatest with intravenous ribavirin and cidofovir.

OBJECTIVE: We report our experience with intravenous ribavirin therapy for severe adenovirus disease in a series of immunocompromised children and review the literature.	"ribavirin	53	62	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ribavirin"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
DESIGN / METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 5 children treated with intravenous ribavirin for documented severe adenovirus disease.	"ribavirin	105	114	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ribavirin"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

An additional 3 children developed adenovirus pneumonia; 2 were neonates, 1 of whom had partial DiGeorge syndrome.	[]

RESULTS: Complete clinical recovery followed later by viral clearance was observed in 2 children: the cardiac transplant recipient with adenovirus hemorrhagic cystitis and the immunocompetent neonate with adenovirus pneumonia.	[]
The remaining 3 children died of adenovirus disease.	[]
Intravenous ribavirin therapy was well tolerated.	"ribavirin	12	21	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ribavirin"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

DISCUSSION: Our series of patients is representative of the spectrum of immunocompromised children at greatest risk for severe adenovirus disease, namely solid - organ and bone marrow transplant recipients, neonates, and children with immunodeficiency.	[]
Although intravenous ribavirin was not effective for all children with severe adenovirus disease in this series or in the literature, therapy is unlikely to be of benefit if begun late in the course of the infection.	"ribavirin	21	30	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ribavirin"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Early identification, eg by polymerase chain reaction of those patients at risk of disseminated adenovirus disease may permit earlier antiviral treatment and better evaluation of therapeutic response.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: Two of 5 children with severe adenovirus disease treated with intravenous ribavirin recovered.	"ribavirin	87	96	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ribavirin"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The availability of newer rapid diagnostic techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction, may make earlier, more effective treatment of adenovirus infection possible.	[]
Given the seriousness and increasing prevalence of adenovirus disease in certain hosts, especially children, a large, multicenter clinical trial of potentially useful anti - adenoviral therapies, such as intravenous ribavirin, is clearly required to demonstrate the most effective and least toxic therapy.

BACKGROUND: The interruption of oral anticoagulant ( OAC) administration is sometimes indicated in patients with mechanical heart valves, mainly before noncardiac surgery, non - surgical interventions, and pregnancy.	[]
Unfractionated heparin ( UH) is currently the substitute for selected patients.

HYPOTHESIS: The aim of the present study was to review the data accumulated so far on the use of LMWH in this patient population and to discuss its applicability in common practice.	"LMWH	97	101	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""LMWH"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METHODS: For this paper, the current medical literature on LMWH in patients with mechanical heart valves was extensively reviewed.	"LMWH	59	63	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""LMWH"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
RESULTS: There were eight series and six case reports.	[]
None of the studies was randomized, and only one was prospective.	[]
Data to establish the thromboembolic risk were incomplete.	[]
After excluding case reports, the following groups were constructed: ( a) short - term administration, after valve insertion ( n = 212); ( b) short - term, perioperative ( noncardiac) / periprocedural ( n = 114); ( c) long - term, due to intolerance to OAC ( n = 16); ( d) long - term, in pregnancy ( n = 10).	[]
The incidence rate of thromboembolism was 0. 9% for all the studies and 0. 5, 0, 20, and 0% in groups a, b, c, and d, respectively; for hemorrhage, the overall rate was 3. 4% ( 3. 8, 2. 6, 10, and 0% for the respective groups).	[]
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with mechanical heart valves, short - term LMWH therapy compares favorably with UH.

Arteritis induced in rats by vasodilators, fenoldopam and theophylline, was examined immunohistochemically for expressions of inducible type of nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS), basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF) and tumor growth factor - beta1 ( TGF - beta1).	"fenoldopam	43	53	Chemical/Drug"	"theophylline	58	70	Chemical/Drug"	"nitric oxide	144	156	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""fenoldopam"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""theophylline"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""nitric oxide"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Rats were administered fenoldopam for 24 hours by intravenous infusion with or without following repeated daily oral administrations of theophylline.

Irrespective of theophylline administration, iNOS antigens were remarkably abundant in ED - 1 - positive cells on day 5 and 8 post - fenoldopam - infusion ( DPI); bFGF antigens were remarkably abundant in ED - 1 - positive cells on 1 and 3 DPI; TGF - beta1 antigens were observed in ED - 1 - positive cells on and after 5 DPI.

These results suggest that the peak expression of iNOS antigen was followed by that of bFGF antigen, and bFGF may have a suppressive effect on iNOS expression in these rat arteritis models.	[]
On the other hand, TGF - beta1 was not considered to have a suppressive effect on iNOS expression in these models.	[]

Fifty - nine per cent of patients had had previous therapy with IL - 2 and 52% were performance status 2 or 3.	[]
Systemic plasma VEGF165 levels were measured by dual monoclonal ELISA in 8 patients.	[]
RESULTS: 24 patients were evaluable for response with one partial response of 11 months duration of a patient with hepatic and pulmonary metastases ( 4%), one minor response, and 2 patients stable for over 6 months.	[]
Somnolence and constipation were prominent toxicities and most patients could not tolerate the 1200 mg / day dose level.	[]
Systemic plasma VEGF165 levels did not change with therapy.	[]

Following administration of these agents, the presence, and degree of fasciculation were assessed visually on a four point scale by one investigator who was blinded to the drug administered.	[]
The blood pressure and heart rate of each patient were monitored on nine occasions.	[]
Twenty - four hours later, any myalgia experienced was assessed according to a structured questionaire and graded by a four point scale by one investigator blinded to the intraoperative management.	[]
The results indicate that muscle fasciculation was not found in Group PR while the patients in Group LS had a lower incidence of muscle fasciculation than those in Group PS ( p < 0. 001).	[]
At 24 h, the incidence of myalgia was higher in Group PS than in Group LS and PR ( p < 0. 05).	[]
A correlation was not found between the incidence of myalgia and the occurrence of muscle fasciculation.	[]
The changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were not significant among the three groups.	[]

The pathogenesis of this myalgia is still unclear; inflammation has been suggested but without convincing evidence.	[]
We designed the present study to investigate whether an inflammatory reaction contributes to this myalgia.	[]
The incidence and severity of succinylcholine - associated myalgia was determined in 64 patients pretreated with saline or dexamethasone before succinylcholine ( n = 32 for each).	"succinylcholine	30	45	Chemical/Drug"	"dexamethasone	123	136	Chemical/Drug"	"succinylcholine	30	45	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""succinylcholine"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""dexamethasone"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""succinylcholine"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Incidence and severity of myalgia did not differ significantly between the two groups: 15 patients in the dexamethasone group complained of myalgia compared with 18 patients in the saline group, and severe myalgia was reported by five patients and three patients, respectively ( not significant).	"dexamethasone	106	119	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dexamethasone"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
At 48 h after surgery, 12 patients in both groups still suffered from myalgia ( not significant).	[]
In addition, interleukin - 6 ( IL - 6) as an early marker of inflammation was assessed in a subgroup of 10 patients pretreated with saline.	[]
We found an increase of IL - 6 for only three patients, but only one patient reported myalgia; no relationship between myalgia and the increase of IL - 6 was found.	[]
In conclusion, there is no evidence for an inflammatory origin of succinylcholine - associated myalgia.	"succinylcholine	66	81	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""succinylcholine"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
IMPLICATIONS: Administration of dexamethasone before succinylcholine was not effective in decreasing the incidence or the severity of succinylcholine - induced postoperative myalgia.

Oral administration of lindane ( 2. 5, 5, 10 and 15 mg / kg, body weight) for 5 days was found to produce a dose - dependent increase in the activity of P450 dependent 7 - ethoxyresorufin - O - deethylase ( EROD), 7 - pentoxyresorufin - O - dealkylase ( PROD) and N - nitrosodimethylamine demethylase ( NDMA - d) in rat brain and liver.

A significant increase in the hepatic and brain P450 monooxygenases was also observed when the duration of exposure of low dose ( 2. 5 mg / kg) of lindane was increased from 5 days to 15 or 21 days.	"lindane	147	154	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""lindane"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
As observed with different doses, the magnitude of induction in the activity of P450 monooxygenases was several fold higher in liver microsomes when compared with the brain.	[]
Western blotting studies have indicated that the increase in the P450 enzymes could be due to the increase in the expression of P450 1A1 / 1A2, 2B1 / 2B2 and 2E1 isoenzymes.	[]
In vitro studies using organic inhibitors specific for individual P450 isoenzymes and antibody inhibition experiments have further demonstrated that the increase in the activity of PROD, EROD and NDMA - d are due to the increase in the levels of P450 2B1 / 2B2, 1A1 / 1A2 and 2E1 isoenzymes, respectively.	"NDMA	196	200	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""NDMA"", ""start_span"": 196, ""end_span"": 200, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Induction studies have further shown that while pretreatment of 3 - methylcholanthrene ( MC), an inducer of P4501A1 / 1A2, did not produce any significant effect in the incidence of lindane induced convulsions, pretreatment with phenobarbital ( PB), an inducer of P450 2B1 / 2B2 or ethanol, an inducer of P450 2E1 catalysed reactions, significantly increased the incidence of lindane induced convulsions.

Similarly, when the P450 - mediated metabolism of lindane was blocked by cobalt chloride incidence of convulsions was increased in animals treated with lindane indicating that lindane per se or its metabolites formed by PB or ethanol inducible P450 isoenzymes are involved in its neurobehavioral toxicity.

BACKGROUND: Analysis of the literature for nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) suggests that a low incidence of developmental anomalies occurs in rats given NSAIDs on specific days during organogenesis.	[]
Aspirin ( acetylsalicylic acid [ ASA]), an irreversible cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 inhibitor, induces developmental anomalies when administered to Wistar rats on gestational day ( GD) 9, 10, or 11 ( Kimmel CA, Wilson JG, Schumacher HJ. Teratology 4: 15 - 24, 1971).

There are no published ASA studies using the multiple dosing paradigm of GDs 6 to 17.	"ASA	23	26	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ASA"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Objectives of the current study were to compare results between Sprague - Dawley ( SD) and Wistar strains when ASA is administered on GD 9, 10, or 11; to compare the malformation patterns following single and multiple dosings during organogenesis in SD rats; and to test the hypothesis that maternal gastrointestinal toxicity confounds the detection of low incidence malformations with ASA when a multiple dosing paradigm is used.

METHODS: ASA was administered as a single dose on GD 9 ( 0, 250, 500, or 625 mg / kg), 10 ( 0, 500, 625, or 750 mg / kg), or 11 ( 0, 500, 750, or 1000 mg / kg) and from GD 6 to GD 17 ( 0, 50, 125, or 250 mg / kg a day) in the multiple dose study to SD rats.

Animals were killed on GD 21, and fetuses were examined viscerally.	[]
RESULTS: The literature evaluation suggested that NSAIDs induce ventricular septal defects ( VSDs) and midline defects ( MDs) in rats and diaphragmatic hernia ( DH), MDs, and VSDs in rabbits ( Cook JC et al., 2003); hence, the present study focused on these malformations, even though ASA induces several other low - incidence malformations.	"ASA	285	288	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ASA"", ""start_span"": 285, ""end_span"": 288, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In single dose studies, DH, MD, and VSD were induced on GDs 9 and 10.	[]
VSD also was noted following treatment on GD 11.	[]
In contrast, DH and MD were noted in the multiple dose study design only in the high - dose group, and VSD was noted across all dose groups.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: High concordance in major developmental anomalies between Wistar and SD rats were noted with the exception of VSD in the SD rats and hydrocephalus in the Wistar rats.	[]
Variations and malformations were similar when ASA was administered as a single dose or during the period of organogenesis ( GDs 6 to 17).	"ASA	47	50	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ASA"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
It was also evident that, by titrating the dose to achieve a maximum tolerated dose, malformations that normally occur at low incidence, as reported from previous single dose studies, could also be induced with ASA given at multiple doses.

Cystitis was evaluated 24 h after its induction by the changes in bladder wet weight and by macroscopic and microscopic analysis.	[]
RESULTS: The replacement of the last dose or the last two doses of mesna with dexamethasone reduced the increase in bladder wet weight induced by IFS by 84. 79% and 89. 13%, respectively.

The combinations of loreclezole ( 2. 5 mg / kg) with valproate, clonazepam, or carbamazepine ( applied at their subprotective doses) also exhibited antiseizure effect in this test.

On the other hand, bicuculline, aminophylline and BAY k - 8644 inhibited the anticonvulsive action of loreclezole combined with clonazepam.

BACKGROUND: Doxorubicin induces a self - perpetuating nephropathy characterized by early glomerular and late - onset tubular lesions in rats.	"Doxorubicin	12	23	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Doxorubicin"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We investigated the potential role of mitochondrial injury in the onset of these lesions.	[]
METHODS: Rats were treated with intravenous doxorubicin ( 1 mg kg ( - 1) week ( - 1)) for 7 weeks and were sacrificed either 1 week ( ' short - term ') or 30 weeks ( ' long - term ') following the last dose.	"doxorubicin	44	55	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""doxorubicin"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Additional rats received a single dose either 6 days or 2 h prior to euthanasia.	[]
All rats were killed at 48 weeks of age.	[]
Glomerular and tubular injury was monitored and correlated to the activity or expression of respiratory chain components.	[]
Finally, we quantified both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA) as well as superoxide production and the 4834 base pair ' common ' mtDNA deletion.	"superoxide	78	88	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""superoxide"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
RESULTS: The ' long - term ' group had significant glomerular and tubular lesions, depressed activities of mtDNA - encoded NADH dehydrogenase and cytochrome - c oxidase ( COX) and increased citrate synthase activity.	"citrate	190	197	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""citrate"", ""start_span"": 190, ""end_span"": 197, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In addition, expression of the mtDNA - encoded COX subunit I was reduced and mtDNA levels were decreased.	[]
In ' short - term ' rats, there were fewer tubular lesions, but similar numbers of glomerular lesions activity.	[]
Among all animals, glomerular and tubular injury were inversely correlated with mtDNA levels, mtDNA - encoded respiratory chain activities and with the expression of the mtDNA - encoded respiratory chain subunit COX - I.	[]
Injury was positively correlated with superoxide production and the activities of nucleus - encoded mitochondrial or cytoplasmic enzymes.	"superoxide	38	48	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""superoxide"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Kidneys from the ' long - term ' group showed more mtDNA deletions than in ' short - term ' animals and these were not observed in the other groups.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest an important role for quantitative and qualitative mtDNA alterations through the reduction of mtDNA - encoded respiratory chain function and induction of superoxide in doxorubicin - induced renal lesions.

The protein abundance of alpha - ENaC and beta - ENaC was increased in the inner stripe of the outer medulla ( ISOM) and in the inner medulla ( IM) but was not altered in the cortex.	[]
gamma - ENaC abundance was increased in the cortex, ISOM, and IM.	[]
Immunoperoxidase brightfield - and laser - scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy demonstrated increased targeting of alpha - ENaC, beta - ENaC, and gamma - ENaC subunits to the apical plasma membrane in the distal convoluted tubule ( DCT2), connecting tubule, and cortical and medullary collecting duct segments.

In conclusion, the increased or sustained expression of ENaC subunits combined with increased apical targeting in the DCT2, connecting tubule, and collecting duct are likely to play a role in the sodium retention associated with PAN - induced nephrotic syndrome.

The decreased abundance of NHE3, BSC - 1, TSC, and Na - K - ATPase may play a compensatory role to promote sodium excretion.

Pallidal stimulation: an alternative to pallidotomy?	[]
A resurgence of interest in the surgical treatment of Parkinson ' s disease ( PD) came with the rediscovery of posteroventral pallidotomy by Laitinen in 1985.	[]
Laitinen ' s procedure improved most symptoms in drug - resistant PD, which engendered wide interest in the neurosurgical community.	[]
Another lesioning procedure, ventrolateral thalamotomy, has become a powerful alternative to stimulate the nucleus ventralis intermedius, producing high long - term success rates and low morbidity rates.	[]
Pallidal stimulation has not met with the same success.	[]
"According to the literature pallidotomy improves the "" on "" symptoms of PD, such as dyskinesias, as well as the "" off "" symptoms, such as rigidity, bradykinesia, and on - off fluctuations."	[]
Pallidal stimulation improves bradykinesia and rigidity to a minor extent; however, its strength seems to be in improving levodopa - induced dyskinesias.	"levodopa	122	130	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""levodopa"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
"Stimulation often produces an improvement in the hyper - or dyskinetic upper limbs, but increases the "" freezing "" phenomenon in the lower limbs at the same time."	[]
Considering the small increase in the patient ' s independence, the high costs of bilateral implants, and the difficulty most patients experience in handling the devices, the question arises as to whether bilateral pallidal stimulation is a real alternative to pallidotomy.	[]

Consensus statement concerning cardiotoxicity occurring during haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, with special reference to systemic sclerosis and multiple sclerosis.	[]
Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is now a feasible and effective treatment for selected patients with severe autoimmune diseases.	[]
Worldwide, over 650 patients have been transplanted in the context of phase I and II clinical trials.	[]
The results are encouraging enough to begin randomised phase III trials.	[]
However, as predicted, significant transplant - related morbidity and mortality have been observed.	[]
This is primarily due to complications related to either the stage of the disease at transplant or due to infections.	[]
The number of deaths related to cardiac toxicity is low.	[]
However, caution is required when cyclophosphamide or anthracyclines such as mitoxantrone are used in patients with a possible underlying heart damage, for example, systemic sclerosis patients.

Does supplemental vitamin C increase cardiovascular disease risk in women with diabetes?	"vitamin C	18	27	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""vitamin C"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
BACKGROUND: Vitamin C acts as a potent antioxidant; however, it can also be a prooxidant and glycate protein under certain circumstances in vitro.	"Vitamin C	12	21	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Vitamin C"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
These observations led us to hypothesize that a high intake of vitamin C in diabetic persons might promote atherosclerosis.	"vitamin C	63	72	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""vitamin C"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the relation between vitamin C intake and mortality from cardiovascular disease.	"vitamin C	61	70	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""vitamin C"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
DESIGN: We studied the relation between vitamin C intake and mortality from total cardiovascular disease ( n = 281), coronary artery disease ( n = 175), and stroke ( n = 57) in 1923 postmenopausal women who reported being diabetic at baseline.	"vitamin C	40	49	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""vitamin C"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Diet was assessed with a food - frequency questionnaire at baseline, and subjects initially free of coronary artery disease were prospectively followed for 15 y.	[]
RESULTS: After adjustment for cardiovascular disease risk factors, type of diabetes medication used, duration of diabetes, and intakes of folate, vitamin E, and beta - carotene, the adjusted relative risks of total cardiovascular disease mortality were 1. 0, 0. 97, 1. 11, 1. 47, and 1. 84 ( P for trend < 0. 01) across quintiles of total vitamin C intake from food and supplements.

Adjusted relative risks of coronary artery disease were 1. 0, 0. 81, 0. 99, 1. 26, and 1. 91 ( P for trend = 0. 01) and of stroke were 1. 0, 0. 52, 1. 23, 2. 22, and 2. 57 ( P for trend < 0. 01).	[]
When dietary and supplemental vitamin C were analyzed separately, only supplemental vitamin C showed a positive association with mortality endpoints.	"vitamin C	30	39	Chemical/Drug"	"vitamin C	30	39	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""vitamin C"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""vitamin C"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Vitamin C intake was unrelated to mortality from cardiovascular disease in the nondiabetic subjects at baseline.	"Vitamin C	0	9	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Vitamin C"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
CONCLUSION: A high vitamin C intake from supplements is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease mortality in postmenopausal women with diabetes.	"vitamin C	19	28	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""vitamin C"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Optical coherence tomography can measure axonal loss in patients with ethambutol - induced optic neuropathy.	"ethambutol	70	80	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ethambutol"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
PURPOSE: To map and identify the pattern, in vivo, of axonal degeneration in ethambutol - induced optic neuropathy using optical coherence tomography ( OCT).	"ethambutol	77	87	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ethambutol"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Ethambutol is an antimycobacterial agent often used to treat tuberculosis.	"Ethambutol	0	10	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Ethambutol"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
A serious complication of ethambutol is an optic neuropathy that impairs visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and color vision.	"ethambutol	26	36	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ethambutol"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
However, early on, when the toxic optic neuropathy is mild and partly reversible, the funduscopic findings are often subtle and easy to miss.	[]
METHODS: Three subjects with a history of ethambutol ( EMB) - induced optic neuropathy of short -, intermediate -, and long - term visual deficits were administered a full neuro - ophthalmologic examination including visual acuity, color vision, contrast sensitivity, and fundus examination.	"ethambutol	42	52	Chemical/Drug"	"EMB	55	58	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ethambutol"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""EMB"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In addition, OCT ( OCT 3000, Humphrey - Zeiss, Dublin, CA) was performed on both eyes of each subject using the retinal nerve fiber layer ( RNFL) analysis protocol.	[]
OCT interpolates data from 100 points around the optic nerve to effectively map out the RNFL.	[]
RESULTS: The results were compared to the calculated average RNFL of normal eyes accumulated from four prior studies using OCT, n = 661.	[]
In all subjects with history of EMB - induced optic neuropathy, there was a mean loss of 72% nerve fiber layer thickness in the temporal quadrant ( patient A, with eventual recovery of visual acuity and fields, 58% loss; patient B, with intermediate visual deficits, 68% loss; patient C, with chronic visual deficits, 90% loss), with an average mean optic nerve thickness of 26 + / - 16 microm.	"EMB	32	35	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""EMB"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
There was a combined mean loss of 46% of fibers from the superior, inferior, and nasal quadrants in the ( six) eyes of all three subjects ( mean average thickness of 55 + / - 29 microm).	[]
In both sets ( four) of eyes of the subjects with persistent visual deficits ( patients B and C), there was an average loss of 79% of nerve fiber thickness in the temporal quadrant.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: The OCT results in these patients with EMB - induced optic neuropathy show considerable loss especially of the temporal fibers.	"EMB	52	55	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""EMB"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
This is consistent with prior histopathological studies that show predominant loss of parvo - cellular axons ( or small - caliber axons) within the papillo - macular bundle in toxic or hereditary optic neuropathies.	[]
OCT can be a valuable tool in the quantitative analysis of optic neuropathies.	[]
Additionally, in terms of management of EMB - induced optic neuropathy, it is important to properly manage ethambutol dosing in patients with renal impairment and to achieve proper transition to a maintenance dose once an appropriate loading dose has been reached.	"EMB	40	43	Chemical/Drug"	"ethambutol	107	117	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""EMB"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""ethambutol"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Hypoxia in renal disease with proteinuria and / or glomerular hypertension.	[]
Despite the increasing need to identify and quantify tissue oxygenation at the cellular level, relatively few methods have been available.	[]
In this study, we developed a new hypoxia - responsive reporter vector using a hypoxia - responsive element of the 5 ' vascular endothelial growth factor untranslated region and generated a novel hypoxia - sensing transgenic rat.	[]
We then applied this animal model to the detection of tubulointerstitial hypoxia in the diseased kidney.	[]
With this model, we were able to identify diffuse cortical hypoxia in the puromycin aminonucleoside - induced nephrotic syndrome and focal and segmental hypoxia in the remnant kidney model.	"puromycin aminonucleoside	74	99	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""puromycin aminonucleoside"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Expression of the hypoxia - responsive transgene increased throughout the observation period, reaching 2. 2 - fold at 2 weeks in the puromycin aminonucleoside model and 2. 6 - fold at 4 weeks in the remnant kidney model, whereas that of vascular endothelial growth factor showed a mild decrease, reflecting distinct behaviors of the two genes.	"puromycin aminonucleoside	133	158	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""puromycin aminonucleoside"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The degree of hypoxia showed a positive correlation with microscopic tubulointerstitial injury in both models.	[]
Finally, we identified the localization of proliferating cell nuclear antigen - positive, ED - 1 - positive, and terminal dUTP nick - end labeled - positive cells in the hypoxic cortical area in the remnant kidney model.	[]
We propose here a possible pathological tie between chronic tubulointerstitial hypoxia and progressive glomerular diseases.	[]

Because of ribavirin - related hemolytic anemia, dose reduction is a common event in this therapy.	"ribavirin	11	20	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ribavirin"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In this clinical retrospective cohort study we have examined the suitable timing of ribavirin reduction in patients with hemolysis during combination therapy.	"ribavirin	84	93	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ribavirin"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METHODS: Thirty - seven of 160 patients who had HCV - genotype 1b, had high virus load, and received 24 - week combination therapy developed anemia with hemoglobin level < 10 g / dl or anemia - related signs during therapy.	[]
After that, these 37 patients were reduced one tablet of ribavirin ( 200 mg) per day.	"ribavirin	57	66	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ribavirin"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
After reduction of ribavirin, 27 of 37 patients could continue combination therapy for a total of 24 weeks ( group A).	"ribavirin	19	28	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ribavirin"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
However, 10 of 37 patients with reduction of ribavirin could not continue combination therapy because their < 8. 5 g / dl hemoglobin values decreased to or anemia - related severe side effects occurred ( group B).	"ribavirin	45	54	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ribavirin"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We assessed the final efficacy and safety after reduction of ribavirin in groups A and B.	"ribavirin	61	70	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ribavirin"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
RESULTS: A sustained virological response ( SVR) was 29. 6% ( 8 / 27) in group A and 10% ( 1 / 10) in group B, respectively.	[]
A 34. 4% ( 12 / 27) of SVR + biological response in group A was higher than 10% ( 1 / 10) in group B ( P = 0. 051), with slight significance.	[]
With respect to hemoglobin level at the time of ribavirin reduction, a rate of continuation of therapy in patients with > or = 10 g / dl hemoglobin was higher than that in patients with < 10 g / dl ( P = 0. 036).	"ribavirin	48	57	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ribavirin"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Relation of perfusion defects observed with myocardial contrast echocardiography to the severity of coronary stenosis: correlation with thallium - 201 single - photon emission tomography.	"thallium	136	144	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""thallium"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
It has been previously shown that myocardial contrast echocardiography is a valuable technique for delineating regions of myocardial underperfusion secondary to coronary occlusion and to critical coronary stenoses in the presence of hyperemic stimulation.	[]
The aim of this study was to determine whether myocardial contrast echocardiography performed with a stable solution of sonicated albumin could detect regions of myocardial underperfusion resulting from various degrees of coronary stenosis.	[]
The perfusion defect produced in 16 open chest dogs was compared with the anatomic area at risk measured by the postmortem dual - perfusion technique and with thallium - 201 single - photon emission tomography ( SPECT).	"thallium	159	167	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""thallium"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 167, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
During a transient ( 20 - s) coronary occlusion, a perfusion defect was observed with contrast echocardiography in 14 of the 15 dogs in which the occlusion was produced.	[]
The perfusion defect correlated significantly with the anatomic area at risk ( r = 0. 74; p less than 0. 002).	[]
During dipyridamole - induced hyperemia, 12 of the 16 dogs with a partial coronary stenosis had a visible area of hypoperfusion by contrast echocardiography.	"dipyridamole	7	19	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dipyridamole"", ""start_span"": 7, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The four dogs without a perfusion defect had a stenosis that resulted in a mild ( 0% to 50%) reduction in dipyridamole - induced hyperemia.	"dipyridamole	106	118	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dipyridamole"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The size of the perfusion defect during stenosis correlated significantly with the anatomic area at risk ( r = 0. 61; p = 0. 02).	[]
Thallium - 201 SPECT demonstrated a perfusion defect in all 14 dogs analyzed during dipyridamole - induced hyperemia; the size of the perfusion defect correlated with the anatomic area at risk ( r = 0. 58; p less than 0. 03) and with the perfusion defect by contrast echocardiography ( r = 0. 58; p less than 0. 03).	"Thallium	0	8	Chemical/Drug"	"dipyridamole	84	96	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Thallium"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""dipyridamole"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Thus, myocardial contrast echocardiography can be used to visualize and quantitate the amount of jeopardized myocardium during moderate to severe degrees of coronary stenosis.	[]
The results obtained show a correlation with the anatomic area at risk similar to that obtained with thallium - 201 SPECT.	"thallium	101	109	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""thallium"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Microdialysis samples were collected preischemia, before IT injection, and at 2, 4, 8, 24, and 48 h of reperfusion ( after IT injection).	[]
Second, we investigated the effect of IT MK - 801 ( 30 mug) on the histopathologic changes in the spinal cord after morphine - induced spastic paraparesis.

This increase persisted for 8 hrs.	[]
IT MK - 801 significantly reduced the number of dark - stained alpha - motoneurons after morphine - induced spastic paraparesis compared with the saline group.

Likewise, in vivo, B6D2F1 mice were treated with etoposide, daunorubicin, and doxorubicin, with or without dexrazoxane over a wide range of doses: posttreatment, a full hematologic evaluation was done.	"etoposide	49	58	Chemical/Drug"	"daunorubicin	60	72	Chemical/Drug"	"doxorubicin	78	89	Chemical/Drug"	"dexrazoxane	107	118	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""etoposide"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""daunorubicin"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""doxorubicin"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""dexrazoxane"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
RESULTS: Nontoxic doses of dexrazoxane reduced myelosuppression and weight loss from daunorubicin and etoposide in mice and antagonized their antiproliferative effects in the colony assay; however, dexrazoxane neither reduced myelosuppression, weight loss, nor the in vitro cytotoxicity from doxorubicin.

CONCLUSION: Although our findings support the observation that dexrazoxane reduces neither hematologic activity nor antitumor activity from doxorubicin clinically, the potent antagonism of daunorubicin activity raises concern; a possible interference with anticancer efficacy certainly would call for renewed attention.

OBJECTIVES: To assess patients ' ability to repeat and recall words presented to them while undergoing procedural sedation with propofol, and correlate their recall with their level of awareness as measured by bispectral index ( BIS) monitoring.	"propofol	128	136	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""propofol"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METHODS: This was a prospective, single - intervention study of consenting adult patients undergoing procedural sedation with propofol between December 28, 2002, and October 31, 2003.	"propofol	126	134	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""propofol"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
BIS monitoring was initiated starting 3 minutes before the procedure and continuing until the patient had regained baseline mental status.	[]
At 1 - minute intervals during the procedural sedation, until the patient regained baseline mental status at the end of the procedure, a word from a standardized list was read aloud, and the patient was asked to immediately repeat the word to the investigator.	[]
The BIS score at the time the word was read and the patient ' s ability to repeat the word were recorded.	[]
After the procedure, the patient was asked to state all of the words from the list that he or she could recall, and to identify the last word recalled from prior to the start of the procedure and the first word recalled from after the procedure was completed.	[]
RESULTS: Seventy - five consenting patients were enrolled; one patient was excluded from data analysis for a protocol violation.	[]
No serious adverse events were noted during the procedural sedations.	[]
The mean ( + / - standard deviation) time of data collection was 16. 4 minutes ( + / - 7. 1; range 5 to 34 minutes).	[]
The mean initial ( preprocedure) BIS score was 97. 1 ( + / - 2. 3; range 92 to 99).	[]
The mean lowest BIS score occurring during these procedural sedations was 66. 9 ( + / - 14. 4; range 33 to 91).	[]
The mean lowest BIS score corresponding to the ability of the patient to immediately repeat words read from the list was 77. 1 ( 95% CI = 74. 3 to 80. 0).	[]
The mean highest BIS score corresponding to the inability to repeat words was 81. 5 ( 95% CI = 78. 1 to 84. 8).	[]
The mean BIS score corresponding to the last word recalled from prior to the initiation of the sedation was 96. 7 ( + / - 2. 4; range 84 to 98).	[]
The mean BIS score corresponding to the first word recalled after the procedure was completed was 91. 2 ( 95% CI = 88. 1 to 94. 3).	[]
All patients recalled at least one word that had been read to them during the protocol.	[]
The mean lowest BIS score for any recalled word was 91. 5 ( + / - 11. 1; range 79 to 98), and no words were recalled when the corresponding BIS score was less than 90.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: There is a range of BIS scores during which sedated patients are able to repeat words read to them but are not able to subsequently recall these words.	[]
Furthermore, patients had no recall of words repeated prior to procedural sedation in BIS ranges associated with recall after procedural sedation, suggestive of retrograde amnesia.	[]

No organic cause of hiccups was identified despite extensive investigation.	[]
DISCUSSION: Pharmacotherapeutic agents have been uncommonly associated with hiccups.	[]
Corticosteroids ( dexamethasone and methylprednisolone), benzodiazepines ( midazolam) and general anaesthesia have been the specific agents mentioned most frequently in the literature as being associated with the development of hiccups.

Few cases of drug - induced hiccups have been reported related to macrolide antimicrobials.	"macrolide	66	75	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""macrolide"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Using the Naranjo adverse effect reaction probability scale this event could be classified as possible ( score 5 points), mostly because of the close temporal sequence, previous reports on this reaction with other macrolides and the absence of any alternative explanation for hiccups.	"macrolides	214	224	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""macrolides"", ""start_span"": 214, ""end_span"": 224, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Our hypothesis is that a vagal mechanism mediated by azithromycin could be the pathogenesis of hiccups in our patient.	"azithromycin	53	65	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""azithromycin"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of drug - induced hiccups is difficult and often achieved only by a process of elimination.	[]
However, macrolide antimicrobials have been reported to be associated with hiccups and vagal mechanism could explain the development of this side - effect.	"macrolide	9	18	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""macrolide"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

OBJECTIVE: To describe 3 patients with calcium carbonate - induced hypercalcemia and gain insights into the cause and management of the milk - alkali syndrome.	"calcium carbonate	39	56	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""calcium carbonate"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METHODS: We report the clinical and laboratory data in 3 patients who presented with severe hypercalcemia ( corrected serum calcium > or = 14 mg / dL) and review the pertinent literature on milk - alkali syndrome.	"calcium	124	131	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""calcium"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
RESULTS: The 3 patients had acute renal insufficiency, relative metabolic alkalosis, and low parathyroid hormone ( PTH), PTH - related peptide, and 1, 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations.	[]
No malignant lesion was found.	[]
Treatment included aggressive hydration and varied amounts of furosemide.	"furosemide	62	72	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""furosemide"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The 2 patients with the higher serum calcium concentrations received pamidronate intravenously ( 60 and 30 mg, respectively), which caused severe hypocalcemia.

In addition to our highlighted cases, we review the history, classification, pathophysiologic features, and treatment of milk - alkali syndrome and summarize the cases reported from early 1995 to November 2003.	[]
CONCLUSION: Milk - alkali syndrome may be a common cause of unexplained hypercalcemia and can be precipitated by small amounts of orally ingested calcium carbonate in susceptible persons.

Cocaine - induced brainstem seizures and behavior.	"Cocaine	0	7	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Cocaine"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
A variety of abnormal sensory / motor behaviors associated with electrical discharges recorded from the bilateral brainstem were induced in adult WKY rats by mechanical ( electrode implants) and DC electrical current stimulations and by acute and chronic administration of cocaine.	"cocaine	273	280	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cocaine"", ""start_span"": 273, ""end_span"": 280, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The electrode implant implicated one side or the other of the reticular system of the brainstem but subjects were not incapacitated by the stimulations.	[]
Cocaine ( 40 mg / kg) was injected subcutaneously for an acute experiment and subsequent 20 mg / kg doses twice daily for 3 days in a chronic study.	"Cocaine	0	7	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Cocaine"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Cocaine generated more abnormal behaviors in the brainstem perturbation group, especially the electrically perturbated subjects.	"Cocaine	0	7	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Cocaine"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
"The abnormal behaviors were yawning, retrocollis, hyperactivity, hypersensitivity, "" beating drum "" behavior, squealing, head bobbing, circling, sniffing, abnormal posturing, and facial twitching."	[]
Shifts in the power frequency spectra of the discharge patterns were noted between quiet and pacing behavioral states.	[]
Hypersensitivity to various auditory, tactile, and visual stimulation was present and shifts in the brainstem ambient power spectral frequency occurred in response to tactile stimulation.	[]
These findings suggest that the brainstem generates and propagates pathological discharges that can be elicited by mechanical and DC electrical perturbation.	[]
Cocaine was found to activate the discharge system and thus induce abnormal behaviors that are generated at the discharge site and at distant sites to which the discharge propagates.	"Cocaine	0	7	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Cocaine"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Cognitive functions may also be involved since dopaminergic and serotonergic cellular elements at the brainstem level are also implicated.	[]

Human malignant brain tumors have a poor prognosis in spite of surgery and radiation therapy.	[]
Cubic phases consist of curved biocontinuous lipid bilayers, separating two congruent networks of water channels.	[]
Used as a host for cytotoxic drugs, the gel - like matrix can easily be applied to the walls of a surgical resection cavity.	[]
For human glioblastoma recurrences, the feasibility, safety, and short - term effects of a surgical intracavitary application of paclitaxel and carboplatin encapsulated by liquid crystalline cubic phases are examined in a pilot study.

Information on these effects could be obtained from angiograms of patients with cocaine - associated subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH) who underwent angiography shortly after cocaine use.	"cocaine	80	87	Chemical/Drug"	"cocaine	80	87	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cocaine"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""cocaine"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METHODS: We screened patients with SAH retrospectively and identified those with positive urine toxicology for cocaine or its metabolites.	"cocaine	111	118	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cocaine"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Quantitative arterial diameter measurements from angiograms of these patients were compared to measurements from control patients with SAH who were matched for factors known to influence arterial diameter.	[]
Qualitative comparisons of small artery changes also were made.	[]

There were no significant differences between groups in the mean diameters of the intradural internal carotid, sphenoidal segment of the middle cerebral, precommunicating segment of the anterior cerebral, or basilar arteries ( p greater than 0. 05 for all comparisons, unpaired t - tests).	[]
There also were no significant differences between groups when expressing diameters as the sum of the precommunicating segment of the anterior cerebral + sphenoidal segment of the middle cerebral + supraclinoid internal carotid artery + basilar artery divided by the diameter of the petrous internal carotid artery ( p greater than 0. 05, unpaired t - tests).

Control ( saline P20) rats acquired both discriminations immediately.	[]
In status epilepticus ( P20) rats, acquisition of the sound - source location discrimination was moderately impaired.	[]
Status epilepticus ( P45) rats failed to acquire either sound - source location or sound - silence discriminations.	[]
Status epilepticus in rat causes an age - dependent, long - term impairment in auditory discrimination.	[]

Definition and management of anemia in patients infected with hepatitis C virus.	[]
Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus ( HCV) can progress to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and end - stage liver disease.	[]
The current best treatment for HCV infection is combination therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin.	"interferon	83	93	Chemical/Drug"	"ribavirin	98	107	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""interferon"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""ribavirin"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Although this regimen produces sustained virologic responses ( SVRs) in approximately 50% of patients, it can be associated with a potentially dose - limiting hemolytic anemia.	[]
Hemoglobin concentrations decrease mainly as a result of ribavirin - induced hemolysis, and this anemia can be problematic in patients with HCV infection, especially those who have comorbid renal or cardiovascular disorders.	"ribavirin	57	66	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ribavirin"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In general, anemia can increase the risk of morbidity and mortality, and may have negative effects on cerebral function and quality of life.	[]
Although ribavirin - associated anemia can be reversed by dose reduction or discontinuation, this approach compromises outcomes by significantly decreasing SVR rates.	"ribavirin	9	18	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ribavirin"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

BACKGROUND: More than 3 decades after Jones and Smith ( 1973) reported on the devastation caused by alcohol exposure on fetal development, the rates of heavy drinking during pregnancy remain relatively unchanged.	"alcohol	100	107	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""alcohol"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Early identification of fetal alcohol exposure and maternal abstinence led to better infant outcomes.	"alcohol	30	37	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""alcohol"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
This study examined the utility of biometry for detecting alcohol - related fetal growth impairment.	"alcohol	58	65	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""alcohol"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METHODS: We obtained fetal ultrasound measures from routine ultrasound examinations for 167 pregnant hazardous drinkers who were enrolled in a brief alcohol intervention study.	"alcohol	149	156	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""alcohol"", ""start_span"": 149, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The fetal measures for women who quit after learning of their pregnancies were compared with measures for women who continued some drinking throughout the course of their pregnancies.	[]
Because intensity of alcohol consumption is associated with poorer fetal outcomes, separate analyses were conducted for the heavy ( average of > or = 5 drinks per drinking day) alcohol consumers.	"alcohol	21	28	Chemical/Drug"	"alcohol	21	28	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""alcohol"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""alcohol"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Fetal measures from the heavy - exposed fetuses were also compared with measures from a nondrinking group that was representative of normal, uncomplicated pregnancies from our clinics.	[]
Analyses of covariance were used to determine whether there were differences between groups after controlling for influences of gestational age and drug abuse.	[]
RESULTS: Nearly half of the pregnant drinkers abstained after learning of their pregnancies.	[]
When women reportedly quit drinking early in their pregnancies, fetal growth measures were not significantly different from a non - alcohol - exposed group, regardless of prior drinking patterns.	"alcohol	132	139	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""alcohol"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Any alcohol consumption postpregnancy recognition among the heavy drinkers resulted in reduced cerebellar growth as well as decreased cranial to body growth in comparison with women who either quit drinking or who were nondrinkers.	"alcohol	4	11	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""alcohol"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Amphetamine abuse was predictive of larger cranial to body growth ratios.	"Amphetamine	0	11	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Amphetamine"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
CONCLUSIONS: Alterations in fetal biometric measurements were observed among the heavy drinkers only when they continued drinking after becoming aware of their pregnancies.	[]
Although the reliance on self - reported drinking is a limitation in this study, these findings support the benefits of early abstinence and the potential for ultrasound examinations in the detection of fetal alcohol effects.

All 3 patients had loss of central visual acuity, colour vision ( Ishihara) and visual field.	[]
The visual field loss had a bitemporal flavour, suggesting involvement of the optic chiasm.	[]
TREATMENT: Despite stopping ethambutol on diagnosis, visual function continued to deteriorate for a few months.	"ethambutol	28	38	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ethambutol"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Subsequent improvement was mild in 2 cases.	[]
In the third case, visual acuity and colour vision normalised but the optic discs were pale.	[]
OUTCOME: All 3 patients had some permanent loss of visual function.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: Ethambutol usage is associated with permanent visual loss and should be avoided if possible or used with caution and proper ophthalmological follow - up.	"Ethambutol	13	23	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Ethambutol"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

7 days later, the fever disappeared and the patient ' s serum CPK levels were normalized ( 175 IU / L).	[]
This patient presented with symptoms of neuroleptic malignant syndrome ( NMS), thus demonstrating that NMS - like symptoms can occur after combined paroxetine and alprazolam treatment.

The adverse drug reaction score obtained by the Naranjo algorithm was 6 in our case, indicating a probable relationship between the patient ' s NMS - like adverse symptoms and the combined treatment used in this case.	[]
The involvement of physiologic and environmental aspects specific to this patient was suspected.	[]
Several risk factors for NMS should be noted in elderly depressive patients whose symptoms often include dehydration, agitation, malnutrition, and exhaustion.	[]

In the control group ( n = 7), the mean arterial pressure ( MAP) was not manipulated.	[]
In the hypertensive group ( n = 7), the MAP was elevated by 25 - 30 mm Hg beginning 2 h after MCAO.	[]
Four hours after MCAO, the rats were killed and the brains harvested.	[]
The brains were sectioned along coronal planes spanning the distribution of ischemia produced by MCAO.	[]
Specific gravity ( SG) was determined in the subcortex and in two sites in the cortex ( core and periphery of the ischemic territory).	[]
The extent of neuronal injury was determined by 2, 3, 5 - triphenyltetrazolium staining.	[]
In the ischemic core, there was no difference in SG in the subcortex and cortex in the two groups.	[]
In the periphery of the ischemic territory, SG in the cortex was greater ( less edema accumulation) in the hypertensive group ( 1. 041 + / - 0. 001 vs 1. 039 + / - 0. 001, P less than 0. 05).	[]
The area of histochemical injury ( as a percent of the cross - sectional area of the hemisphere) was less in the hypertensive group ( 33 + / - 3% vs 21 + / - 2%, P less than 0. 05).	[]
The data indicate that phenylephrine - induced hypertension instituted 2 h after MCAO does not aggravate edema in the ischemic core, that it improves edema in the periphery of the ischemic territory, and that it reduces the area of histochemical neuronal dysfunction.

METHODS: We reviewed the medical literature for single reports and case series of patients presenting with stroke - like episodes while receiving systemic or intrathecal chemotherapy.	[]
We only included studies providing detailed neuroimaging data.	[]
Patients with cerebrovascular accidents were excluded.	[]
RESULTS: We identified 27 reports of toxic leukoencephalopathy in patients treated with methotrexate ( intrathecal, systemic), 5 - fluorouracil and its derivative carmofur, and capecitabine.

Diffusion weighted imaging ( DWI) of all patients revealed well demarcated hyperintense lesions within the subcortical white matter of the cerebral hemispheres and the corpus callosum, corresponding to areas of decreased proton diffusion on apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC) maps ( available in 21 / 27 patients).	[]
Lesions exceeded the confines of adjacent vascular territories.	[]
Complete resolution of symptoms within 1 - 4 days was accompanied by normalisation of ADC abnormalities.	[]
However, fluid attenuated inversion recovery ( FLAIR) sequences frequently revealed persistent white matter abnormalities.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: Several pathophysiological models of delayed leukoencephalopathy after exposure to intrathecal or systemic chemotherapy have been proposed.	[]
DWI findings in this cohort are indicative of cytotoxic oedema within cerebral white matter and lend support to an at least partially reversible metabolic derangement as the basis for this syndrome.	[]

DESIGN: Pooled data from 3 multicenter, double - masked, randomized, controlled, phase 2b / 3 clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of the 0. 59 - mg or 2. 1 - mg FA intravitreal implant or standard therapy were analyzed.	"FA	176	178	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""FA"", ""start_span"": 176, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
RESULTS: During the 3 - year follow - up, 71. 0% of implanted eyes had an IOP increase of 10 mm Hg or more than baseline and 55. 1%, 24. 7%, and 6. 2% of eyes reached an IOP of 30 mm Hg or more, 40 mm Hg or more, and 50 mm Hg or more, respectively.	[]
Topical IOP - lowering medication was administered in 74. 8% of implanted eyes, and IOP - lowering surgeries, most of which were trabeculectomies ( 76. 2%), were performed on 36. 6% of implanted eyes.	[]
Intraocular pressure - lowering surgeries were considered a success ( postoperative IOP of 6 - 21 mm Hg with or without additional IOP - lowering medication) in 85. 1% of eyes at 1 year.	[]
The rate of hypotony ( IOP < / = 5 mm Hg) following IOP - lowering surgery ( 42. 5%) was not different from that of implanted eyes not subjected to surgery ( 35. 4%) ( P =. 09).	[]
CONCLUSION: Elevated IOP is a significant complication with the FA intravitreal implant but may be controlled with medication and surgery.	[]
Myocardial Fas ligand expression increases susceptibility to AZT - induced cardiomyopathy.	"AZT	61	64	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""AZT"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
BACKGROUND: Dilated cardiomyopathy ( DCM) and myocarditis occur in many HIV - infected individuals, resulting in symptomatic heart failure in up to 5% of patients.	[]
Highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART) has significantly reduced morbidity and mortality of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS), but has resulted in an increase in cardiac and skeletal myopathies.	[]
METHODS AND RESULTS: In order to investigate whether the HAART component zidovudine ( 3 ' - azido - 2 ', 3 ' - deoxythymidine; AZT) triggers the Fas - dependent cell - death pathway and cause cytoskeletal disruption in a murine model of DCM, 8 - week - old transgenic ( expressing Fas ligand in the myocardium: FasL Tg) and non - transgenic ( NTg) mice received water ad libitum containing different concentrations of AZT ( 0, 0. 07, 0. 2, and 0. 7 mg / ml).

After 6 weeks, cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography and morphology was assessed by histopathologic and immunohistochemical methods.	[]
NTg and untreated FasL Tg mice showed little or no change in cardiac structure or function.	[]
In contrast, AZT - treated FasL Tg mice developed cardiac dilation and depressed cardiac function in a dose - dependent manner, with concomitant inflammatory infiltration of both ventricles.	"AZT	13	16	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""AZT"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
These changes were associated with an increased sarcolemmal expression of Fas and FasL, as well as increased activation of caspase 3, translocation of calpain 1 to the sarcolemma and sarcomere, and increased numbers of cells undergoing apoptosis.	[]
These were associated with changes in dystrophin and cardiac troponin I localization, as well as loss of sarcolemmal integrity.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: The expression of Fas ligand in the myocardium, as identified in HIV - positive patients, might increase the susceptibility to HAART - induced cardiomyopathy due to activation of apoptotic pathways, resulting in cardiac dilation and dysfunction.	[]

METHODS: This comparative, Phase III, 12 - week, multicenter, prospective, randomized, double - blind study was conducted in Indian patients aged 18 to 65 years with established stage II hypertension.	[]
Patients were treated with oral FDC of T + A or A QD before breakfast for 12 weeks; blood pressure ( BP) and heart rate were measured in the sitting position.	[]
Primary efficacy end points were reduction in clinical systolic BP ( SBP) / diastolic BP ( DBP) from baseline to study end and number of responders ( ie, patients who achieved target SBP / DBP < 130 / < 80 mm Hg) at end of study.	[]
Tolerability was assessed by treatment - emergent adverse events, identified using physical examination, laboratory analysis, and electrocardiography.	[]
RESULTS: A total of 210 patients were enrolled in the study; 203 patients ( 143 men, 60 women) completed the study while 7 were lost to follow - up ( 4 patients in the T + A group and 3 in the A group) and considered with - drawn.	[]
At study end, statistically significant percentage reductions from baseline within groups and between groups were observed in SBP ( T + A [ - 27. 4%]; A [ - 16. 6%]) and DBP ( T + A [ - 20. 1%]; A [ - 13. 3%]) ( all, P < 0. 05).	[]
Response rates were 87. 3% ( 89 / 102) in the T + A group and 69. 3% ( 70 / 101) in the A group ( P < 0. 05).	[]
The prevalences of adverse events were not significantly different between the 2 treatment groups ( T + A, 16. 0% [ 17 / 106]; A, 15. 4% [ 16 / 104]).	[]
Peripheral edema was reported in 8. 5% patients ( 9 / 106) in the T + A group compared with 13. 5% ( 14 / 104) in the A group, and cough was reported in 3. 8% patients ( 4 / 106) in the T + A group and 1. 0% ( 1 / 104) patients in the A group; these differences did not reach statistical significance.	[]
The incidences of headache, dizziness, and diarrhea were similar between the 2 groups.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: Among these Indian patients with stage II hypertension, the FDC of T + A was found to be significantly more effective, with regard to BP reductions, than A, and both treatments were well tolerated.	[]

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The 32 men and 20 women underwent living donor liver transplantation.	[]
We started LMWH ( 25 IU / kg / h) on postoperative day ( POD) 1, switching to UFH ( 5000 U / d) on POD 2 or 3.	"UFH	78	81	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""UFH"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The dose of UFH was changed according to the activated clotting time level.	"UFH	12	15	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""UFH"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
HIT antibody levels were measured the day before surgery and on POD 7 and 14.	[]
Platelet count was measured daily for 3 weeks.	[]
RESULTS: The average platelet counts preoperatively, and on POD 7, 14, and 21 were 65, 88, 149, and 169 x 10 ( 9) / L, respectively.	[]
Two patients developed hepatic artery thrombosis on POD 11 and 19, respectively, although they were HIT antibody - negative and their platelet counts were stable.	[]
In 2 other patients, the platelet count decreased suddenly from 107 x 10 ( 9) / L on POD 4 to 65 x 10 ( 9) / L on POD 6 and from 76 x 10 ( 9) / L on POD 7 to 33 x 10 ( 9) / L on POD 9, respectively.	[]

This was associated with a reduced activation state of AKT, as well as an increased bax / bcl2 ratio in Western blots, indicating cardiac apoptosis.	[]
Furthermore, mRNA levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 were increased in the cardiac tissue.	[]
In DOX B1R ( - / -) mice, cardiac dysfunction was improved compared to DOX control mice, which was associated with normalization of the bax / bcl - 2 ratio and interleukin 6, as well as AKT activation state.

Spectral analyses were conducted by dividing the whole spectrum into different frequency bands including delta, theta ( slow and fast), alpha - sigma, beta ( 1 and 2) and gamma ( 1 and 2) bands.	[]
Our results show that the most affected frequency bands were delta, theta, beta - 2 and gamma - 2 bands during the epileptiform activity and there were marked differences in terms of spectral densities between three investigated episodes ( basal activity, latent period and epileptiform activity).

Severe alterations in the structural integrity of the sarcolemma of cardiomyocytes have been demonstrated to be caused by isoproterenol.	"isoproterenol	122	135	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""isoproterenol"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Taking into account that the sarcolemmal integrity is stabilized by the dystrophin - glycoprotein complex ( DGC) that connects actin and laminin in contractile machinery and extracellular matrix and by integrins, this study tests the hypothesis that isoproterenol affects sarcolemmal stability through changes in the DGC and integrins.	"isoproterenol	250	263	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""isoproterenol"", ""start_span"": 250, ""end_span"": 263, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Immunofluorescent staining revealed that dystrophin is the most sensitive among the structures connecting the actin in the cardiomyocyte cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix.	[]
The sarcomeric actin dissolution occurred after the reduction or loss of dystrophin.	[]
Subsequently, after lysis of myofilaments, gamma - sarcoglycan, beta - dystroglycan, beta1 - integrin, and laminin alpha - 2 expressions were reduced followed by their breakdown, as epiphenomena of the myocytolytic process.	[]
In conclusion, administration of isoproterenol to rats results in primary loss of dystrophin, the most sensitive among the structural proteins that form the DGC that connects the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton in cardiomyocyte.

A phase I trial of a 14 - day cycle.	[]

Dose escalations proceeded from 200 to 300, 400, 450, 500, and 550 mg / m2 / d.	[]
Four patients developed transient microscopic hematuria at 400, 450, and 500 mg / m2 / d.	[]
There were no instances of macroscopic hematuria.	[]
At 550 mg / m2 / d, three patients experienced nonurologic toxicity; confusion ( 1), nausea ( 1), and Grade 2 leukopenia ( 1).	[]
The recommended dose of 500 mg / m2 / d delivers a total dose of 7 g / m2 per cycle, which is comparable to that delivered in clinical practice for bolus or short - term infusion.	[]
Because few patients received multiple courses over time, the cumulative effects are indeterminate in the present trial.	[]
The frequency and predictability of hematuria are not precise, and at least daily monitoring by urine Hematest is essential, adding Mesna to the infusate in patients with persistent hematuria.	"Mesna	132	137	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Mesna"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

BACKGROUND: It is not known if there is a relationship between input rate and incidence of bupropion - induced seizures.	"bupropion	91	100	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""bupropion"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

METHODS: We investigated the effect of varying the intraperitoneal infusion rates of bupropion HCl 120 mg / kg, a known convulsive dose 50 ( CD50), on the incidence and severity of bupropion - induced convulsions in the Swiss albino mice.	"bupropion HCl	85	98	Chemical/Drug"	"bupropion	85	94	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""bupropion HCl"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""bupropion"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
A total of 69 mice, approximately 7 weeks of age, and weighing 21. 0 to 29. 1 g were randomly assigned to bupropion HCl 120 mg / kg treatment by intraperitoneal ( IP) administration in 7 groups ( 9 to 10 animals per group).	"bupropion HCl	106	119	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""bupropion HCl"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Bupropion HCl was infused through a surgically implanted IP dosing catheter with infusions in each group of 0 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 120 min, and 240 min.	"Bupropion HCl	0	13	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Bupropion HCl"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The number, time of onset, duration and the intensity of the convulsions or absence of convulsions were recorded.	[]
RESULTS: The results showed that IP administration of bupropion HCl 120 mg / kg by bolus injection induced convulsions in 6 out of 10 mice ( 60% of convulsing mice) in group 1.	"bupropion HCl	54	67	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""bupropion HCl"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Logistic regression analysis revealed that infusion time was significant ( p = 0. 0004; odds ratio = 0. 974) and increasing the IP infusion time of bupropion HCl 120 mg / kg was associated with a 91% reduced odds of convulsions at infusion times of 15 to 90 min compared to bolus injection.	"bupropion HCl	148	161	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""bupropion HCl"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Further increase in infusion time resulted in further reduction in the odds of convulsions to 99. 8% reduction at 240 min.	[]
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the demonstration of an inverse relationship between infusion time of a fixed and convulsive dose of bupropion and the risk of convulsions in a prospective study is novel.

All patients engrafted, and only 1 patient experienced grade IV mucositis.	[]
Nine patients ( 37%) developed acute grade II - IV GVHD, and 11 of 17 evaluable patients ( 64%) developed chronic extensive GVHD.	[]
Transplantation - associated microangiopathy ( TMA) occurred in 7 patients ( 29%), with 2 cases of acute renal failure.	[]
The study was terminated prematurely because an additional 6 patients ( 25%) developed sinusoidal obstruction syndrome ( SOS), which was fatal in 2 cases.	[]

Cardiotoxicity is not an uncommon adverse effect of chemotherapeutic agents.	[]
However, there are no reports of ABS secondary to chemotherapeutic agents.	[]
We describe the case of a woman who developed the syndrome after chemotherapy for metastatic cancer.	[]
A 79 - year - old woman presented with typical ischemic chest pain, elevated cardiac enzymes with significant ST - segment abnormalities on her electrocardiogram.	[]

Long term hormone therapy for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.	[]
BACKGROUND: Hormone therapy ( HT) is widely used for controlling menopausal symptoms and has also been used for the management and prevention of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and dementia in older women.	[]
This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review first published in 2005.	[]
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of long - term HT on mortality, cardiovascular outcomes, cancer, gallbladder disease, cognition, fractures and quality of life.	[]
SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the following databases to November 2007: Trials Register of the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biological Abstracts.	[]
Also relevant non - indexed journals and conference abstracts.	[]
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised double - blind trials of HT versus placebo, taken for at least one year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women.	[]
HT included oestrogens, with or without progestogens, via oral, transdermal, subcutaneous or transnasal routes.	"oestrogens	12	22	Chemical/Drug"	"progestogens	40	52	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""oestrogens"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""progestogens"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.	[]
MAIN RESULTS: Nineteen trials involving 41, 904 women were included.	[]
In relatively healthy women, combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo - embolism or coronary event ( after one year ' s use), stroke ( after three years), breast cancer and gallbladder disease.	[]
Long - term oestrogen - only HT significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo - embolism, stroke and gallbladder disease ( after one to two years, three years and seven years ' use respectively), but did not significantly increase the risk of breast cancer.	"oestrogen	12	21	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""oestrogen"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The only statistically significant benefits of HT were a decreased incidence of fractures and ( for combined HT) colon cancer, with long - term use.	[]
Among women aged over 65 who were relatively healthy ( i. e. generally fit, without overt disease) and taking continuous combined HT, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of dementia.	[]
Among women with cardiovascular disease, long - term use of combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo - embolism. One trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy 50 to 59 year old women taking combined continuous HT and 1637 taking oestrogen - only HT, versus similar - sized placebo groups.	"oestrogen	272	281	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""oestrogen"", ""start_span"": 272, ""end_span"": 281, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The only significantly increased risk reported was for venous thrombo - embolism in women taking combined continuous HT: their absolute risk remained low, at less than 1 / 500.	[]
However, this study was not powered to detect differences between groups of younger women.	[]
AUTHORS ' CONCLUSIONS: HT is not indicated for the routine management of chronic disease.	[]
We need more evidence on the safety of HT for menopausal symptom control, though short - term use appears to be relatively safe for healthy younger women.	[]

BACKGROUND: In 2 separate centers, we observed a notable increase in the incidence of postoperative convulsive seizures from 1. 3% to 3. 8% in patients having undergone major cardiac surgical procedures.	[]
These events were temporally coincident with the initial use of high - dose tranexamic acid ( TXA) therapy after withdrawal of aprotinin from general clinical usage.

METHODS: An in - depth chart review was undertaken in all 24 patients who developed perioperative seizures.	[]
Electroencephalographic activity was recorded in 11 of these patients, and all patients had a formal neurological evaluation and brain imaging studies.	[]
RESULTS: Twenty - one of the 24 patients did not have evidence of new cerebral ischemic injury, but seizures were likely due to ischemic brain injury in 3 patients.	[]
All patients with seizures did not have permanent neurological abnormalities.	[]
All 24 patients with seizures received high doses of TXA intraoperatively ranging from 61 to 259 mg / kg, had a mean age of 69. 9 years, and 21 of 24 had undergone open chamber rather than coronary bypass procedures.

Sedation depth during spinal anesthesia and the development of postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture repair.	[]
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether limiting intraoperative sedation depth during spinal anesthesia for hip fracture repair in elderly patients can decrease the prevalence of postoperative delirium.	[]
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a double - blind, randomized controlled trial at an academic medical center of elderly patients ( > or = 65 years) without preoperative delirium or severe dementia who underwent hip fracture repair under spinal anesthesia with propofol sedation.	"propofol	262	270	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""propofol"", ""start_span"": 262, ""end_span"": 270, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Sedation depth was titrated using processed electroencephalography with the bispectral index ( BIS), and patients were randomized to receive either deep ( BIS, approximately 50) or light ( BIS, > or = 80) sedation.	[]
Postoperative delirium was assessed as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( Third Edition Revised) criteria using the Confusion Assessment Method beginning at any time from the second day after surgery.	[]
RESULTS: From April 2, 2005, through October 30, 2008, a total of 114 patients were randomized.	[]
The prevalence of postoperative delirium was significantly lower in the light sedation group ( 11 / 57 [ 19%] vs 23 / 57 [ 40%] in the deep sedation group; P =. 02), indicating that 1 incident of delirium will be prevented for every 4. 7 patients treated with light sedation.	[]
The mean + / - SD number of days of delirium during hospitalization was lower in the light sedation group than in the deep sedation group ( 0. 5 + / - 1. 5 days vs 1. 4 + / - 4. 0 days; P =. 01).	[]
CONCLUSION: The use of light propofol sedation decreased the prevalence of postoperative delirium by 50% compared with deep sedation.	"propofol	29	37	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""propofol"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

OBJECTIVE: Diabetic nephropathy is one of the major causes of renal failure, which is accompanied by the production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS).	"oxygen	128	134	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""oxygen"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Nrf2 is the primary transcription factor that controls the antioxidant response essential for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis.	[]
Here, we report our findings demonstrating a protective role of Nrf2 against diabetic nephropathy.	[]
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We explore the protective role of Nrf2 against diabetic nephropathy using human kidney biopsy tissues from diabetic nephropathy patients, a streptozotocin - induced diabetic nephropathy model in Nrf2 ( - / -) mice, and cultured human mesangial cells.	"streptozotocin	169	183	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""streptozotocin"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 183, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
RESULTS: The glomeruli of human diabetic nephropathy patients were under oxidative stress and had elevated Nrf2 levels.	[]
In the animal study, Nrf2 was demonstrated to be crucial in ameliorating streptozotocin - induced renal damage.	"streptozotocin	73	87	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""streptozotocin"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
This is evident by Nrf2 ( - / -) mice having higher ROS production and suffering from greater oxidative DNA damage and renal injury compared with Nrf2 ( + / +) mice.	[]
Mechanistic studies in both in vivo and in vitro systems showed that the Nrf2 - mediated protection against diabetic nephropathy is, at least, partially through inhibition of transforming growth factor - beta1 ( TGF - beta1) and reduction of extracellular matrix production.	[]
In human renal mesangial cells, high glucose induced ROS production and activated expression of Nrf2 and its downstream genes.	"glucose	37	44	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""glucose"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Furthermore, activation or overexpression of Nrf2 inhibited the promoter activity of TGF - beta1 in a dose - dependent manner, whereas knockdown of Nrf2 by siRNA enhanced TGF - beta1 transcription and fibronectin production.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: This work clearly indicates a protective role of Nrf2 in diabetic nephropathy, suggesting that dietary or therapeutic activation of Nrf2 could be used as a strategy to prevent or slow down the progression of diabetic nephropathy.	[]

Risk of renal failure, Injury to the kidney, Failure of kidney function, Loss of kidney function, and End - stage renal damage ( RIFLE criteria) were used to define CIN and its incidence in the study population.	[]
Accordingly, among the 15 CIN patients ( 18. 75%), 7. 5% of the patients in group A had increased risk and 3. 75% had renal injury, whereas 5% of group B had increased risk and 2. 5% had renal injury.	[]
Whereas 33. 3% of the patients with CIN were among those who received the proper dosage of CM, the percentage increased to 66. 6% among those who received larger doses, with a significant difference in the incidence of CIN related to the different dosages of CM ( p = 0. 014).

Hypotension was induced for 236. 9 + / - 15. 1 min by increasing the isoflurane inspired concentration to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 59. 8 + / - 0. 4 mmHg.	"isoflurane	69	79	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""isoflurane"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
GFR and ERPF decreased with the induction of anesthesia but not significantly more during hypotension.	[]

METHOD: Medically healthy 7 - to 17 - year - old males chronically treated, in a naturalistic setting, with risperidone were recruited for this cross - sectional study through child psychiatry outpatient clinics between November 2005 and June 2007.

Volumetric BMD of the ultradistal radius was measured using peripheral quantitative computed tomography, and areal BMD of the lumbar spine was estimated using dual - energy x - ray absorptiometry.	[]
RESULTS: Hyperprolactinemia was present in 49% of 83 boys ( n = 41) treated with risperidone for a mean of 2. 9 years.	"risperidone	81	92	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""risperidone"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

As expected, bone mineral content and BMD increased with sexual maturity.	[]
After adjusting for the stage of sexual development and height and BMI z scores, serum prolactin was negatively associated with trabecular volumetric BMD at the ultradistal radius ( P <. 03).	[]
Controlling for relevant covariates, we also found treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs) to be associated with lower trabecular BMD at the radius ( P =. 03) and BMD z score at the lumbar spine ( P <. 05).

Fear - potentiated startle, but not light - enhanced startle, is enhanced by anxiogenic drugs.	[]
RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The light - enhanced startle paradigm ( LES) is suggested to model anxiety, because of the non - specific cue and the long - term effect.	[]
In contrast, the fear - potentiated startle ( FPS) is suggested to model conditioned fear.	[]
However, the pharmacological profiles of these two paradigms are very similar.	[]
The present study investigated the effects of putative anxiogenic drugs on LES and FPS and aimed at determining the sensitivity of LES for anxiogenic drugs and to potentially showing a pharmacological differentiation between these two paradigms.	[]
METHODS: Male Wistar rats received each dose of the alpha ( 2) - adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine ( 0. 25 - 1. 0mg / kg), the 5 - HT ( 2C) receptor agonist m - chlorophenylpiperazine ( mCPP, 0. 5 - 2. 0mg / kg) or the GABA ( A) inverse receptor agonist pentylenetetrazole ( PTZ, 3 - 30mg / kg) and were subsequently tested in either LES or FPS.

CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to findings in the FPS paradigm, none of the drugs were able to exacerbate the LES response.	[]
Thus, a clear pharmacological differentiation was found between LES and FPS.	[]

Dopamine is not essential for the development of methamphetamine - induced neurotoxicity.

It is widely believed that dopamine ( DA) mediates methamphetamine ( METH) - induced toxicity to brain dopaminergic neurons, because drugs that interfere with DA neurotransmission decrease toxicity, whereas drugs that increase DA neurotransmission enhance toxicity.	"dopamine	27	35	Chemical/Drug"	"DA	38	40	Chemical/Drug"	"methamphetamine	51	66	Chemical/Drug"	"METH	69	73	Chemical/Drug"	"DA	38	40	Chemical/Drug"	"DA	38	40	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dopamine"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""DA"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""methamphetamine"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""METH"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""DA"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""DA"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
However, temperature effects of drugs that have been used to manipulate brain DA neurotransmission confound interpretation of the data.	"DA	78	80	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""DA"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Here we show that the recently reported ability of L - dihydroxyphenylalanine to reverse the protective effect of alpha - methyl - para - tyrosine on METH - induced DA neurotoxicity is also confounded by drug effects on body temperature.

Further, we show that mice genetically engineered to be deficient in brain DA develop METH neurotoxicity, as long as the thermic effects of METH are preserved.	"DA	75	77	Chemical/Drug"	"METH	86	90	Chemical/Drug"	"METH	86	90	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""DA"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""METH"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""METH"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In addition, we demonstrate that mice genetically engineered to have unilateral brain DA deficits develop METH - induced dopaminergic deficits that are of comparable magnitude on both sides of the brain.	"DA	86	88	Chemical/Drug"	"METH	106	110	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""DA"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""METH"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Taken together, these findings demonstrate that DA is not essential for the development of METH - induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity and suggest that mechanisms independent of DA warrant more intense investigation.

DISCUSSION: Swallowing - induced atrial tachyarrhythmia ( SIAT) is a rare phenomenon.	[]
Fewer than 50 cases of SIAT have been described in the literature.	[]

Although it is difficult to define causality in a case report, it is logical to think that a beta - agonist like salbutamol ( known to induce tachycardia) may be the trigger of adrenergic reflexes originating in the esophagus while swallowing and that a beta - blocker such as atenolol ( that blocks the adrenergic activity) may relieve it.

Glutamatergic neurotransmission mediated by NMDA receptors in the inferior colliculus can modulate haloperidol - induced catalepsy.

The inferior colliculus ( IC) is primarily involved in the processing of auditory information, but it is distinguished from other auditory nuclei in the brainstem by its connections with structures of the motor system.	[]
Functional evidence relating the IC to motor behavior derives from experiments showing that activation of the IC by electrical stimulation or excitatory amino acid microinjection causes freezing, escape - like behavior, and immobility.

However, the nature of this immobility is still unclear.	[]
The present study examined the influence of excitatory amino acid - mediated mechanisms in the IC on the catalepsy induced by the dopamine receptor blocker haloperidol administered systemically ( 1 or 0. 5 mg / kg) in rats.

Haloperidol - induced catalepsy was challenged with prior intracollicular microinjections of glutamate NMDA receptor antagonists, MK - 801 ( 15 or 30 mmol / 0. 5 microl) and AP7 ( 10 or 20 nmol / 0. 5 microl), or of the NMDA receptor agonist N - methyl - d - aspartate ( NMDA, 20 or 30 nmol / 0. 5 microl).

The results showed that intracollicular microinjection of MK - 801 and AP7 previous to systemic injections of haloperidol significantly attenuated the catalepsy, as indicated by a reduced latency to step down from a horizontal bar.

The serotonin 6 ( 5 - HT6) receptor is therapeutically targeted by several second generation antipsychotics, such as clozapine and olanzapine, and d - amphetamine - induced hyperactivity in rats is corrected with the use of a selective 5 - HT6 receptor antagonist.

In addition, the disrupted prepulse inhibition induced by d - amphetamine or phencyclidine was restored by 5 - HT6 receptor antagonist in an animal study using rats.

BACKGROUND: The prognosis for transplant - free survivors of paracetamol - induced acute liver failure remains unknown.	"paracetamol	61	72	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""paracetamol"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
AIM: To examine whether paracetamol - induced acute liver failure increases long - term mortality.	"paracetamol	24	35	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""paracetamol"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METHODS: We followed up all transplant - free survivors of paracetamol - induced acute liver injury, hospitalized in a Danish national referral centre during 1984 - 2004.	"paracetamol	59	70	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""paracetamol"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
We compared age - specific mortality rates from 1 year post - discharge through 2008 between those in whom the liver injury led to an acute liver failure and those in whom it did not.	[]
RESULTS: We included 641 patients.	[]
On average, age - specific mortality rates were slightly higher for the 101 patients whose paracetamol - induced liver injury had caused an acute liver failure ( adjusted mortality rate ratio = 1. 70, 95% CI 1. 02 - 2. 85), but the association was age - dependent, and no survivors of acute liver failure died of liver disease, whereas suicides were frequent in both groups.	"paracetamol	91	102	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""paracetamol"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
These observations speak against long - term effects of acute liver failure.	[]
More likely, the elevated mortality rate ratio resulted from incomplete adjustment for the greater prevalence of substance abuse among survivors of acute liver failure.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: Paracetamol - induced acute liver failure did not affect long - term mortality.	"Paracetamol	13	24	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Paracetamol"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

AIM: Experimental and clinical studies have revealed that hippocampal DBS can control epileptic activity, but the mechanism of action is obscure and optimal stimulation parameters are not clearly defined.	[]
The aim was to evaluate the effects of high frequency hippocampal stimulation on cortical epileptic activity in penicillin - induced epilepsy model.	"penicillin	112	122	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""penicillin"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty - five Sprague - Dawley rats were implanted DBS electrodes.	[]
In group - 1 ( n = 10) hippocampal DBS was off and in the group - 2 ( n = 10) hippocampal DBS was on ( 185 Hz, 0. 5V, 1V, 2V, and 5V for 60 sec) following penicillin G injection intracortically.

In the control group hippocampal DBS was on following 8 l saline injection intracortically.	[]
EEG recordings were obtained before and 15 minutes following penicillin - G injection, and at 10th minutes following each stimulus for analysis in terms of frequency, amplitude, and power spectrum.	"penicillin - G	61	75	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""penicillin - G"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
RESULTS: High frequency hippocampal DBS suppressed the acute penicillin - induced cortical epileptic activity independent from stimulus intensity.	"penicillin	61	71	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""penicillin"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In the control group, hippocampal stimulation alone lead only to diffuse slowing of cerebral bioelectrical activity at 5V stimulation.	[]
CONCLUSION: Our results revealed that continuous high frequency stimulation of the hippocampus suppressed acute cortical epileptic activity effectively without causing secondary epileptic discharges.	[]
These results are important in terms of defining the optimal parameters of hippocampal DBS in patients with epilepsy.	[]

Midline B3 serotonin nerves in rat medulla are involved in hypotensive effect of methyldopa.

Previous experiments in this laboratory have shown that microinjection of methyldopa onto the ventrolateral cells of the B3 serotonin neurons in the medulla elicits a hypotensive response mediated by a projection descending into the spinal cord.	"methyldopa	74	84	Chemical/Drug"	"serotonin	124	133	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""methyldopa"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""serotonin"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The present experiments were designed to investigate the role of the midline cells of the B3 serotonin neurons in the medulla, coinciding with the raphe magnus.	"serotonin	93	102	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""serotonin"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In spontaneously hypertensive, stroke - prone rats, microinjection of methyldopa into the area of the midline B3 serotonin cell group in the ventral medulla caused a potent hypotension of 30 - 40 mm Hg, which was maximal 2 - 3 h after administration and was abolished by the serotonin neurotoxin 5, 7 - dihydroxytryptamine ( 5, 7 - DHT) injected intracerebroventricularly.	"methyldopa	70	80	Chemical/Drug"	"serotonin	113	122	Chemical/Drug"	"serotonin	113	122	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""methyldopa"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""serotonin"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""serotonin"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
However, intraspinal injection of 5, 7 - DHT to produce a more selective lesion of only descending serotonin projections in the spinal cord did not affect this hypotension.	"serotonin	99	108	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""serotonin"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Further, 5, 7 - DHT lesion of serotonin nerves travelling in the median forebrain bundle, one of the main ascending pathways from the B3 serotonin cells, did not affect the fall in blood pressure associated with a midline B3 serotonin methyldopa injection.	"serotonin	30	39	Chemical/Drug"	"serotonin	30	39	Chemical/Drug"	"serotonin	30	39	Chemical/Drug"	"methyldopa	235	245	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""serotonin"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""serotonin"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""serotonin"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""methyldopa"", ""start_span"": 235, ""end_span"": 245, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
It is concluded therefore that, unlike the ventrolateral B3 cells which mediate a methyldopa - induced hypotension via descending projections, the midline serotonin B3 cells in the medulla contribute to the hypotensive action of methyldopa, either by way of an ascending projection which does not pass through the median forebrain bundle, or through a projection restricted to the caudal brainstem.

Three days post lesion, most rats circled predominantly contralaterally to the lesion.	[]
Such contralateral rotation may result from either degeneration - induced breakdown of the DA pool, or lesion - induced increase of DA turnover in the spared neurons.	[]

However, regardless of the duration of recovery ( and irrespective of either lesion volume, amphetamine dose, or post - lesion motor exercise), amphetamine - induced rotation tended to become gradually more ipsilateral as the observation session progressed, and all rats circled ipsilaterally to the lesion in response to further amphetamine injections.

The role of cyclosporine ( CSA) alone or in combination with various chemotherapeutics in the development of renal toxicity was evaluated in rats.

The combined administration of CSA and various chemotherapeutic drugs with a nephrotoxic potential, such as gentamicin ( at therapeutic doses), amphothericin B and ketoconazole, which are frequently used in immunosuppressed patients, did not aggravate the CSA induced toxicity in the rat model.

If this were so, patients with coronary artery disease might be especially susceptible.	[]
Thus, myocardial electrical excitability was measured in patients with mild essential hypertension and known coronary artery disease after 8 weeks of treatment with a potassium - conserving diuretic ( amiloride) and a similar period on a potassium - losing diuretic ( chlorthalidone) in a randomised study.

Plasma potassium concentrations were on average 1 mmol / L lower during the chlorthalidone phase compared to amiloride therapy.

Blood pressure and volume states as assessed by bodyweight, plasma renin and noradrenaline ( norepinephrine) concentrations were similar on the 2 regimens.

Compared to amiloride treatment, the chlorthalidone phase was associated with an increased frequency of ventricular ectopic beats ( 24 - hour Holter monitoring) and a higher Lown grading, increased upslope and duration of the monophasic action potential, prolonged ventricular effective refractory period, and increased electrical instability during programmed ventricular stimulation.

The above results indicate that because potassium - losing diuretic therapy can increase myocardial electrical excitability in patients with ischaemic heart disease, even minor falls in plasma potassium concentrations are probably best avoided in such patients.

Plasma apolipoprotein A - I tended to increase ( 40% increase at day 5).	[]
At the beginning of nephrotic stage ( day 6) the concentration of plasma albumin dropped to a very low level, while that of apolipoprotein A - I increased abruptly ( 4 - fold increase) and continued to rise, although less steeply, in the following days.	[]
The plasma concentration of HDL followed the same pattern.	[]
Plasma VLDL and LDL increased at a later stage ( day 9).	[]
Plasma apolipoprotein A - I was found not only in HDL ( 1. 063 - 1. 210 g / ml) but also in the LDL density class ( 1. 025 - 1. 050 g / ml).	[]
In the pre - nephrotic stage lipoproteinuria was negligible, while in the early nephrotic stage the urinary loss of plasma lipoproteins consisted mainly of HDL.	[]
These observations indicate that puromycin aminonucleoside alters plasma lipoproteins by lowering VLDL and increasing HDL.	"puromycin aminonucleoside	33	58	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""puromycin aminonucleoside"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

Prostaglandin E2 - induced bladder hyperactivity in normal, conscious rats: involvement of tachykinins?

In normal conscious rats investigated by continuous cystometry, intravesically instilled prostaglandin ( PG) E2 facilitated micturition and increased basal intravesical pressure.	[]
The effect was attenuated by both the NK1 receptor selective antagonist RP 67, 580 and the NK2 receptor selective antagonist SR 48, 968, given intra - arterially, suggesting that it was mediated by stimulation of both NK1 and NK2 receptors.	[]
Intra - arterially given PGE2 produced a distinct increase in bladder pressure before initiating a micturition reflex, indicating that the PG had a direct contractant effect on the detrusor smooth muscle.

The effect of intra - arterial PGE2 could not be blocked by intra - arterial RP 67, 580 or SR 48, 968, which opens the possibility that the micturition reflex elicited by intra - arterial PGE2 was mediated by pathways other than the reflex initiated when the PG was given intravesically.

The present results thus suggest that intra - arterial PGE2, given near the bladder, may initiate micturition in the normal rat chiefly by directly contracting the smooth muscle of the detrusor.

Initial studies ( Bornstein 1968) showed that it possessed no respiratory suppressant effects and no addiction liability.	[]
Subsequently, however, several articles reporting abuse of this drug have appeared in the literature.	[]
The drug is known to cause a variety of acute toxic effects, ranging from nausea, restlessness, insomnia, ataxia, slurred speech and nystagmus to mood changes, perceptual alterations, inattention, disorientation and aggressive behavior ( Rammer et al 1988; Katona and Watson 1986; Isbell and Fraser 1953; Devlin et al 1985; McCarthy 1971; Dodds and Revai 1967; Degkwitz 1964; Hildebrand et al 1989).

No significant change in these parameters occurred in the control patients.	[]
No significant change in myocardial oxygen consumption occurred after ouabain administration but this may be related to a greater decrease in mean arterial pressure in the ouabain patients than in the control patients.

PURPOSE: Glucocorticoid administration can lead to the development of ocular hypertension and corticosteroid glaucoma in a subset of the population through a decrease in the aqueous humor outflow facility.	[]
The purpose of this study was to determine whether glucocorticoid treatment can directly affect the outflow facility of isolated, perfusion - cultured human eyes.	[]
METHODS: The anterior segments of human donor eyes from regional eye banks were placed in a constant flow, variable pressure perfusion culture system.	[]
Paired eyes were perfused in serum - free media with or without 10 ( - 7) M dexamethasone for 12 days.	"dexamethasone	76	89	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dexamethasone"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Intraocular pressure was monitored daily.	[]
After incubation, the eyes were morphologically characterized by light microscopy, transmission and scanning electron microscopy, and scanning laser confocal microscopy.	[]
RESULTS: A significant increase in intraocular pressure developed in 13 of the 44 pairs of eyes perfused with dexamethasone with an average pressure rise of 17. 5 + / - 3. 8 mm Hg after 12 days of dexamethasone exposure.	"dexamethasone	110	123	Chemical/Drug"	"dexamethasone	110	123	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dexamethasone"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""dexamethasone"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The contralateral control eyes, which did not receive dexamethasone, maintained a stable intraocular pressure during the same period.	"dexamethasone	54	67	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""dexamethasone"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The outflow pathway of the untreated eyes appeared morphologically normal.	[]
In contrast, the dexamethasone - treated hypertensive eyes had thickened trabecular beams, decreased intertrabecular spaces, thickened juxtacanalicular tissue, activated trabecular meshwork cells, and increased amounts of amorphogranular extracellular material, especially in the juxtacanalicular tissue and beneath the endothelial lining of the canal of Schlemm.

RESULTS: Hallucinations occurred only when the patient ' s eyes were closed and, in all but one case, were reported as disturbing or frightening.	[]
Underreporting of these hallucinations by patients is likely.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: Hallucinations may be the sole or first manifestation of neurotoxicity.	[]
The incidence may be dose and infusion - time related.	[]
The clinician should be alerted for possible ifosfamide - induced hallucinations, which may occur without other signs of neurotoxicity.	"ifosfamide	45	55	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ifosfamide"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"

The loss of GAD mRNA - containing neurons in the hilus contrasted with the relative preservation of labeled putative basket cells along the inner margin of the granule cell layer.	[]
Quantitative analyses of labeled neurons in three regions of the dentate gyrus in the 1 and 2 week groups showed statistically significant decreases in the mean number of GAD mRNA - containing neurons in the hilus of both groups of experimental animals.	[]
No significant differences were found in the molecular layer or the granule cell layer, which included labeled neurons along the lower margin of the granule cell layer.	[]
The results indicate that, in this model, a subpopulation of GAD mRNA - containing neurons within the dentate gyrus is selectively vulnerable to seizure - induced damage.	[]

Although short term remission of severe RA following BMT has been reported, these are the first cases for which prolonged followup has been available.	[]
This experience raises the question of the role of BMT itself as a therapeutic option for patients with uncontrolled destructive synovitis.	[]

Right carotid angiograms failed to show the SSS and inferior sagittal sinus, suggestive of venous sinus thrombosis.	[]
Coexistence of the cerebral artery and the venous sinus occlusion has been described infrequently.	[]
In this case, the authors postulate that the use of estradiol and progesterone and the underlying DM increased vascular thrombogenicity, which provided a common denominator for thrombosis of both the ICA and the venous sinus.

Leukopenia was dose limiting: as many as 62. 5% of patients experienced grade 4 leukopenia.	[]
We investigated the efficacy and toxicity of a 3 - hour paclitaxel infusion in a phase II trial in patients with inoperable stage IIIB or IV NSCLC.	"paclitaxel	56	66	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""paclitaxel"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The 58 patients treated ( 41 men and 17 women) had a median age of 59 years ( age range, 25 to 75) and a performance status of 0 through 2.	[]
Most patients ( 72. 4%) had stage IV NSCLC.	[]
Paclitaxel 225 mg / m2 was infused over 3 hours every 3 weeks with standard prophylactic premedication.	"Paclitaxel	0	10	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Paclitaxel"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Of 50 patients evaluable for response, 12 ( 24%) had partial remission, 26 ( 52%) had no change, and 12 had disease progression ( 24%).	[]
Hematologic toxicities were mild: only one patient ( 2%) developed grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, while 29% had grade 1 or 2.	[]
Grade 1 or 2 polyneuropathy affected 56% of patients while only one ( 2%) experienced severe polyneuropathy.	[]
Similarly, grade 1 or 2 myalgia / arthralgia was observed in 63. 2% of patients, but only 14. 3% experienced grade 3 or 4.	[]
Nausea and vomiting were infrequent, with 14% of patients experiencing grade 1 or 2 and only 2% experiencing grade 3 or 4.	[]
Paclitaxel is thus an active single agent in this patient population, with a 3 - hour infusion proving comparably effective to a 24 - hour infusion and superior in terms of the incidence of hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity.

In a phase I study to determine the maximum tolerated dose of paclitaxel ( Taxol; Bristol - Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) given as a 3 - hour infusion in combination with carboplatin administered every 21 days to women with advanced ovarian cancer, paclitaxel doses were escalated as follows: level 1, 135 mg / m2; level 2, 160 mg / m2; level 3, 185 mg / m2; and level 4, 210 mg / m2.	"paclitaxel	62	72	Chemical/Drug"	"Taxol	75	80	Chemical/Drug"	"carboplatin	178	189	Chemical/Drug"	"paclitaxel	62	72	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""paclitaxel"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""Taxol"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""carboplatin"", ""start_span"": 178, ""end_span"": 189, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""paclitaxel"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The fixed dose of carboplatin at levels 1 through 4 was given to achieve an area under the concentration - time curve ( AUC) of 5 using the Calvert formula.	"carboplatin	18	29	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""carboplatin"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
In levels 5 and 6 the carboplatin dose was targeted at AUCs of 6 and 7. 5, respectively, combined with a fixed paclitaxel dose of 185 mg / m2.

To date, 30 previously untreated patients, all with a good performance status ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0 to 2) have been entered into this ongoing study.	[]
The dose - limiting toxicity of the combination was myelosuppression ( leukopenia, granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia).	[]
Neurotoxicity was largely moderate.	[]
So far, 14 patients are evaluable for response; of these, eight ( 57%) showed objective ( complete or partial) response and disease stabilized in six patients.	[]
No patient had disease progression.	[]
We conclude that the combination of paclitaxel 185 mg / m2 administered as a 3 - hour infusion followed immediately by a 1 - hour infusion of carboplatin at an AUC of 6 can be administered safely in a 21 - day schedule in the outpatient setting.

Steroid treatment also induced a leftward shift of the force - frequency curve at 25 and 50 Hz when compared with saline treatment ( p < 0. 05).	"Steroid	0	7	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Steroid"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
ATPase staining of the diaphragm, scalenus medius, and gastrocnemius showed type IIb fiber atrophy in the steroid groups and also diaphragmatic type IIa atrophy with T, whereas histologic examinations revealed a normal muscular pattern with absence of necrosis.

In addition, subcutaneous delivery of the neutralizing agent will not be associated with the risk of inadequate urinary mesna concentrations, such as in a patient taking oral mesna who experiences severe ifosfamide - induced emesis and is unable to absorb the drug.

Ethinyl estradiol - treated animals excreted significantly less 14C as taurocholic acid than did control animals, consistent with an impairment of 7alpha - hydroxylation of taurodeoxycholic acid.

However, the initial clinical development of lometrexol was curtailed because of severe and cumulative antiproliferative toxicities.	"lometrexol	45	55	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""lometrexol"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Preclinical murine studies demonstrated that the toxicity of lometrexol can be prevented by low dose folic acid administration, i. e. for 7 days prior to and 7 days following a single bolus dose.

Compared with controls, EDDs were more frequently black, male, and younger.	[]
They were less likely to have a low body mass index, and more likely to have died in police custody, to have received medical treatment immediately before death, to have survived for a longer period, to have developed hyperthermia, and to have died in summer months.	[]
EDDs had concentrations of cocaine and benzoylecgonine in autopsy blood that were similar to those for controls.

The epidemiologic findings are most consistent with the hypothesis that chronic cocaine use disrupts dopaminergic function and, when coupled with recent cocaine use, may precipitate agitation, delirium, aberrant thermoregulation, rhabdomyolysis, and sudden death.

The choreoathetoid movements began 45 min to 1 h after ingestion.	[]
The children gave no history of prior movement disorders and there was no family history of movement disorders.	[]
The children received gastrointestinal decontamination and high doses of intravenous benzodiazepines in an attempt to control the choreoathetoid movements.

Effect of myopic excimer laser photorefractive keratectomy on the electrophysiologic function of the retina and optic nerve.	[]
PURPOSE: To assess by electrophysiologic testing the effect of photorefractive keratectomy ( PRK) on the retina and optic nerve.	[]
SETTING: Eye Clinic, S.	[]
Salvatore Hospital, L ' Aquila University, Italy.	[]
METHODS: Standard pattern electroretinograms ( P - ERGs) and standard pattern visual evoked potentials ( P - VEPs) were done in 25 eyes of 25 patients who had myopic PRK for an attempted correction between 5. 00 and 15. 00 diopters ( D) ( mean 8. 00 D).	[]
Testing was done preoperatively and 3, 6, 12, and 18 months postoperatively.	[]
The contralateral eyes served as controls.	[]
During the follow - up, 3 patients ( 12%) developed steroid - induced elevated intraocular pressure ( IOP) that resolved after corticosteroid therapy was discontinued.

Neutrophils from 14 ALF patients were stimulated via the complement receptors using zymosan opsonized with ALF or control serum.	[]
Superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production by ALF neutrophils stimulated with zymosan opsonized with ALF serum was significantly reduced compared with the control subjects ( P < 0. 01).

A 24 - h pretreatment of both rats and mice with a single dose of CS ( 100mg / kg, i. p.), resulted in significant protection against the hepatotoxic effects of CCl4, CHCl3, acetaminophen and galactosamine and against the lethal ( and presumably cardiotoxic) effect of adriamycin administration.

Steroids with the 3 - hydroxy group in the alpha - position and 5 - H in the alpha - or beta - configurations were highly effective in protecting against pilocarpine ( 416 mg / kg, s. c.) - induced limbic motor seizures and status epilepticus ( ED50 values, 7. 0 - 18. 7 mg / kg, i. p.).

The corresponding epimers with the 3 - hydroxy group in the beta - position were also effective but less potent ( ED50 values, 33. 8 - 63. 5, i. p.).	[]
Although the neuroactive steroids were considerably less potent than the benzodiazepine clonazepam in protecting against pilocarpine seizures, steroids with the 5 alpha, 3 alpha - configuration had comparable or higher protective index values ( TD50 for motor impairment divided by ED50 for seizure protection) than clonazepam, indicating that some neuroactive steroids may have lower relative toxicity.

Steroids with the 5 alpha, 3 alpha - or 5 beta, 3 alpha - configurations also produced a dose - dependent delay in the onset of limbic seizures induced by kainic acid ( 32 mg / kg, s. c.), but did not completely protect against the seizures.

However, when a second dose of the steroid was administered 1 hr after the first dose, complete protection from the kainic acid - induced limbic seizures and status epilepticus was obtained.	"steroid	35	42	Chemical/Drug"	"kainic acid	116	127	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""steroid"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""kainic acid"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The steroids also caused a dose - dependent delay in NMDA ( 257 mg / kg, s. c.) - induced lethality, but did not completely protect against NMDA seizures or lethality.

Neuroleptic - induced catalepsy, a model of neuroleptic - induced extrapyramidal side effects, was considered suitable as a model for predicting neuroleptic - induced akathisia in humans, although neuroleptic - induced catalepsy was not considered a specific test for neuroleptic - induced akathisia.	[]
Therefore, the effects of carteolol, a beta - adrenoceptor antagonist, on haloperidol - induced catalepsy in rats were behaviorally studied and compared with those of propranolol and biperiden, a muscarinic receptor antagonist.

Carteolol did not antagonize the inhibitory effects of haloperidol on apomorphine - induced stereotypy and locomotor activity in rats.

In addition, carteolol did not evoke 5 - HT1A receptor - stimulating behavioral signs such as flat body posture and forepaw treading and did not inhibit 5 - hydroxytryptophan - induced head twitch in rats.

These results strongly suggest that carteolol improves haloperidol - induced catalepsy via its beta - adrenoceptor antagonistic activity and is expected to be effective in the treatment of akathisia without attenuating neuroleptic - induced antipsychotic effects due to its postsynaptic dopamine receptor antagonistic activity.

To elucidate the role of estrogen in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis in the pituitary of female rats, the density of blood vessels was analysed using factor VIII related antigen ( FVIIIRAg) immunohistochemistry and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor / vascular permeability factor ( VEGF / VPF) was examined by Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis.

Posteroventral medial pallidotomy in advanced Parkinson ' s disease.	[]
BACKGROUND: Posteroventral medial pallidotomy sometimes produces striking improvement in patients with advanced Parkinson ' s disease, but the studies to date have involved small numbers of patients and short - term follow - up.	[]
"METHODS: Forty patients with Parkinson ' s disease underwent serial, detailed assessments both after drug withdrawal ( "" off "" period) and while taking their optimal medical regimens ( "" on "" period)."	[]
All patients were examined preoperatively and 39 were examined at six months; 27 of the patients were also examined at one year, and 11 at two years.	[]
RESULTS: The percent improvements at six months were as follows: off - period score for overall motor function, 28 percent ( 95 percent confidence interval, 19 to 38 percent), with most of the improvement in the contralateral limbs; off - period score for activities of daily living, 29 percent ( 95 percent confidence interval, 19 to 39 percent); on - period score for contralateral dyskinesias, 82 percent ( 95 percent confidence interval, 72 to 91 percent); and on - period score for ipsilateral dyskinesias, 44 percent ( 95 percent confidence interval, 29 to 59 percent).	[]
The improvements in dyskinesias and the total scores for off - period parkinsonism, contralateral bradykinesia, and rigidity were sustained in the 11 patients examined at two years.	[]
The improvement in ipsilateral dyskinesias was lost after one year, and the improvements in postural stability and gait lasted only three to six months.	[]
Approximately half the patients who had been dependent on assistance in activities of daily living in the off period before surgery became independent after surgery.	[]
The complications of surgery were generally well tolerated, and there were no significant changes in the use of medication.	[]
CONCLUSIONS: In late - stage Parkinson ' s disease, pallidotomy significantly reduces levodopa - induced dyskinesias and off - period disability.	"levodopa	86	94	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""levodopa"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Much of the benefit is sustained at two years, although some improvements, such as those on the ipsilateral side and in axial symptoms, wane within the first year.	[]
The on - period symptoms that are resistant to dopaminergic therapy do not respond to pallidotomy.	[]

Light microscopy of renal biopsy samples showed minimal glomerular capillary wall thickening and mesangial matrix increase, or no departure from normal.	[]
Electron microscopy, however, revealed subepithelial electron - dense deposits, fusion of epithelial cell foot processes, and evidence of mesangial cell hyperactivity.	[]
Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated granular capillary wall deposits of IgG and C3.	[]
The findings were similar to those in early membranous glomerulonephritis, differences being observed however in the results of staining for the early - acting complement components C1q and C4.	[]
It is tentatively concluded that complement was activated by the classical pathway.	[]

Using a positron emission tomography ( PET) study it was shown recently that in migraine without aura certain areas in the brain stem were activated during the headache state, but not in the headache free interval.	[]
It was suggested that this brain stem activation is inherent to the migraine attack itself and represents the so called ' migraine generator '.	[]
To test this hypothesis we performed an experimental pain study in seven healthy volunteers, using the same positioning in the PET scanner as in the migraine patients.	[]
A small amount of capsaicin was administered subcutaneously in the right forehead to evoke a burning painful sensation in the first division of the trigeminal nerve.	"capsaicin	18	27	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""capsaicin"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Increases of regional cerebral blood flow ( rCBF) were found bilaterally in the insula, in the anterior cingulate cortex, the cavernous sinus and the cerebellum.	[]
Using the same stereotactic space limits as in the above mentioned migraine study no brain stem activation was found in the acute pain state compared to the pain free state.	[]
The increase of activation in the region of the cavernous sinus however, suggests that this structure is more likely to be involved in trigeminal transmitted pain as such, rather than in a specific type of headache as was suggested for cluster headache.	[]

Sixty - five patients, 34 women and 31 men, ages 36 to 80 years, received either normal saline before and after TDI ( group 1), 125 mg i. v. MP before and saline after TDI ( group 2), or 125 mg i. v.

Patients were observed for 72 hours and reactions were recorded and graded according to severity.	[]
Fifty - eight percent of group 1 patients, 33% of group 2, and 26% of group 3 had reactions to TDI.	[]
The severity of reactions ( minimal, mild, and moderate, respectively) was as follows: group 1 - - 6, 6, and 2; group 2 - - 1, 5, and 0; group 3 - - 5, 1, and 0.	[]
Data were analyzed by the two - sided Fisher ' s exact test using 95% confidence intervals with the approximation of Woolf.	[]

Single photon emission tomography with i. v. 133Xe was used to measure the rCBF changes.	[]
The dyskinetic parkinsonian patients exhibited a pattern of response which was markedly different from those of the normal subjects and non - dyskinetic parkinsonian patients, with a significant overactivation in the supplementary motor area and the ipsi - and contralateral primary motor areas.	[]
These results are compatible with the hypothesis that an hyperkinetic abnormal involuntary movement, like L - dopa - induced peak dose dyskinesia, is due to a disinhibition of the primary and associated motor cortex secondary to an excessive outflow of the pallidothalamocortical motor loop.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 329 patients enrolled in the study at 24 centers.	[]
All patients had a pre - therapy Gram ' s stain and culture of sinus exudate obtained by antral puncture or nasal endoscopy.	[]
Clinical response was assessed on the basis of signs and symptoms and sinus radiograph or computed tomography results.	[]
Microbiologic cure rates were determined on the basis of presumed plus documented eradication of the pre - therapy pathogen ( s).	[]
RESULTS: The most common pathogens were Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Moraxella catarrhalis.	[]
Of 300 clinically evaluable patients, 175 ( 58%) were cured and 90 ( 30%) were improved at the post - therapy evaluation, resulting in a clinical success rate of 88%.	[]
Thirty - five patients ( 12%) clinically failed treatment.	[]
The microbiologic eradication rate ( presumed plus documented) among 138 microbiologically evaluable patients was 92%.	[]
Microbiologic eradication rates ( presumed plus documented) of the most common pathogens ranged from 93% ( M. catarrhalis) to 100% ( S. pneumoniae) at the post - therapy visit.	[]
All but one of the 265 patients who were cured or improved at post - therapy returned for a long - term follow - up visit; 243 ( 92%) remained well 4 to 6 weeks after therapy; and 21 ( 8%) had a relapse of symptoms.	[]

BACKGROUND: The most striking of carboplatin ' s advantages ( CBDCA) over cisplatin ( CDDP) is its markedly reduced rate of neurotoxic effects.

However, the use of CBDCA higher - intensity schedules and the association with other neurotoxic drugs in polychemotherapy may cause some concern about its safety with respect to peripheral nervous system damage.	"CBDCA	20	25	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""CBDCA"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two different schedules of CBDCA administration ( 10 mg / kg and 15 mg / kg i. p. twice a week for nine times) were evaluated in Wistar rats.	"CBDCA	50	55	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""CBDCA"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Neurotoxicity was assessed for behavioral ( tail - flick test), neurophysiological ( nerve conduction velocity in the tail nerve), morphological, morphometrical and analytical effects.	[]
RESULTS: CBDCA administration induced dose - dependent peripheral neurotoxicity.	"CBDCA	9	14	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""CBDCA"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Pain perception and nerve conduction velocity in the tail were significantly impaired, particularly after the high - dose treatment.	[]
The dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons and, to a lesser extent, satellite cells showed the same changes as those induced by CDDP, mainly affecting the nucleus and nucleolus of ganglionic sensory neurons.	"CDDP	125	129	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""CDDP"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Moreover, significant amounts of platinum were detected in the dorsal root ganglia and kidney after CBDCA treatment.

CONCLUSIONS: CBDCA is neurotoxic in our model, and the type of pathological changes it induces are so closely similar to those caused by CDDP that it is probable that neurotoxicity is induced in the two drugs by the same mechanism.

BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome is a common cause of abdominal pain and discomfort and may be related to disordered gastrointestinal motility.	[]
Our aim was to assess the effects of long - term treatment with a prokinetic agent, cisapride, on postprandial jejunal motility and symptoms in the irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS).	"cisapride	84	93	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""cisapride"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METHODS: Thirty - eight patients with IBS ( constipation - predominant, n = 17; diarrhoea - predominant, n = 21) underwent 24 - h ambulatory jejunal manometry before and after 12 week ' s treatment [ cisapride, 5 mg three times daily ( n = 19) or placebo ( n = 19)].

Italian Tamoxifen Prevention Study.	"Tamoxifen	8	17	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Tamoxifen"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
BACKGROUND: Tamoxifen is a candidate chemopreventive agent in breast cancer, although the drug may be associated with the development of endometrial cancer.	"Tamoxifen	12	21	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""Tamoxifen"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Therefore we did a trial in hysterectomised women of tamoxifen as a chemopreventive.	"tamoxifen	53	62	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""tamoxifen"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
METHODS: In October, 1992, we started a double - blind placebo - controlled, randomised trial of tamoxifen in women ( mainly in Italy) who did not have breast cancer and who had had a hysterectomy.	"tamoxifen	97	106	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""tamoxifen"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Women were randomised to receive tamoxifen 20 mg per day or placebo, both orally for 5 years.	"tamoxifen	33	42	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""tamoxifen"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The original plan was to follow the intervention phase by 5 years ' follow - up.	[]
In June, 1997, the trialists and the data - monitoring committee decided to end recruitment primarily because of the number of women dropping out of the study.	[]
Recruitment ended on July 11, 1997, and the study will continue as planned.	[]
The primary endpoints are the occurrence of and deaths from breast cancer.	[]
This preliminary interim analysis is based on intention - to - treat.	[]
FINDINGS: 5408 women were randomised; participating women have a median follow - up of 46 months for major endpoints.	[]
41 cases of breast cancer occurred so far; there have been no deaths from breast cancer.	[]
There is no difference in breast - cancer frequency between the placebo ( 22 cases) and tamoxifen ( 19) arms.	"tamoxifen	88	97	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""tamoxifen"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
There is a statistically significant reduction of breast cancer among women receiving tamoxifen who also used hormone - replacement therapy during the trial: among 390 women on such therapy and allocated to placebo, we found eight cases of breast cancer compared with one case among 362 women allocated to tamoxifen.	"tamoxifen	86	95	Chemical/Drug"	"tamoxifen	86	95	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""tamoxifen"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""tamoxifen"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Compared with the placebo group, there was a significantly increased risk of vascular events and hypertriglyceridaemia among women on tamoxifen.	"tamoxifen	134	143	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""tamoxifen"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
INTERPRETATION: Although this preliminary analysis has low power, in this cohort of women at low - to - normal risk of breast cancer, the postulated protective effects of tamoxifen are not yet apparent.	"tamoxifen	171	180	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""tamoxifen"", ""start_span"": 171, ""end_span"": 180, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Women using hormone - replacement therapy appear to have benefited from use of tamoxifen.	"tamoxifen	79	88	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""tamoxifen"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
There were no deaths from breast cancer recorded in women in the study.	[]

OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of folic acid - containing multivitamin supplementation in epileptic women before and during pregnancy in order to determine the rate of structural birth defects and epilepsy - related side effects.	"folic acid	34	44	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""folic acid"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
STUDY DESIGN: First a randomised trial, later periconception care including in total 12225 females.	[]
RESULTS: Of 60 epileptic women with periconceptional folic acid ( 0. 8 mg) - containing multivitamin supplementation, no one developed epilepsy - related side effects during the periconception period.

This case - control study was conducted in the defined population comprising members of Kaiser Permanente of Northern and Southern California.	[]
We attempted to identify all incident strokes in women ages 15 - 44 years during a 3 - year period using hospital admission and discharge records, emergency department logs, and payment requests for out - of - plan hospitalizations.	[]
We selected controls, matched on age and facility of usual care, at random from healthy members of the health plan.	[]
We obtained information in face - to - face interviews.	[]
There were 347 confirmed stroke cases and 1, 021 controls.	[]
The univariate matched odds ratio for stroke in women who admitted to using cocaine and / or amphetamine was 8. 5 ( 95% confidence interval = 3. 6 - 20. 0).

The stage of olig - anuria lasted for 1 - 3 weeks, and five of the patients were treated by hemodialysis.	[]
Two of the patients died due to unrelated causes during the follow - up period.	[]
The four patients re - examined were clinically cured.	[]
Pathologic findings by light microscopy and immunofluorescence at biopsy were scarce.	[]
Nothing abnormal was seen by electron microscopy in two of the cases studied.	[]
Renal function was normal.	[]
In three cases the excretion at 131I - hippuran renography was slightly slowed.	[]
Although in the acute stage the renal lesions histologically appeared toxic, evidence suggestive of an immunological mechanism cannot be excluded.	[]

Using a single - dose therapy, peak concentration determination is not necessary, only trough samples should be monitored to ensure levels below 2 microg / ml.	[]
Enhanced bradycardia induced by beta - adrenoceptor antagonists in rats pretreated with isoniazid.	"isoniazid	88	97	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""isoniazid"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
High doses of isoniazid increase hypotension induced by vasodilators and change the accompanying reflex tachycardia to bradycardia, an interaction attributed to decreased synthesis of brain gamma - aminobutyric acid ( GABA).

Isoniazid significantly increased bradycardia after propranolol, pindolol, labetalol and atenolol, as well as after clonidine, but not after hexamethonium or carbachol.

Enhancement was not observed in rats pretreated with methylatropine or previously vagotomised.	"methylatropine	53	67	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""methylatropine"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
These results are compatible with interference by isoniazid with GABAergic inhibition of cardiac parasympathetic tone.	"isoniazid	50	59	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""isoniazid"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Such interference could be exerted centrally, possibly at the nucleus ambiguus, or peripherally at the sinus node.	[]
Structural and functional impairment of mitochondria in adriamycin - induced cardiomyopathy in mice: suppression of cytochrome c oxidase II gene expression.	"adriamycin	56	66	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""adriamycin"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
The use of adriamycin ( ADR) in cancer chemotherapy has been limited due to its cumulative cardiovascular toxicity.	"adriamycin	11	21	Chemical/Drug"	"ADR	24	27	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""adriamycin"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""ADR"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Earlier observations that ADR interacts with mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase ( COX) and suppresses its enzyme activity led us to investigate ADR ' s action on the cardiovascular functions and heart mitochondrial morphology in Balb - c mice i. p. treated with ADR for several weeks.	"ADR	26	29	Chemical/Drug"	"ADR	26	29	Chemical/Drug"	"ADR	26	29	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ADR"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""ADR"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""ADR"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
At various times during treatment, the animals were assessed for cardiovascular functions by electrocardiography and for heart tissue damage by electron microscopy.	[]
In parallel, total RNA was extracted from samples of dissected heart and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization to determine the steady - state level of three RNA transcripts encoded by the COXII, COXIII, and COXIV genes.	[]
Similarly, samples obtained from the liver of the same animals were analyzed for comparative studies.	[]
Our results indicated that 1) treatment of mice with ADR caused cardiovascular arrhythmias characterized by bradycardia, extension of ventricular depolarization time ( tQRS), and failure of QRS at high concentrations ( 10 - 14 mg / kg body weight cumulative dose); 2) the heart mitochondria underwent swelling, fusion, dissolution, and / or disruption of mitochondrial cristae after several weeks of treatment.	"ADR	53	56	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ADR"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Such abnormalities were not observed in the mitochondria of liver tissue; and 3) among the three genes of COX enzyme examined, only COXII gene expression was suppressed by ADR treatment, mainly after 8 weeks in both heart and liver.	"ADR	172	175	Chemical/Drug"	"[{""token"": ""ADR"", ""start_span"": 172, ""end_span"": 175, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"
Knowing that heart mitochondria represent almost 40% of heart muscle by weight, we conclude that the deteriorating effects of ADR on cardiovascular function involve mitochondrial structural and functional impairment.
