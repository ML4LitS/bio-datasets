This study was designed to investigate the chronic cardiotoxic potential of SM - 5887 and a possible deteriorating effect of SM - 5887 on low - grade cardiotoxicity pre - induced by doxorubicin in beagle dogs.

High doses of isoniazid increase hypotension induced by vasodilators and change the accompanying reflex tachycardia to bradycardia, an interaction attributed to decreased synthesis of brain gamma - aminobutyric acid ( GABA).	isoniazid,14,23,Chemical/Drug	gamma - aminobutyric acid,190,215,Chemical/Drug	GABA,218,222,Chemical/Drug	"[{""token"": ""isoniazid"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""gamma - aminobutyric acid"", ""start_span"": 190, ""end_span"": 215, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""GABA"", ""start_span"": 218, ""end_span"": 222, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"	train
In the present study, the possible enhancement by isoniazid of bradycardia induced by beta - adrenoceptor antagonists was determined in rats anaesthetised with chloralose - urethane.	isoniazid,50,59,Chemical/Drug	chloralose,160,170,Chemical/Drug	urethane,173,181,Chemical/Drug	"[{""token"": ""isoniazid"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""chloralose"", ""start_span"": 160, ""end_span"": 170, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""urethane"", ""start_span"": 173, ""end_span"": 181, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"	train
Earlier observations that ADR interacts with mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase ( COX) and suppresses its enzyme activity led us to investigate ADR ' s action on the cardiovascular functions and heart mitochondrial morphology in Balb - c mice i. p. treated with ADR for several weeks.
