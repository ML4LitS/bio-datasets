The effect of aniracetam ( Ro 13 - 5057, 1 - anisoyl - 2 - pyrrolidinone) was studied on various forms of experimentally impaired cognitive functions ( learning and memory) in rodents and produced the following effects: ( 1) almost complete prevention of the incapacity to learn a discrete escape response in rats exposed to sublethal hypercapnia immediately before the acquisition session; ( 2) partial ( rats) or complete ( mice) prevention of the scopolamine - induced short - term amnesia for a passive avoidance task; ( 3) complete protection against amnesia for a passive avoidance task in rats submitted to electroconvulsive shock immediately after avoidance acquisition; ( 4) prevention of the long - term retention - or retrieval - deficit for a passive avoidance task induced in rats and mice by chloramphenicol or cycloheximide administered immediately after acquisition; ( 5) reversal, when administered as late as 1 h before the retention test, of the deficit in retention or retrieval of a passive avoidance task induced by cycloheximide injected 2 days previously; ( 6) prevention of the deficit in the retrieval of an active avoidance task induced in mice by subconvulsant electroshock or hypercapnia applied immediately before retrieval testing ( 24 h after acquisition).	aniracetam,14,24,Chemical/Drug	Ro 13 - 5057,27,39,Chemical/Drug	1 - anisoyl - 2 - pyrrolidinone,41,72,Chemical/Drug	scopolamine,450,461,Chemical/Drug	chloramphenicol,806,821,Chemical/Drug	cycloheximide,825,838,Chemical/Drug	cycloheximide,1038,1051,Chemical/Drug	"[{""token"": ""aniracetam"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""Ro 13 - 5057"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""1 - anisoyl - 2 - pyrrolidinone"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""scopolamine"", ""start_span"": 450, ""end_span"": 461, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""chloramphenicol"", ""start_span"": 806, ""end_span"": 821, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""cycloheximide"", ""start_span"": 825, ""end_span"": 838, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""cycloheximide"", ""start_span"": 1038, ""end_span"": 1051, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"	train
In patients premedicated with scopolamine + morphine ( + 5 mg nitrazepam the evening before surgery), the sleep - inducing effect of midazolam 0. 15 mg / kg i. v. was clearly slower in onset than that of thiopentone 4. 67 mg / kg i. v.

Although the neuroactive steroids were considerably less potent than the benzodiazepine clonazepam in protecting against pilocarpine seizures, steroids with the 5 alpha, 3 alpha - configuration had comparable or higher protective index values ( TD50 for motor impairment divided by ED50 for seizure protection) than clonazepam, indicating that some neuroactive steroids may have lower relative toxicity.	steroids,25,33,Chemical/Drug	benzodiazepine,73,87,Chemical/Drug	clonazepam,88,98,Chemical/Drug	pilocarpine,121,132,Chemical/Drug	steroids,143,151,Chemical/Drug	clonazepam,316,326,Chemical/Drug	steroids,361,369,Chemical/Drug	"[{""token"": ""steroids"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""benzodiazepine"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""clonazepam"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""pilocarpine"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""steroids"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""clonazepam"", ""start_span"": 316, ""end_span"": 326, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}, {""token"": ""steroids"", ""start_span"": 361, ""end_span"": 369, ""type"": ""Chemical/Drug""}]"	train
Acute administration of A - 86929 was as efficacious in alleviating MPTP - induced parkinsonism as levodopa and LY - 171555, but was less likely to reproduce the levodopa - induced dyskinesias in these animals than with either LY - 171555 or subsequent challenge of levodopa.
