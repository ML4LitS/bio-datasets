The retention time of the semicontinuous reactor was maintained at 6 days by pumping conversion residue into the reactor, pumping reactor effluent from the reactor once per hour, and maintaining a liquid volume of 150ml in the reactor.

To calculate relative target abundances, total bacterial 16S rRNA gene copy abundance was quantified using the universal bacterial primer set 338F / 518R ( Lane 1991; Muyzer et al. 1993) and an in - house protocol ( Pallares - Vega et al. 2019).

Maximum power point tracking control The MPPT control consisted of an array of parallel - connected potentiometers imposing resistance on the MFC, an amperometer and a voltmeter ( Model 2000 6 - 1 / 2 Digit Multimeter, Keithley Instruments, USA) for current and voltage measurements [ 39].
