Two Plexiglas double - chamber MECs were operated as batch reactors, with a total volume of 750 ml for each chamber ( 34 by 6 by 3. 5 cm).

Following the inoculation of the reactors, seed sludge was acclimatised to the reactor environment at 30C with 1. 8g volatile solids ( VS) L1day1 organic loading rate ( OLR) and a hydraulic retention time ( HRT) of 20days for 190days.

Furthermore, at this experimental stage, batch systems were utilized to avoid potential heterogeneity of granular sludge resulting from plug - flow hydraulic regimes associated with the operation of sludge bed up - flow reactors ( Wu and Hickey, 1997).

Additional liquid samples ( 4mL) for metagenomic analyses were collected in three replicates and in three time points ( days 41, 52, and 61) at steady - state condition from R1 and R3.

Materials and methods Reactors operation and sampling Anaerobic sludge was obtained from a well - performing anaerobic lab - scale CSTR reactor that had not been exposed to any antibiotics.

Twelve samples collected in the bioreactor from the start - up, steady - state, overloading and recovery periods of the AnMBR process were analyzed.

On day 62 ( time point A) and day 177 ( time point B), all reactors were opened and the carbon substrate from the center of the reactors and the planktonic phase from between the wood chips were sampled.

Establishment of light and heavy oil - degrading produced water cultures Oil - free produced water from all five PW samples was combined in equal ratios and 500 mL aliquots were dispensed into five sterile, custom - made glass vessels.

16S rDNA sequencing of selected samples DNA samples ( from two independent replicates) collected on days 30, 37 and 50 ( phase 2), and days 178, 192 and 206 ( phase 4) from the fermenter and post - digester were selected for high throughput sequencing of the amplified 16S rDNA fragments as described by Sundberg et al. ( 2013).

When the AnMBR faced hydraulic overloading due to the technical failure, one sample ( F10) was collected on day 210 ( 29 April 2016), and after twenty days later on day 230 ( 21 May 2016), a second sample ( J15) was collected to further understand this phenomenon, as a new inoculum ( Seed 2) was used on the day 220 ( 10 May 2016) to prevent the AnMBR process from failing.
