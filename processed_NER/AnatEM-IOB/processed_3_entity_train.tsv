In addition, the punctate staining of AP - 3 by immunofluorescence microscopy, its redistribution to the cytosol by BFA, and the reversibility of the BFA effect ( Dell ' Angelica et al., 1997a; Simpson et al., 1997) also indicate that AP - 3 can cycle between the cytosol and membranes.

The sensitivity of AP - 3 to BFA in cells suggests that its membrane association may be regulated by ARF1, since BFA inhibits ARF1 guanine nucleotide exchange, and has been shown to prevent ARF1 membrane binding in vitro ( Donaldson et al., 1992; Helms and Rothman, 1992; Randazzo et al., 1993).

The increased TNF - alpha production was dependent on cell - to - cell contact because when the two cell types were separated in trans - wells, no stimulation was observed ( Fig. 2 B).

Raising the NK / DC ratio to 5: 1 changes the interaction from one of potent DC stimulation to that of complete inhibition in the presence or absence of LPS ( Fig. 2 C).

The massive production of TNF - alpha in the cultures at the lowest ratios was mediated primarily by DCs in the culture due to the low number of NK cells ( 2 x 104 cells per well) used in these experiments.

In addition, efforts to stimulate NK cells directly with optimal doses of anti - CD16, rIL - 2, rIL - 12, and PMA / ionomycin alone or in combination induced only moderate ( < 500 pg / ml) TNF - alpha production by the NK cells alone which were present at 2 x 105 cells per well ( data not shown).

We next tested directly whether NK cell killing was active in our system using both short - term ( 4 - h) chromium release assays ( data not shown) and a flow cytometric assay which allowed us to follow the survival of the autologous iDCs in the presence of NK cells over longer periods ( Fig. 3).

Compared with the untreated DCs ( Fig. 4 A - C), low NK / DC ratios ( 1: 5 or 1: 1) consistently augmented expression of the maturation markers: CD86 ( Fig. 4 D - I), CD83, and HLA - DR ( data not shown).

Addition of suboptimal doses of LPS ( Fig. 4 C, F, I, and L) augmented the NK - induced maturation at NK / DC ratios of 1: 5 and 1: 1, but had no effect at the 5: 1 ratio.

Again, DC maturation was dependent on NK cell contact and endogenously produced TNF - alpha, because it did not occur when the two cell types were separated in trans - wells or upon the addition of a neutralizing antibody for TNF - alpha ( Fig. 5).

Although the current behavioral results cannot exclude or confirm neural links between reward anticipation and action preparation systems in the brain, they suggest intact cross - talk among subcortical circuits that allow goal - directed action to be modified by motivational factors.

Given the convergence of dopamine and glutamate inputs at the spiny projection neurons in the striatum ( Burns et al., 1994), an interaction between dopamine and glutamate might underlie striatal processes of reward anticipation and action preparation.

Suffice to say that kinetochores are thought to consist of an inner plate hosting an interface between the 15 - subunit constitutive centromere - associated network ( CCAN) and specialized centromeric chromatin; and an outer plate containing the 10 - subunit KMN network ( from the initials of its Knl1, Mis12 and Ndc80 subcomplexes) implicated in microtubule binding.

Since EVT cells possess active invasion - associated genes but are nontumorigenic, our objective was to induce premalignant and then malignant phenotype into a normal EVT cell line in order to identify the molecular basis of tumor progression.

Activation of Ca2 + entry is known to produce endothelial cell shape change, leading to increased permeability, leukocyte migration, and initiation of angiogenesis in conduit - vessel endothelial cells.

SOC activation in rat pulmonary arterial endothelial cells increased free cytosolic Ca2 + that was dependent on a membrane current having a net inward component of 5. 45 + / - 0. 90 pA / pF at - 80 mV.

Changes in endothelial cell shape accompanied SOC activation and were dependent on Ca2 + entry - induced reconfiguration of peripheral ( cortical) filamentous actin ( F - actin).

Because the identity of pulmonary endothelial SOCs is unknown, but mammalian homologues of the Drosophila melanogaster transient receptor potential ( trp) gene have been proposed to form Ca2 + entry channels in nonexcitable cells, we performed RT - PCR using Trp oligonucleotide primers in both rat and human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells.
