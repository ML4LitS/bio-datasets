This restriction enzyme site polymorphism along with the sequence variations were also observed in 50 biopsy tissues as well as in the throat washings of 6 out of 20 healthy individuals that we examined, indicating that the EBV strain predominantly existing in these biopsy tissues was different from strains of B95 - 8, Jijoye or nude mouse passaged cells ( C15) with an African origin, but closely resembled other nude mouse passaged CAO cells which were originally derived from China.
