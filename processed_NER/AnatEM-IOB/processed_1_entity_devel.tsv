The present study was therefore designed to evaluate the expression of thrombospondin 1 and 2 ( TSP - 1, TSP - 2), TSP receptors CD36 and CD47, and matrix - metalloproteases 2 and 9 ( MMP -, MMP - 9) in a rat prostate cancer model.

To address this question, we used the proteomic approach of tandem affinity purification to identify cellular proteins that are in complex with E7, and identified the 600 - kDa protein, p600, as a binding partner of E7.

Thus, c - myc induction is a resistance factor and our findings suggest that tumors carrying low levels of c - Myc protein could be more responsive to vinca alkaloids treatment.	"tumors	77	83	Anatomy"	"[{""token"": ""tumors"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}]"

We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records and the x - rays of 54 consecutive patients with 64 phalangeal fractures treated by open reduction and plate fixation with regard to fracture healing, plate loosening or failure, infection, complex regional pain syndrome, pain, return to work, and range of motion.

To explore the potential of chemotherapy directed at the tyrosine kinase of p185neu, we have found that emodin ( 3 - methyl - 1, 6, 8 - trihydroxyanthraquinone), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, suppresses autophosphorylation and transphosphorylation activities of HER - 2 / neu tyrosine kinase, resulting in tyrosine hypophosphorylation of p185neu in HER - 2 / neu - overexpressing breast cancer cells.	"breast cancer cells	379	398	Anatomy"	"[{""token"": ""breast cancer cells"", ""start_span"": 379, ""end_span"": 398, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}]"
Emodin, at a 40 - microM concentration, which repressed tyrosine kinase of p185neu, efficiently inhibited both anchorage - dependent and anchorage - independent growth of HER - 2 / neu - overexpressing breast cancer cells.
