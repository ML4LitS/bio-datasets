AIF is required for oxidative phosphorylation and for the assembly and / or stabilization of respiratory complex I. 41 Upon induction of apoptosis, AIF is cleaved and released into the cytosol, where it translocates to the nucleus and mediates chromatin condensation and large - scale DNA fragmentation. 41 However, this well - known pro - apoptotic action of AIF is in conflict with the observation that AIF is essential for the maintenance of normal heart function and its inactivation results in dilated C. 42 Moreover, cardiac myocytes isolated from a mouse model with 80% reduction in AIF levels manifested increased cell death induced by oxidative stress, and the hearts of these mice displayed enhanced ischemic damage after in vivo I / R. 43 Although it has been described that AIF is released from cardiac myocyte mitochondria during I / R, its contribution to I / R - induced apoptosis was discounted. 38 However, AIF has been implicated in cardiac myocyte death induced by oxidative stress and HF. 44	cytosol,185,192,Anatomy	nucleus,223,230,Anatomy	chromatin,244,253,Anatomy	heart,452,457,Anatomy	cardiac myocytes,523,539,Anatomy	cell,622,626,Anatomy	hearts,670,676,Anatomy	cardiac myocyte mitochondria,807,835,Anatomy	cardiac myocyte,951,966,Anatomy	"[{""token"": ""cytosol"", ""start_span"": 185, ""end_span"": 192, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""nucleus"", ""start_span"": 223, ""end_span"": 230, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""chromatin"", ""start_span"": 244, ""end_span"": 253, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""heart"", ""start_span"": 452, ""end_span"": 457, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""cardiac myocytes"", ""start_span"": 523, ""end_span"": 539, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 622, ""end_span"": 626, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""hearts"", ""start_span"": 670, ""end_span"": 676, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""cardiac myocyte mitochondria"", ""start_span"": 807, ""end_span"": 835, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""cardiac myocyte"", ""start_span"": 951, ""end_span"": 966, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}]"	train
