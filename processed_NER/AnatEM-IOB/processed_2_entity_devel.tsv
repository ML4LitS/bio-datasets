OBJECTIVE: Although DCC has been considered as a candidate tumor suppressor, the roles it plays in the uterine endometrium and in the carcinogenic process remains unclear.

RESULTS: Endometrial glands in the proliferative and early secretory phase expressed both DCC and netrin - 1, but glands in the late - secretory phase tended to silence DCC expression.

Glut - 2 was expressed in all of the tumors, but the intensity of staining was not consistently stronger than that seen in healthy breast.

Clusters of Glut - 4 - positive granule were observed in cells in six of the tumors.

CONCLUSIONS: Higher expression of the glucose transporter Glut - 1 by breast cancer cells compared with the healthy breast tissue is common.

Somatostatin receptors were detected in peritumoral veins of various human cancer tissue specimens.

In all cases, the somatostatin receptors were localized in veins, particularly in the smooth - muscle cell layer.

Stage 3 is the massive systemic reaction where cytokines turn destructive by compromising the integrity of the capillary walls and flooding end organs.	"capillary walls	111	126	Anatomy"	"organs	144	150	Anatomy"	"[{""token"": ""capillary walls"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""organs"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}]"
While cytokines are generally viewed as a destructive development in the patient that generally leads to multiple organ dysfunction, cytokines also protect the body when localized.

The data provide an example of coordinated changes in the expression of two cell adhesion molecules, syndecan - 1 and E - cadherin during epithelial cell transformation.

It is also expressed by many types of tumour cell and has been associated with metastasis and poor clinical outcome in a number of cancers.

Thus, in 5T4 - transfected CL - S1 murine mammary cells, 5T4 expression is associated with dendritic morphology, accompanied by abrogation of actin / cadherin - containing contacts and increased motility.	"CL - S1 murine mammary cells	27	55	Anatomy"	"dendritic	91	100	Anatomy"	"[{""token"": ""CL - S1 murine mammary cells"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""dendritic"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}]"
The effects of 5T4 expression on morphology and motility are separable since cells transfected with a truncated form of 5T4 cDNA in which the cytoplasmic domain is deleted reveal that the latter is necessary to abrogate actin / cadherin - containing contacts but does not influence the effects on motility.	"cells	77	82	Anatomy"	"cytoplasmic	142	153	Anatomy"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""cytoplasmic"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}]"
Thus, 5T4 molecules can deliver signals through both the extracellular and intracellular domains, and the resultant effects are consistent with a role for 5T4 molecules in invasion processes.

We now present evidence that caeruloplasmin, the major plasma copper - carrying protein, is present in the liver in Wilson ' s disease, and thus that reduced circulating levels of the protein result from a post - translational defect in the secretory pathway.	"plasma	55	61	Anatomy"	"liver	107	112	Anatomy"	"[{""token"": ""plasma"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""liver"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}]"
The presence of this form of caeruloplasmin in Wilson ' s disease liver suggests that a related post - translational defect may also be responsible for its absence from bile in Wilson ' s disease.

The experimental studies in vitro and in vivo were performed to investigate the effects of carcinostatic agents in the adhesion of cancer cells to endothelial cells.	"cancer cells	131	143	Anatomy"	"endothelial cells	147	164	Anatomy"	"[{""token"": ""cancer cells"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""endothelial cells"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 164, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}]"
Certain carcinostatic agents induce the expression of E - selectin on endothelial cells and enhance the expression of carbohydrate ligands on cancer cells.	"endothelial cells	70	87	Anatomy"	"cancer cells	142	154	Anatomy"	"[{""token"": ""endothelial cells"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""cancer cells"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}]"
Consequently, increased adhesion of cancer cells to endothelial cells was observed by the treatment of carcinostatic agents.

From the above, we concluded that carcinostatic agents may increase the metastatic ability of cancer cells in patients with cancer.

To determine the potency of 2, 3, 3 ', 4, 4 ' - pentachlorobiphenyl ( PCB 105) for producing reproductive and developmental toxicity, adult ring - necked pheasant hens ( Phasianus colchicus) were orally dosed with 0, 0. 06, 0. 6, or 6 mg PCB 105 / kg hen / week for 10 weeks to achieve cumulative doses of 0, 0. 6, 6, or 60 mg PCB 105 / kg hen after which hens were bred with untreated roosters once per week for 8 weeks.

Only preload significantly influenced pump flow rate at the t - point from among preload ( LVEDP), afterload ( SAoP), and contractility ( max LV dP / dt), by which we can simulate Starling ' s law of the natural heart.
