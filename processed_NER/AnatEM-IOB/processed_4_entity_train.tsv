For example, although aspirin is a generally well - tolerated pain reliever and is increasingly advocated as a preventative tool for heart attacks and colorectal cancer ( Vainio and Miller 2003; Werner et al. 2004), it is also linked to increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, cerebral hemorrhage ( Werner et al. 2004), and asthma attacks ( Jenkins et al. 2004).

Culturing activated NK cells with DCs at low NK / DC ratios ( 1: 5) led to increases in TNF - alpha production, which were augmented dramatically by the addition of suboptimal doses ( 10 ng / ml) of LPS ( Fig. 2 A).
