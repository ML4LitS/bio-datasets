For the purpose of investigating the relationship between the metastatic potential of the tumor as well as the expression of nm23 - H1 mRNA, and for determing the location of the positive sites in the cells, tumor metastasis suppressor gene nm23 - H1 in human hepatocellular carcinoma ( and the nonneoplastic area surrounding the tumor) was detected by in situ hybridization using digoxiginin - labeled nm23 - H1 antisense complementary RNA probe.

The primary results indicated ( i) positive results of in situ hybridization are presence of granules or masses in the cytoplasm; ( ii) the less expression of nm23 - H1 mRNA, the higher metastatic rate of the human hepatocellular carcinoma ( P < 0. 05); ( iii) expression of nm23 - H1 mRNA dose not correlate with some other factors such as tumor size and the background of other liver diseases.
