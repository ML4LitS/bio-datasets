CSC - high cultures and tumors expressed increased levels of the proangiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor and stromal - derived factor 1, and when signaling by either factor was blocked, all aspects of angiogenesis observed in CSC - high cultures and tumors, including microvessel density, perfusion, EPC mobilization / recruitment, and stimulation of endothelial cell activity, were reduced to levels comparable with those observed in CSC - low cultures / tumors.

METHODS: The expression of five facilitative glucose transporters, Glut - 1 ( erythrocyte type), Glut - 2 ( liver type), Glut - 3 ( brain type), Glut - 4 ( muscle / fat type), and Glut - 5 ( small intestine type), was studied by immunohistochemistry of paraffin sections from 12 primary human breast cancers and 8 lymph node metastases from 2 patients.
