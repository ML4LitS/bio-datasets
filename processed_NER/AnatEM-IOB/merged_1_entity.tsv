We have previously shown that massive apoptosis occurs when wild - type p53 or E2F - 1 expression is induced in glioma.	glioma,112,118,Anatomy	"[{""token"": ""glioma"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}]"	test
Adenovirus - mediated p53 gene transfer is ineffective in causing apoptosis in glioma cells that retain wild - type p53 genotype or overexpress the p21 protein.	glioma cells,79,91,Anatomy	"[{""token"": ""glioma cells"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}]"	test
The p16 / Rb / E2F pathway is the most frequent target of genetic alterations in gliomas, and therefore constitutes a suitable target for gene therapy strategies.	gliomas,81,88,Anatomy	"[{""token"": ""gliomas"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}]"	test
However, the transfer of either the p16 or Rb gene to glioma cells results in cytostatic effect.	glioma cells,54,66,Anatomy	"[{""token"": ""glioma cells"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}]"	test
The E2F - 1 protein is able to induce generalized apoptosis in gliomas independently of the p53, p16 or Rb status.	gliomas,63,70,Anatomy	"[{""token"": ""gliomas"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}]"	test
In addition, p21 - or p16 - mediated growth arrest did not protect glioma cells from E2F - 1 - mediated apoptosis.	glioma cells,67,79,Anatomy	"[{""token"": ""glioma cells"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}]"	test
The apoptotic molecule bax is induced in p53 - mediated apoptosis, but bax is not induced in E2F - 1 - mediated apoptosis in glioma cells.	glioma cells,125,137,Anatomy	"[{""token"": ""glioma cells"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}]"	test
Careful selection of patients may be necessary before designing therapeutic strategies using either p53 or E2F - 1 as a therapeutic tools for glioma patients.	glioma,142,148,Anatomy	"[{""token"": ""glioma"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}]"	test

In support of this hypothesis, other treatments which act through different mechanisms to interfere with protein processing ( i. e., tunicamycin, brefeldin A, and azetidine) were also found to be much more toxic for VHL - deficient cells.	cells,232,237,Anatomy	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 232, ""end_span"": 237, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}]"	test
