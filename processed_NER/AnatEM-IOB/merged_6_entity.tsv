To investigate the potential role of sympathetic nerves in preventing pronounced increases in cerebral blood flow, we evaluated the effects of abrupt hypertension on the cerebral circulation of newborn pigs with intact cerebral sympathetic innervation and after cerebral sympathetic denervation.	sympathetic nerves,37,55,Anatomy	cerebral,94,102,Anatomy	blood,103,108,Anatomy	cerebral,170,178,Anatomy	cerebral,219,227,Anatomy	cerebral,262,270,Anatomy	"[{""token"": ""sympathetic nerves"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""cerebral"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""blood"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""cerebral"", ""start_span"": 170, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""cerebral"", ""start_span"": 219, ""end_span"": 227, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""cerebral"", ""start_span"": 262, ""end_span"": 270, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}]"	test
They defined also the predominant origin of new vessels from venules and capillaries, and enabled the evolution of proliferating vessels into arterioles and venules to be documented.	vessels,48,55,Anatomy	venules,61,68,Anatomy	capillaries,73,84,Anatomy	vessels,129,136,Anatomy	arterioles,142,152,Anatomy	venules,157,164,Anatomy	"[{""token"": ""vessels"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""venules"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""capillaries"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""vessels"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""arterioles"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""venules"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 164, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}]"	test
All of the 14 cases of primary GB cancer ( 10 masses, 4 thickening wall) were found to have a high velocity arterial blood flow signal in the wall of the GB.	primary GB cancer,23,40,Anatomy	masses,46,52,Anatomy	wall,67,71,Anatomy	arterial blood,108,122,Anatomy	wall,142,146,Anatomy	GB,154,156,Anatomy	"[{""token"": ""primary GB cancer"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""masses"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""wall"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""arterial blood"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""wall"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""GB"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}]"	test
