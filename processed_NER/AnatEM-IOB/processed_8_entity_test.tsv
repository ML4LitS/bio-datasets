In the fetal GK / Par rat exposed to mild hyperglycemia during gestation ( a model of IUED), data from our group suggest that the beta - cell deficit ( reduced by more than 50%) starts as early as fetal age E16 and reflects decreased beta - cell proliferation, a limitation of beta - cell neogenesis from precursors, and increased apoptosis of both beta cells and their precursors [ 86].
