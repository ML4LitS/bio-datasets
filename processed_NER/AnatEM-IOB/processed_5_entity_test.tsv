Patterns of X - chromosome inactivation, mutations in the K - ras gene, mutations or allelic loss of the p53 gene, or human papillomavirus detection were identical in both endometrial and ovarian lesions in three of the cases suggesting that those three cases represented single primary tumors with metastases.

The present studies examine whether lymphocyte stimulation via cells engineered to secrete GM - CSF or IL - 2 decreases hepatic tumor growth, and whether stimulation of both macrophages and lymphocytes is more effective than either individually.
