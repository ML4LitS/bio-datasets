By comparing the signs of inflammation and the degree of hyperplasia of the enterochromaffin cells ( EC) in duodenal biopsies obtained from patients with presumed post - infectious functional dyspepsia ( PI - FD) and unspecified - onset functional dyspepsia ( U - FD), they showed that PI - FD is associated with persistence of focal T - cell aggregates, decrease in CD4 + cells and increased macrophage counts surrounding the crypts, without any significant differences in the numbers of EC or chromogranin A ( CA) - positive cells ( mast cells).

Here, we discuss the possibility for MMPs to contribute to pericyte recruitment at six levels: ( 1) direct promotion of pericyte invasion by extracellular matrix degradation; ( 2) stimulation of pericyte proliferation and protection against apoptosis by modification of the ECM; ( 3) activation of pericytes through the release of growth factor bound to the ECM; ( 4) transactivation of angiogenic cell surface receptor; ( 5) propagation of angiogenic signalling as cofactor; and ( 6) recruitment of bone marrow - derived stem cells.

Rather, it has been hypothesized that, at low concentrations, MBDs produce more subtle effects on microtubule dynamics, block critical cell signaling pathways, and prevent the microtubules from properly interacting with transient subcellular assemblies ( focal adhesions and adherens junctions) whose subsequent stabilization and / or maturation are required for cell motility and cell - cell interactions.
