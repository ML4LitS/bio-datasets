We reasoned that activated NK cells would be more useful for these experiments because ( i) an encounter in vivo between NK cells that normally traffic in the blood ( 4) and iDCs which reside in the tissues ( 1, 3), should only occur when both cells are activated; ( ii) activated NK cells mediate more potent lysis of iDCs ( 11 - 13), thereby allowing for a more rigorous examination of a potential cytotoxic effect; and ( iii) the number of NK cells obtained after short - term in vitro culture would be far greater providing more cells for analysis ( 9).

This study shows that angiogenin expression is up - regulated in the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments in in situ carcinoma and invasive carcinoma compared with normal breast tissue and that angiogenin expression in invasive carcinomas is significantly positively associated with high tumour grade ( p = 0. 03), positive oestrogen receptor ( ER) status ( p = 0. 01), HIF - 1 alpha ( p = 0. 001) and DEC 1 ( p = 0. 001), but not with patient age ( p = 0. 8), tumour size ( p = 0. 25), lymph node status ( p = 0. 69), epidermal growth factor receptor ( p = 0. 56) or microvessel density ( p = 0. 32).	cytoplasmic,69,80,Anatomy	nuclear compartments,85,105,Anatomy	in situ carcinoma,109,126,Anatomy	invasive carcinoma,131,149,Anatomy	breast tissue,171,184,Anatomy	invasive carcinomas,219,238,Anatomy	tumour,288,294,Anatomy	tumour,461,467,Anatomy	lymph node,487,497,Anatomy	microvessel,568,579,Anatomy	"[{""token"": ""cytoplasmic"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""nuclear compartments"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""in situ carcinoma"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""invasive carcinoma"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""breast tissue"", ""start_span"": 171, ""end_span"": 184, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""invasive carcinomas"", ""start_span"": 219, ""end_span"": 238, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 288, ""end_span"": 294, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""tumour"", ""start_span"": 461, ""end_span"": 467, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""lymph node"", ""start_span"": 487, ""end_span"": 497, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""microvessel"", ""start_span"": 568, ""end_span"": 579, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}]"	train
