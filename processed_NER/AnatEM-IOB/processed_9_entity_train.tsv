The motivational neural reward anticipation signal presumably activates the reward network including the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, the more ventral and dorsal striatum ( nucleus accumbens, putamen, and caudate), leading to an release of caudate / SNr inhibition on the executive oculomotor structure superior colliculus.

AIF is required for oxidative phosphorylation and for the assembly and / or stabilization of respiratory complex I. 41 Upon induction of apoptosis, AIF is cleaved and released into the cytosol, where it translocates to the nucleus and mediates chromatin condensation and large - scale DNA fragmentation. 41 However, this well - known pro - apoptotic action of AIF is in conflict with the observation that AIF is essential for the maintenance of normal heart function and its inactivation results in dilated C. 42 Moreover, cardiac myocytes isolated from a mouse model with 80% reduction in AIF levels manifested increased cell death induced by oxidative stress, and the hearts of these mice displayed enhanced ischemic damage after in vivo I / R. 43 Although it has been described that AIF is released from cardiac myocyte mitochondria during I / R, its contribution to I / R - induced apoptosis was discounted. 38 However, AIF has been implicated in cardiac myocyte death induced by oxidative stress and HF. 44	"cytosol	185	192	Anatomy"	"nucleus	223	230	Anatomy"	"chromatin	244	253	Anatomy"	"heart	452	457	Anatomy"	"cardiac myocytes	523	539	Anatomy"	"cell	622	626	Anatomy"	"hearts	670	676	Anatomy"	"cardiac myocyte mitochondria	807	835	Anatomy"	"cardiac myocyte	951	966	Anatomy"	"[{""token"": ""cytosol"", ""start_span"": 185, ""end_span"": 192, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""nucleus"", ""start_span"": 223, ""end_span"": 230, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""chromatin"", ""start_span"": 244, ""end_span"": 253, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""heart"", ""start_span"": 452, ""end_span"": 457, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""cardiac myocytes"", ""start_span"": 523, ""end_span"": 539, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 622, ""end_span"": 626, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""hearts"", ""start_span"": 670, ""end_span"": 676, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""cardiac myocyte mitochondria"", ""start_span"": 807, ""end_span"": 835, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""cardiac myocyte"", ""start_span"": 951, ""end_span"": 966, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}]"
