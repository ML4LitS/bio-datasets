PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using a custom microarray, we analyzed 72 primary PETs, seven matched metastases, and 10 normal pancreatic samples.

To examine this hypothesis, we used NCI - H1299 non - small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) cell line ( p53 and PTEN null cell) and constructed an ICAM - 3 - over - expressing stable transfectant, which exhibited increased cell migration and invasion.

We also showed ICAM - 3 - induced cell migration and invasion in NCI - H460 NSCLC cells ( wild - type p53 and PTEN cell) through the same signaling pathway.

Taken together, our findings suggest that ICAM - 3 stimulates cancer cell migration / invasion via ICAM - 3 / Akt / CREB / MMP pathway regardless of p53 and PTEN status, and this reflects the possibility that ICAM - 3 could be considered as a candidate for anti - cancer drug development and as a cancer diagnostic marker.
