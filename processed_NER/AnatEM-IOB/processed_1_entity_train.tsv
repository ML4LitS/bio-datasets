The observation however that older adults and PD patients can use this intact neural representation of reward anticipation ( a positive motivational incentive) to optimize their preparatory processes, cannot necessarily be generalized to cognitive contexts with negative motivational incentives.	"neural	78	84	Anatomy"	"[{""token"": ""neural"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}]"
Samanez - Larkin et al. ( 2010) recently showed that older adults were not able to optimally use their intact neural reward anticipation system in risky financial decision making.	"neural	110	116	Anatomy"	"[{""token"": ""neural"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}]"
The impact of negative incentives might be an intriguing question for future research, as due to the decreased activation of the neural loss anticipation system ( Samanez - Larkin et al., 2007) together with the observed differential attentional bias for negative and positive information ( Mather and Carstensen, 2003), it seems likely that negative motivational incentives, i. e., the prospect of loss, might have a different impact on action preparation in older adults than in the young.	"neural	129	135	Anatomy"	"[{""token"": ""neural"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}]"

When the formation of associations is weakened, it could appear as a failure to capitalize on the neural reward anticipation system, whereas it represents an indirect effect of non - available reward associations in working memory when preparing the response.

Future investigations should examine whether the observed effects are specific for the current task or generalize to other tasks that show age - and PD - related cognitive decrements ( e. g., in task switching) and have been related to dopaminergic denervation in the caudate ( e. g., impaired verbal episodic memory, attention, and response inhibition; Rinne et al., 2000; Bruck et al., 2005).

Sunitinib induces apoptosis in pheochromocytoma tumor cells by inhibiting VEGFR2 / Akt / mTOR / S6K1 pathways through modulation of Bcl - 2 and BAD.

Furthermore, in support of these findings, we found that sunitinib induced a reduction in the expression of the antiapoptotic molecule Bcl - 2 as well as dephosphorylation of the proapoptotic molecule BAD, which results in the activation of BAD in these cells.

Thus, these results together suggest that sunitinib initially exerts its apoptotic effect through the inhibition of VEGFR - 2, which, when followed by reduction of its downstream effectors, including Akt / mTOR / S6K1, may lead to inhibition of the antiapoptotic molecule Bcl - 2 and activation of the proapoptotic molecule BAD in PC12 cells.

Selective inhibition of the renal dopamine subtype D1A receptor induces antinatriuresis in conscious rats.	"renal	28	33	Anatomy"	"[{""token"": ""renal"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}]"
Both dopamine D1 - like ( D1A and D1B) and D2 - like ( D2, D3, and D4) receptor subfamilies are present in the kidney.	"kidney	111	117	Anatomy"	"[{""token"": ""kidney"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}]"
In the present study, the effect of selective inhibition of the renal D1A receptor with phosphorothioated antisense oligodeoxynucleotide ( AS - ODN) was investigated in conscious uninephrectomized rats.

Systolic blood pressure remained unchanged.	"blood	9	14	Anatomy"	"[{""token"": ""blood"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}]"
The renal D1A receptor protein was significantly decreased by 35% and 46% at the end of the study in AS - ODN - treated rats on normal and high salt intake, respectively, whereas the D1B receptor and beta - actin were not affected.
