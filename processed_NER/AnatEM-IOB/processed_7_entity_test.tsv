Promoter region hypermethylation was significantly more common ( P < 0. 008) in breast and ovarian cancer ( 6 / 38 tumours methylated) than in colon cancer ( 0 / 35 tumours methylated) or in leukaemias ( 0 / 19 samples methylated).

The caprine placenta is usually considered to have increased interhemal distance compared with endotheliochorial and hemochorial types: our results suggest that the very extensive development of sinusoids and crypts may compensate for any negative consequences of the placental architecture.

Now, by competition experiments with a panel of different unlabelled cells we show that the VCSA expressed on RSV - transformed hamster fibroblasts is a complex of at least three distinct antigenic specificities: ( 1) one expressed on all RSV - transformed fibroblasts, regardless their species and the subgroup or strain of the transforming virus; ( 2) one cross - reacting with a cell - surface antigen ( CSA) expressed at various degrees on untransformed avian fibroblasts, but not on mammalian fibroblasts; ( 3) one species - specific, present only on RSV - transformed hamster fibroblasts.

The apparent mesenchymal to epithelial conversion of the tumor cells mimics the conversion that occurs during embryonic kidney development, suggesting that Met - HGF / SF signaling plays a role in this process as well as in tumors that express both epithelial and mesenchymal markers.
