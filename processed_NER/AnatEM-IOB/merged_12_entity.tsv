Several possible explanations for the relationship of these changes to the enhancement of DMBA carcinogenesis include: radiation blocking normal capillary proliferative and / or dilatory responses to inflammation secondary to neoplastic changes; radiation - induced focal increases in the pericapillary connective tissue histohematic barrier, stimulating angiogenesis but reducing nutrient diffusion; radiation exposures sensitizing vascular endothelium to subsequent angiogenic stimulation from premalignant tissues; DMBA vascular and epithelial effects partially or completely blocking radiation effects on epithelial and / or endothelial cells; and radiation damage to vessel walls partially or fully inhibiting normal physiologic mechanisms of repairing DMBA damage to the vessels.	capillary,145,154,Anatomy	neoplastic,226,236,Anatomy	pericapillary connective tissue,289,320,Anatomy	histohematic barrier,321,341,Anatomy	vascular endothelium,433,453,Anatomy	premalignant tissues,496,516,Anatomy	vascular,523,531,Anatomy	epithelial,536,546,Anatomy	epithelial,609,619,Anatomy	endothelial cells,629,646,Anatomy	vessel walls,672,684,Anatomy	vessels,777,784,Anatomy	"[{""token"": ""capillary"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""neoplastic"", ""start_span"": 226, ""end_span"": 236, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""pericapillary connective tissue"", ""start_span"": 289, ""end_span"": 320, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""histohematic barrier"", ""start_span"": 321, ""end_span"": 341, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""vascular endothelium"", ""start_span"": 433, ""end_span"": 453, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""premalignant tissues"", ""start_span"": 496, ""end_span"": 516, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""vascular"", ""start_span"": 523, ""end_span"": 531, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""epithelial"", ""start_span"": 536, ""end_span"": 546, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""epithelial"", ""start_span"": 609, ""end_span"": 619, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""endothelial cells"", ""start_span"": 629, ""end_span"": 646, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""vessel walls"", ""start_span"": 672, ""end_span"": 684, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""vessels"", ""start_span"": 777, ""end_span"": 784, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}]"	test
