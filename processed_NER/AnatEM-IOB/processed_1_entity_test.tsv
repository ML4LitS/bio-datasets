To test this hypothesis more directly, we analyzed whether Eph forward signaling can still suppress BDNF - stimulated IEG induction and growth cone collapse when ERK kinase activity was experimentally raised.

In agreement with previous results ( Fig. 4), in mock - electroporated neurons, ephrin - A5 incubation reduced the BDNF - mediated up - regulation of c - fos ( Fig. 6A), Egr1 ( Fig. 6B), Egr2 ( Fig. 6C) and Arc ( Fig. 6D) mRNA.

Short - term stimulation with guidance cues did not result in major alterations of cytoskeletal mRNA levels except for upregulation of Tpm1 by ephrin - A5 ( Fig. S4A).	"cytoskeletal	83	95	Anatomy"	"[{""token"": ""cytoskeletal"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}]"

In contrast to the antagonistic impact on the IEG gene response ( Figs. 4 and 6), ephrin - A5 and BDNF resulted in rather synergistic action on cytoskeletal gene expression.

In the same way of thinking, studies have demonstrated that the maintenance of methylated histone H3 Lys4 by Set7 / 9, a member of the SET methyltransferase family, is crucial to Pdx1 activity in beta - cell lines [ 111 - 113].
