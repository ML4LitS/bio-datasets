Several possible explanations for the relationship of these changes to the enhancement of DMBA carcinogenesis include: radiation blocking normal capillary proliferative and / or dilatory responses to inflammation secondary to neoplastic changes; radiation - induced focal increases in the pericapillary connective tissue histohematic barrier, stimulating angiogenesis but reducing nutrient diffusion; radiation exposures sensitizing vascular endothelium to subsequent angiogenic stimulation from premalignant tissues; DMBA vascular and epithelial effects partially or completely blocking radiation effects on epithelial and / or endothelial cells; and radiation damage to vessel walls partially or fully inhibiting normal physiologic mechanisms of repairing DMBA damage to the vessels.
