The plausibility of the existence of more than one 5 - HT receptor type in the ciliary body is confirmed by intraocular pressure ( IOP) experiments.

The presence of both receptors in the ciliary body would certainly provide an explanation for the shallow displacement curves observed in [ 3H] 5 - HT binding studies with the tissue [ 110], since this ligand can be used to label both receptors.

The agonism of 5 - HT1A receptors, negatively coupled to cAMP, reduces IOP by decreasing the production of aqueous humor, like beta - receptor antagonists which, diminishing the content of cAMP at the postjunctional site, lowers the aqueous humor secretion with a consequent decrease in IOP [ 98].	"aqueous humor	107	120	Anatomy"	"aqueous humor	233	246	Anatomy"	"[{""token"": ""aqueous humor"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}, {""token"": ""aqueous humor"", ""start_span"": 233, ""end_span"": 246, ""type"": ""Anatomy""}]"
Studies with ketanserin have demonstrated that, when orally or topically applied, it lowers IOP in animals, healthy volunteers and in glaucomatous patients [ 26, 34, 37, 64, 75, 88, 113, 126].

However, data from human studies conducted after oral or topical administration of ketanserin, in which were determined the variations of IOP, total outflow facility and pupil diameter, demonstrated that the alpha1 - adrenoreceptor blocking effect exerted by ketanserin should represent a further aspect of its mechanism of action, probably due to a functional sharing of these receptors [ 64, 87].

Lastly, already in 1992 Martin and co - workers showed the occurrence of a significant correlation between the content of serotonin in the aqueous humor and IOP in the human eye [ 85].

In fact, one of the function correlate to 5 - HT7 receptor activation includes smooth muscle relaxation observed in a variety of isolated tissue preparations, in which elevation of cAMP concentration was also detected [ 3, 44].

This hypothesized mechanism of action is also supported by the fact that various other receptor types, also positively coupled to cAMP, in the iris cause relaxation of the sphincter muscle [ 1, 28].

From these results, it was suggested that PPARgamma activation might suppress COX - 2 expression via the nuclear factor - kappaB pathway in the ovarian carcinoma cells and that low expression of PPARgamma and high expression of COX - 2 might be involved in carcinogenesis and progression of ovarian tumours.

Repetitive cycles of hypoxia and reoxygenation associated with changes in synovial perfusion are postulated to activate hypoxia - inducible factor - 1alpha and nuclear factor - kappaB, two key transcription factors that are regulated by changes in cellular oxygenation and cytokine stimulation, and that in turn orchestrate the expression of a spectrum of genes critical to the persistence of synovitis.

The Kaposi ' s sarcoma - associated herpesvirus ( KSHV) encodes a G protein - coupled receptor ( vGPCR) that has been implicated in the initiation of Kaposi ' s sarcoma, identifying vGPCR as an attractive target for preventing Kaposi ' s sarcoma.

Here we show that angiogenesis is severely impaired in PSMA - null animals and that this angiogenic defect occurs at the level of endothelial cell invasion through the extracellular matrix barrier.

PURPOSE: We prepared tumor endothelium targeted cRGD - modified heparin derivative ( cRGD - HL) by coupling heparin - lithocholic acid ( HL) with cRGDyK, and evaluated inhibition effects of cRGD - HL on angiogenesis and tumor growth.

METHODS: To evaluate antiangiogenic activity of cRGD - HL, we performed tests on endothelial cell adhesion and migration to vitronectin, tube formation, binding affinity to purified alpha ( v) beta ( 3) integrin, and in vivo Matrigel plug assay.

It was thought that potent antiangiogenic effect of cRGD - HL was probably due to the interference of alpha ( v) beta ( 3) - mediated interaction, resulting in the enhanced antitumoral activity against SCC7 tumor.

Murine Langerin - diphtheria toxin receptor ( DTR) mice allow for the inducible elimination of LCs and Langerin ( +) dermal dendritic cells ( dDCs) after administration of diphtheria toxin, which results in reduced CHS.
