Studies of cell - type - specific STAT3 - deficient mice have shown that STAT3 activation is essential for IL - 10 - mediated anti - inflammatory reactions in macrophages and neutrophils [ 5], but is responsible for IL - 6 - mediated prevention of apoptosis in T cells [ 6].

Cell surface expression of IL - 10R1 is decreased in synovial fluid dendritic cells due to the presence of TNF - alpha, IL - 1, and granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor [ 15].

To examine the effect of IL - 6 on T - cell responsiveness to IL - 10, CD4 + T cells from healthy controls were incubated in culture medium with 10% FCS in the presence or absence of 10 ng / ml IL - 6 ( Becton Dickinson) for 36 hours.

Briefly, the membrane was incubated with the antibodies ( rabbit IgG) anti - STAT1 antibody, anti - phosphorylated tyrosine 701 of STAT1 antibody, anti - STAT3 antibody, and anti - phosphorylated tyrosine 705 of STAT3 antibody, diluted as recommended at 1 / 2000 with Tris - buffered saline with 0. 1% Tween 20 with 5% BSA.

However, RA CD4 + T cells were able to produce significant amounts of IFN - gamma in the presence of 1 ng / ml IL - 10, and the maximal but not complete inhibition by IL - 10 was obtained at 10 - 100 ng / ml.

There were no statistically significant differences in IFN - gamma production without IL - 10 among these three groups ( Fig. 2a), but the inhibitory effect of IL - 10 on IFN - gamma production was significantly limited in the active RA group as compared with the inactive RA group and healthy controls ( percentage decrease: active RA, 2. 9 + / - 14. 4%; inactive RA, 45. 6 + / - 14. 4%; controls, 65. 8 + / - 7. 9%) ( Fig. 2b).

As a consequence, CD4 + T cells from active RA patients produced higher levels of IFN - gamma in the presence of 1 ng / ml IL - 10 than did normal CD4 + T cells ( Fig. 2a).	"CD4	18	21	Protein"	"IFN - gamma	82	93	Protein"	"IL - 10	123	130	Protein"	"CD4	147	150	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IFN - gamma"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In addition, we compared IL - 2 production by CD4 + T cells after CD3 and CD28 costimulation in the presence of IL - 10 in active RA patients and in healthy controls.

To examine whether the resistance to IL - 10 inhibition in RA CD4 + T cells was due to limited receptor expression, the cell surface expression of IL - 10R1 on PB CD4 + T cells from active RA patients and from healthy controls was determined by flow cytometric analysis.	"IL - 10	37	44	Protein"	"CD4	62	65	Protein"	"IL - 10R1	147	156	Protein"	"CD4	163	166	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10R1"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 163, ""end_span"": 166, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The interaction of IL - 10R with IL - 10 induces tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the latent transcription factors STAT1 and STAT3 [ 3].

Macrophage - specific STAT3 - deficient mice demonstrated that STAT3 plays a dominant role in IL - 10 - mediated anti - inflammatory responses [ 5], which has recently been confirmed in human macrophages by studies of dominant - negative STAT3 overexpression [ 30].

The induction of STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation by IL - 10 in PB CD4 + T cells from active RA patients and from healthy controls was examined using western blotting.

Both sustained STAT3 phosphorylation and defective IL - 10 - induced STAT3 phosphorylation were found in RA ST CD4 + T cells ( Fig. 4c).

On the other hand, IL - 10 - induced STAT1 phosphorylation was not detected in either RA CD4 + T cells or normal CD4 + T cells ( Fig. 4a).

IL - 6 - mediated STAT3 phosphorylation and inhibition of IL - 10 effect in normal CD4 + T cells	"IL - 6	0	6	Protein"	"STAT3	18	23	Protein"	"IL - 10	58	65	Protein"	"CD4	83	86	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 6"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 6, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""STAT3"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Both STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation was activated by IL - 6 in normal CD4 + T cells ( data not shown), in agreement with previous observations [ 4].

RA serum was able to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 but not STAT1, and this STAT3 activation was mostly abolished by neutralization of IL - 6 activity ( Fig. 5a).	"STAT3	56	61	Protein"	"STAT1	70	75	Protein"	"STAT3	86	91	Protein"	"IL - 6	145	151	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""STAT3"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""STAT1"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""STAT3"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 6"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We next examined whether IL - 6 could suppress the effect of IL - 10 to inhibit IFN - gamma production by CD4 + T cells.	"IL - 6	25	31	Protein"	"IL - 10	61	68	Protein"	"IFN - gamma	80	91	Protein"	"CD4	106	109	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 6"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IFN - gamma"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Taken together, these findings suggest that persistent exposure to serum IL - 6 may have a role in both the induction of STAT3 activation and the resistance to the inhibitory effect of IL - 10 in RA CD4 + T cells.	"IL - 6	73	79	Protein"	"STAT3	121	126	Protein"	"IL - 10	185	192	Protein"	"CD4	199	202	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 6"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""STAT3"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 185, ""end_span"": 192, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 199, ""end_span"": 202, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The RA CD4 + T cells contained higher levels of SOCS1 but lower levels of SOCS3 transcripts than did control CD4 + T cells ( Fig. 6a).	"CD4	7	10	Protein"	"SOCS1	48	53	Protein"	"SOCS3	74	79	Protein"	"CD4	109	112	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 7, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SOCS1"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SOCS3"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Constitutive expression of SOCS1 mRNA in RA CD4 + T cells was comparable with the expression in normal CD4 + T cells stimulated by 10 ng / ml IL - 6 ( Fig. 6b), supporting its functional significance.	"SOCS1	27	32	Protein"	"CD4	44	47	Protein"	"CD4	103	106	Protein"	"IL - 6	142	148	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SOCS1"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 6"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Defective IL - 10 - induced STAT3 activation therefore appears to be due at least in part to an abundance of SOCS1 in RA CD4 + T cells.	"IL - 10	10	17	Protein"	"STAT3	28	33	Protein"	"SOCS1	109	114	Protein"	"CD4	121	124	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""STAT3"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SOCS1"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
RA CD4 + T cells contain higher levels of SOCS1 but contain lower levels of SOCS3 transcripts in comparison with normal CD4 + T cells.	"CD4	3	6	Protein"	"SOCS1	42	47	Protein"	"SOCS3	76	81	Protein"	"CD4	120	123	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 6, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SOCS1"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SOCS3"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In association with impaired IL - 10 - mediated STAT3 activation, STAT3 was found to be tyrosine phosphorylated persistently ( up to 6 hours) in freshly isolated PB and ST CD4 + T cells from RA patients.	"IL - 10	29	36	Protein"	"STAT3	48	53	Protein"	"STAT3	66	71	Protein"	"CD4	172	175	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""STAT3"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""STAT3"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 172, ""end_span"": 175, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These results suggest that both the sustained STAT3 activation and the resistance to IL - 10 inhibition found in RA CD4 + T cells may be induced after chronic exposure in vivo to high concentrations of serum IL - 6.	"STAT3	46	51	Protein"	"IL - 10	85	92	Protein"	"CD4	116	119	Protein"	"IL - 6	208	214	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""STAT3"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 6"", ""start_span"": 208, ""end_span"": 214, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore, IFN - gamma and IL - 10 produced by CD4 + T cells themselves could be responsible for impaired IL - 10 signaling in the ST, because T - cell infiltrates produce both cytokines [ 34, 35].

IL - 6 is the major STAT3 - activating factor present in synovial fluid, which has a crucial role in the activation of monocyte functions such as gene expression of the Fc gamma receptor type I and type III and of HLA - DR [ 31].

More recently, high levels of activated STAT3, thought to be induced mainly by IL - 6, have been detected in the ST, and STAT3 activation has been shown to be involved in synovial fibroblast proliferation and IL - 6 production [ 37].

Furthermore, the significance of persistent STAT3 signaling in Th1 - cell - dominated autoimmune arthritis has been suggested by studies of the gp130F759 / F759 mice, in which the Src homology phosphatase - 2 binding site of gp130 ( the transmembrane glycoprotein beta subunit of the IL - 6 family cytokine receptor), tyrosine 759, was mutated to phenylalanine [ 39].

In the gp130F759 / F759 mice, T cells, particularly the CD4 + T - cell subset, are chronically activated and resistant to activation - induced cell death through gp130 - mediated STAT3 activation.

We found that CD4 + T cells from patients with active RA expressed higher levels of SOCS1, but lower levels of SOCS3, compared with normal CD4 + T cells.

SOCS1 and SOCS3 are induced by various cytokines, including IL - 6 and IL - 10, as mediators of negative feedback and crosstalk inhibition [ 7].

Although some cytokines ( IL - 15 and IL - 23) have been reported to regulate IL - 17 production, the intracellular signaling pathways that regulate IL - 17 production remain unknown.

Proinflammatory cytokines such as IL - 1 and TNF - alpha are abundant in rheumatoid synovium, whereas the T cell - derived cytokines, especially IL - 4 and interferon - gamma, have often proved difficult to detect in RA synovium [ 24].

For example, IL - 17 stimulates rheumatoid synoviocytes to secrete several cytokines such as IL - 6, IL - 8 and tumor necrosis factor - stimulated gene 6 as well as prostaglandin E2 in vitro [ 12, 28, 29].

There are as yet few data available on the agents that stimulate IL - 17 production in RA, although some cytokines ( IL - 15 and IL - 23) have been known to regulate IL - 17 production [ 13, 14].

Depletion of Sox6 in HeLa cell extracts blocked splicing of multiple substrates, and expression of the HMG domain of either Sox6, Sox9, or Sry in the extracts restored splicing, indicating functional overlap of these proteins [ 7].

The mouse beta - globin genes { epsilony, betah1, beta - major, and beta - minor} are clustered on Chromosome 7 and they are highly homologous to their human counterparts in organizational structure and function [ 22].

To investigate whether Sox6 directly acts on the epsilony gene promoter at the transcriptional level, we used an in vitro transient transfection assay and GM979 cells, a murine erythroleukemic cell line that expresses both epsilony and adult beta globins [ 30].

Two HMG architectural proteins ( distantly related to the Sox family of transcription factors), HMG - I and HMG - Y, were demonstrated to bind to the human adult beta globin silencers ( silencers I and II) and cause bending of the DNA, facilitating the binding of other repressors [ 40].

Because GP induced band shifts to NFkappaB, NFIL - 6 and NFAT sites, but no TNFalpha, IL - 6 or IFNgamma, we hypothesized that the activated transcription factors might bind to sites in the IL - 1RA promoter.

A new kappaB3 site ( - 100 and - 130) within the LRE - 1 [ 30] showed increased binding induced by TSST - 1 ( + 30% vs. control), but GP co - treatment up - regulated the LPS ( + 65% vs. control) - and the TSST - 1 ( + 110% vs. control) - induced binding in a superadditive synergistic fashion, when compared to medium control as well as to LPS, TSST - 1 or GP or the theoretical values of GP / LPS calc. or GP / TSST - 1 calc.

The IL - 8kappaB consensus site exhibits a preferentially p65 binding half site and thus differs from the kappaB half site described for TNFalpha and IL - 1beta [ 27, 40], supporting the idea of regulating NFkappaB binding through combinatorial associations of the subunits and the specific sequence of the decameric kappaB motif [ 41, 42].

A bacterial superantigen like TSST - 1 acts through binding to MHC - II molecules and subsequently the T cell receptor, leading to release of mainly IFNgamma and TNFalpha, the latter via both, PI3K and p38 mitogen - activated kinase signaling [ 44, 45].

Although the number of MIP - 2 positive cells per unit area in the PC region of sTNFp55R - infused animals was significantly lower than that of the saline - infused group due to reduction of the area of vasogenic edema, there was no difference in the number of MIP - 2 positive cells per unit area of vasogenic edema between sTNFp55R - infused animals and saline - infused animals ( Figure 6F).

Therefore, together with reduction in neutrophil infiltration in the PC region of sTNFp55R - infused animals, our findings provide evidence that TNF - alpha may regulate SE - induced neutrophil infiltration at least in the PC via vasogenic edema formation and not via direct TNF - alpha - mediated MIP - 2 expression in astrocytes.

With respect to the phosphorylation of p65 - Thr435 by TNF - alpha [ 39], our findings indicate that TNF - alpha - mediated p65 - Thr435 phosphorylation in endothelial cells may play an important role in vasogenic edema induction via SMI - 71 degradation or its posttranslational dysfunction influencing BBB permeability.

To demonstrate that the impact of NFAT5 silencing on MTb - induced viral replication was a direct effect due to modulation of recruitment of NFAT5 to the HIV - 1 LTR and not due to secondary, NFAT5 - regulated effects, we set out to disrupt NFAT5 binding to the viral LTR in the context of HIV - 1 / MTb co - infection.

Additionally, Tan MC et al. suggested that disruption of CCR5 / CCL5 signaling, either by reducing CCL5 production by tumor cells or by systemic administration of a CCR5 inhibitor ( TAK - 779), reduced Treg ( regulatory T cells) migration to tumors so that tumors are smaller in control mice [ 9].

These data are reminiscent of the observations in L929 cells where the loss of caspase activity in healthy cells is sufficient to trigger necroptosis and prompted us to explore the extrinsic or intrinsic cellular factors that promote necroptosis once caspase - 8 activity, which cleaves and inactivates RIP1 kinase and the RIP1 deubiquitinase CYLD [ 21], [ 22], is removed in L929 cells.

Consistent with a RIP1 - dependent increase in TNFalpha protein ( Fig. S6A, B), we found that TNFalpha mRNA levels increased during necroptosis in L929 cells in a RIP1 ( Fig.	"RIP1	18	22	Protein"	"TNFalpha	47	55	Protein"	"TNFalpha	94	102	Protein"	"RIP1	163	167	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RIP1"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RIP1"", ""start_span"": 163, ""end_span"": 167, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Notably, RIP1 and Akt inhibitors had no effect on the levels of TNFalpha mRNA in control cells or in the cells stimulated with bFGF alone ( Fig. 6A, B, Fig. S6C), suggesting that these kinases specifically mediate necroptosis - dependent increase in TNFalpha synthesis.

Knockdown of Akt isoforms Akt1 and Akt2 or inhibition of Akt prominently suppressed the necroptosis dependent increase in JNK and c - Jun phosphorylation ( Fig. 6E, S6D, E) suggesting that Akt may provide a link between RIP1 and JNK activation.

WW domain - containing oxidoreductase WWOX ( FOR or WOX1) is a proapoptotic protein and is considered as a tumor suppressor.

Intriguingly, overexpressed microRNA - 21 reduces Bax / Bcl - 2 ratio and caspase - 3 activity, thereby blocking TMZ - induced apoptosis ( Shi et al., 2010).

Transiently overexpressed WWOX binds transcription factors AP - 2, p73, and c - Jun and block their nuclear relocation in vitro, which suppresses cancer cell survival ( Salah et al., 2012).

Also, p53 plays a role in controlling cell motility via regulating the expression of smooth muscle alpha - actin ( Comer et al., 1998), collagens IIalpha1 and VIalpha1 ( Sun et al., 1999), and many others.

However, it is not surprising to find that many tumor suppressor proteins, e. g., p53, WWOX, Smad4, PTEN, PP2A, and etc., are significantly upregulated during the early stage of cancer progression ( Lai et al., 2005; Chang et al., unpublished).

WWOX also binds PPxY motif - containing transcription factors, such as RUNX2, c - Jun, and ERBB4, via its first WW domain, and the binding blocks the activity of these proteins by retaining them in the cytoplasm.

Four family members, C / EBP - alpha, C / EBP - beta, C / EBP - delta and C / EBP - epsilon, are present in myeloid cells and play different roles in differentiating myeloid cells depending on the extracellular environment [ 61].

To determine which C / EBP proteins were involved in the formation of the different nucleo - protein complexes, and particularly of the LPS - inducible complex, EMSA was performed after incubating the nucleo - protein complexes with antibodies specific for C / EBP - alpha, C / EBP - beta, C / EBP - delta and C / EBP - epsilon.

These data show an inverse relationship between C / EBP - beta and p - C / EBP - betaT217 recruitment, and indicate that T217 - phosphorylated C / EBP - beta may not be responsible for increased transcription from the SerpinB2 promoter in response to LPS.

Since C / EBP - beta binds to the SerpinB2 proximal promoter in an LPS - inducible manner both in vitro and in vivo, we wanted to address the question of whether C / EBP - beta was an essential factor for driving transcription from the SerpinB2 promoter in cells in response to LPS.

LPS - induced C / EBP - beta was shown to specifically bind the C / EBP response element in the SerpinB2 proximal promoter in vitro and in vivo, and loss of C / EBP - beta abrogates constitutive SerpinB2 gene transcription and the response to LPS.

In a previous microarray expression profiling study, SerpinB2 was identified as gene whose induction in C / EBP - beta - deficient peritoneal macrophages by LPS and IFNgamma was severely impaired compared to wild - type macrophages [ 68].

While C / EBP proteins can act as either homodimers or heterodimers [ 63], we identified C / EBP - beta as the only LPS - inducible C / EBP isoform to bind the SerpinB2 C / EBP response element, suggesting a predominant role for C / EBP - beta in LPS - induced SerpinB2 gene expression.

In contrast, expression of C / EBP - betaS64A significantly enhanced LPS - induced SerpinB2 promoter activity, indicating that phosphorylation of C / EBP - beta at S64 negatively regulates LPS - induced SerpinB2 promoter activity.
