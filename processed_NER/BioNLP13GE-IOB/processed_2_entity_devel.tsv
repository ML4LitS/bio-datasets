The effects of BMP - 6 on normal and neoplastic hematopoietic cells prompted us to investigate the effects of BMP - 6 on normal human B cells.

The BMP - 6 effects could be reversed by addition of the extracellular inhibitor Noggin ( Figure 1D).

Interestingly, BMP - 6 showed a small, but reproducible mean increase of cell death from 17 to 23% ( n = 5; p < = 0, 003) in anti - IgM stimulated CD27 + memory B cells.

In contrast, cell death of total CD19 + cells ( n = 6; p < = 0, 32; data not shown) or CD27 - IgG - naive B cells was not significantly affected ( n = 5; p < = 0, 65, figure 2).

Furthermore, we also tested whether other known downstream signalling pathways of BMP - 6 could be triggered by BMP - 6 in human B cells.

BMP - 6 induces upregulation of Id1	"BMP - 6	0	7	Protein"	"Id1	32	35	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Id1"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The amount of Id1 - Id4 mRNA was quantified by real - time RT - PCR.	"Id1	14	17	Protein"	"Id4	20	23	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Id1"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Id4"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Interestingly, we observed a specific four - fold upregulation of Id1 mRNA in BMP - 6 - treated B cells ( Figure 7).

The up - regulation of Id1 mRNA was characteristic of an early inducible gene, with maximal upregulation two hours after the addition of BMP - 6 and returned to baseline after 24 hours.

The increase in Id1 protein level was detectable after one hour and increased until 24 hours after BMP - 6 addition, showing a 16 - fold upregulation compared with t0 ( p < = 0. 020, n = 4) ( Figure 8 and 9).

The fact that BMP - 6 has been reported to act as an autocrine stimulator in chondrocytes [ 18] and ovarium [ 19], prompted us to investigate whether normal human B cells could produce BMP - 6 upon stimulation.

However, in our hands these anti - BMP - 6 antibodies did only recognize the recombinant BMP - 6 protein and not the native protein.

The present study demonstrated a significant antiproliferative effect of BMP - 6 in peripheral blood CD19 + B cells.

Additionally, BMP - 6 induced cell death in CD27 + memory B cells as well as in a Burkitt lymphoma cell line ( Ramos).

Importantly, the anti - proliferative effect of BMP - 6 could be completely neutralized by the use of a natural inhibitor, Noggin.

This is in line with others, showing that Noggin can function as a BMP - 6 antagonist [ 21, 22].	"Noggin	42	48	Protein"	"BMP - 6	67	74	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Noggin"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore, BMP - 2 has been shown to induce activation of STAT3 in myeloma cells [ 9].

In the present study, we were not able to detect BMP - 6 - induced changes in the phosphorylation status of STAT3 or p38 in human peripheral B cells.

It will therefore be important to further elucidate the role of Id - 1 in human B cells by selective over expression or inhibition of Id - 1 gene expression.

Given the role of BMP - 6 in mature human B cells demonstrated here, identification of BMP - 6 producing cells in vivo with possibility of interaction with naive and memory B cells might contribute to the understanding of mature B cell biology.

We analysed the expression BMP - 6 mRNA in peripheral blood B cells by real - time PCR, and report here the upregulation of endogenous BMP - 6 transcripts after stimulation with FCS, human AB - serum and, most importantly, anti - IgM.

However, our attempts to study BMP - 6 protein levels were unsuccessful due to problems with unspecific binding of the anti - BMP - 6 antibodies tested, and lack of specific staining in control cells known to express BMP - 6 mRNA.

The possibility of BMP - 6 production in human B - cells is in line with a recent work that reported the production of BMP - 6 in mouse B cells, infiltrating the bone marrow of mice with inflammatory arthritis [ 43].

Furthermore, it is noteworthy that human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC) highly express BMP - 6 mRNA [ 52], and vascular endothelium has been reported to produce BMP - 6 [ 53].

In conclusion, our results show that BMP - 6 induces activation of intracellular Smad signalling in mature human B - cells with consecutive production of Id1 protein.

Furthermore, we report that BMP - 6 has an antiproliferative effect in B cells stimulated with anti - IgM alone or the combined action of anti - IgM and CD40L.

Interestingly, deamination seems not to be the only A3G - mediated antiviral mechanism; in the case of hepatitis B virus ( HBV) and human T cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV - 1), A3G was shown to restrict virus replication by deamination - independent mechanisms ( 12, 13, 19, 22 - 25).

Luciferase assays revealed a ~ 20 - fold increased transcriptional activity of the 1025 bp sequence as compared to the empty vector, indicating that we had identified an active A3G promoter sequence ( Figure 3B).

This resulted in a 71% reduction of the transcriptional activity compared to the unmodified 180 bp promoter ( Figure 5A) and this value was only marginally higher than the luciferase activity of the 150 bp fragment, indicating that the identified motif is essential for basal activity of the A3G core promoter.

To investigate whether the GC - box represents a binding site for the transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3, we performed EMSA analyses with nuclear extracts isolated from A3. 01 T cells.	"Sp1	92	95	Protein"	"Sp3	100	103	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sp1"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Sp3"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In order to characterize the complexes, we performed supershift experiments using Sp1 - and Sp3 - specific antibodies.	"Sp1	82	85	Protein"	"Sp3	92	95	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sp1"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Sp3"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The upper of the complexes that appeared in combination with the Sp1cons or APO - Sp1 / 3 probes, shifted in the presence of the Sp1 antibody ( Figure 6B, lanes 3 and 7), whereas the lower complex shifted in the presence of the Sp3 antibody ( Figure 6B, lanes 4 and 8).

This resulted in a 31 - 43% reduction of luciferase activity in the presence of Sp1 - or Sp3 - specific siRNA compared to the control siRNA.

This is surprising, since IFN - alpha - inducible signaling cascades are present in A3. 01 T cells: we showed that the control plasmid harboring interferon - responsive GAS elements was markedly induced by IFN - alpha treatment.

In contrast, the GAS element was not responsive to IFN - gamma treatment in these cells, suggesting that our T cell line was not able to mediate IFN - gamma - induced signals.

The HIV - 1 Vif protein is neutralizing the antiviral function of A3G by a multitude of ways.

The question whether Vif alters transcription controlled by the A3G promoter has not been analyzed so far.

Our analysis indicates that transcription from the A3G promoter is unaffected by Vif or other HIV - 1 proteins.

This GC - box is essential for basal promoter activity, since changing the motif to TGTTCGGGAC by introducing two point mutations strongly reduced A3G promoter activity.	"TGTTCGGGAC	84	94	Protein"	"A3G	147	150	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TGTTCGGGAC"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""A3G"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Supershift analysis showed that the transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3 which are ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells, bind specifically to the identified motif.

This observation is consistent with the results of the 5 ' - RACE, since Sp1 is known to play an important role for RNA polymerase II to bind to the transcription initiation site in TATA - boxless promoters and is associated with multiple transcription initiation sites ( 54 - 56).	"Sp1	73	76	Protein"	"RNA polymerase II	116	133	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sp1"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RNA polymerase II"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Whereas Sp1 typically acts as an activator, Sp3 can serve as a repressor or activator ( 57).

Although siRNAs directed against Sp1 or Sp3 significantly reduced transcription controlled by the 180 bp promoter, transcriptional activity was not reduced to the level of the 150 bp fragment.

This can be explained by the remaining low amounts of Sp1 / Sp3 proteins which can be seen in the western blot analysis.

Our results also provide information about the regulation of APOBEC3F ( A3F), another member of the human APOBEC3 family.

A3F is expressed in many human tissues that also express A3G and both proteins have been shown to form heteromultimers, which are most likely generated through binding to an RNA intermediate ( 26, 29, 30).

A3F only differs in 16 nt from the 560 nt upstream of the TSS of A3G ( GenBank ( TM) DQ146365 and DQ147772).

The 180 - bp core promoter region, which we identified for A3G has 100% identity with the A3F sequence.

A GC - box is crucial to the function of the core promoter and represents a binding site for Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors.

Our results can serve as a basis for future studies aimed at understanding how A3G and A3F expression is controlled in different tissues and how these restriction factors can be used to develop novel therapeutic strategies against HIV - 1 infection.

Another recently proposed PKD1 substrate is HSP27 [ 24], a small heat shock protein involved in regulating cell migration and cell survival [ 25].

Previously, we have demonstrated that phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of class II histone deacetylases ( HDACs) during BCR engagement is defective in PKD1 / 3 - / - B cells and can restored upon re - expression of a single PKD isoform [ 1].

Significantly, doxycycline - induced expression of the Flag - PKD3 transgene in the double knockout cells was sufficient to restore normal regulation of HSP27 phosphorylation ( Fig. 1C).

In contrast, expression of a kinase - deficient PKD3 mutant protein in the double knockout cells was not able to restore BCR - or phorbol ester - induced HSP27 phosphorylation ( Fig. 1D).

Furthermore, the viability of PKD1 / 3 - / - B cells during routine culturing was not significantly different from that of wild - type B cells ( data not shown).

PKD enzymes, specifically PKD1 and PKD2, have previously been linked to a protective role against oxidative stress - induced injury in 3T3 fibroblast, HeLa and epithelial cell lines [ 17, 30 - 32].

2B, loss of PKD1 / 3 expression had no significant impact on the survival of DT40 B cells in response to mitochondrial stress stimuli ( H2O2 or serum deprivation); DNA damaging agents ( etoposide or doxorubicin); ER pathway stress due to calcium overload ( thapsigargin) or following prolonged treatment with phorbol esters or Trichostatin A, an inhibitor of class I / II HDACs.

Nevertheless, BCR - crosslinking of PKD1 / 3 - / - cells was sufficient to induce the activation of a number of signalling cascades, similar to that observed in wild - type cells ( Fig. 3B).	"PKD1	36	40	Protein"	"3	43	44	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PKD1"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""3"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore, enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple cellular proteins as well as an increase in intracellular calcium levels was also observed following BCR stimulation of PKD1 / 3 - null B cells ( data not shown).	"PKD1	179	183	Protein"	"3	186	187	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PKD1"", ""start_span"": 179, ""end_span"": 183, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""3"", ""start_span"": 186, ""end_span"": 187, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To search for other potential PKD targets that may show defective regulation in PKD1 / 3 - / - DT40 B cells, we used a PKD substrate phospho - antibody that recognises consensus phosphorylation sequences targeted by PKD enzymes ( LxRxxpS / T) [ 36].	"PKD1	80	84	Protein"	"3	87	88	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PKD1"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""3"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
3C, phorbol ester - and BCR - induced phosphorylation of cellular substrates detected by this phospho - antibody was similar in wild - type and PKD1 / 3 - / - cells and is therefore independent of PKD enzymes.	"PKD1	144	148	Protein"	"3	151	152	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PKD1"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""3"", ""start_span"": 151, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, pretreatment of both wild - type and PKD1 / 3 - / - DT40 B cells with GF109203X, a bisindoylmaleimide derivative that inhibits PKCs prevented the induction of proteins that contain phosphorylated LxRxxS / T motifs.

Thus loss of PKD1 / 3 enzymes does not globally disrupt the phosphorylation of cellular proteins that contain LxRxxpS / T motifs.

Furthermore, expression of an activated PKD1 mutant enhances HPK1 - mediated NFkappaB activation [ 38].

The data ( Fig. 4A) show that NFkappaB transcriptional activity was strongly induced in both wild - type and PKD1 / 3 - / - DT40 B cells in response to either phorbol ester or BCR stimulation.

We have previously used these PKD - null DT40 cells to define an essential role for PKDs in regulation of class II HDACs, the present report now describes an indispensable role for PKDs in regulating the phosphorylation of HSP27 on serine 82, a site previously identified as a target for the p38 - MAPKAPK2 signalling cascade [ 42].

These latter findings are in striking contrast to previous observations in HeLa and epithelial cell lines where overexpression / RNAi approaches have implicated PKD1 / 2 in the control of proliferation, survival and NFkappaB activation [ 20, 23].

This inhibitory mechanism was also confirmed in Th2 cells and in T cells of transgenic mice overexpressing GATA - 3 in T cells, which are shown to be deficient in transforming growth factor ( TGF) - beta - mediated FOXP3 induction.

This inhibition is mediated by direct binding of GATA3 to the FOXP3 promoter, which represses its transactivation process.

Recently, it was shown that T - bet directly modulates GATA3 function, suggesting that transcription factors compete in the early differentiation phase of T cells, potentially integrating environmental signals to finally imprint the T cell phenotype [ 4, 5].

A GATA3 - dominated immune response has been shown to be essential in airway hyperresonsiveness [ 6] and IL - 4 - dominated responses can break antigen - specific immune tolerance [ 7].

Overexpression of a dominant negative form of GATA3 [ 8] or treatment with antisense - mediated GATA3 blockade [ 9] decreased the severity of the allergic airway hyper - responsiveness.

These cells express the forkhead transcription factor FOXP3 and constitutively express CD25 on their surface, but they lack expression of Th1 or Th2 cytokines.

TGF - beta has been demonstrated to be important for the persistent induction of these cells in vitro and in vivo, since animals lacking the TGF - betaRII on T cells have fewer peripherally iTreg cells [ 15] and suffer from a T cell - dependent multiorgan inflammatory disease [ 16].

We also show that GATA3 directly binds to the FOXP3 promoter and thereby prevents the induction of this gene, demonstrating that Th2 differentiation overrules iTreg induction.	"GATA3	18	23	Protein"	"FOXP3	46	51	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GATA3"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, it is not known if all CD4 + T cells have the same capacity to express FOXP3.

The inability of Th2 cells to express FOXP3 was also documented at the single - cell level, confirming that Th2 cells lack FOXP3 expression ( Figure 2A).	"FOXP3	38	43	Protein"	"FOXP3	123	128	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Interestingly, we observed that resting iTreg cells express FOXP3 but show low CD25 surface expression.	"FOXP3	60	65	Protein"	"CD25	79	83	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD25"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore TGF - beta - mediated FOXP3 induction failed in these cells in contrast to the naive T cells ( Figure 2B).	"TGF - beta	12	22	Protein"	"FOXP3	34	39	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TGF - beta"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As shown in Figure 3B, the frequency of the IL - 4 + cells was always below 1% in the FOXP3 + cells close to the background.	"IL - 4	44	50	Protein"	"FOXP3	86	91	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 4"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In addition, neither the Th2 clone ( BR8) nor CRTH2 cells significantly expressed FOXP3 ( Figure 3C).	"CRTH2	46	51	Protein"	"FOXP3	82	87	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CRTH2"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Cells enriched for their IL - 4 secretion using the magnetic cell isolation technology contained some FOXP3 - expressing cells, but importantly, the expression did not overlap.	"IL - 4	25	31	Protein"	"FOXP3	102	107	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 4"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
FOXP3 and GATA3 Kinetics in Differentiating Cells	"FOXP3	0	5	Protein"	"GATA3	10	15	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GATA3"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
After initiation of the differentiation process, FOXP3 and GATA3 showed a similar expression kinetic within the first 3 d, which are considered to be critical in T cell commitment [ 18].	"FOXP3	49	54	Protein"	"GATA3	59	64	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GATA3"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, although GATA3 and FOXP3 showed similar kinetics, their expression polarizes at the end of the differentiation process when cells were cultured towards Th2 or iTreg cells, respectively ( Figure 4A and 4B).	"GATA3	15	20	Protein"	"FOXP3	25	30	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GATA3"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Interestingly, the Th0 cells were expressing more FOXP3 than the Th2 cells, but expressed low levels of GATA3; however, the protein expression slightly differed from mRNA expression, suggesting also posttranslational regulation and degradation as potential additional mechanisms in the differentiation process.	"FOXP3	50	55	Protein"	"GATA3	104	109	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GATA3"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
On the single - cell level, it can be seen that cells progress through a transition phase, where GATA3 and FOXP3 expression coexist to some degree in the same cells, which is resolved in iTreg cells after 7 d ( Figure 4B).	"GATA3	97	102	Protein"	"FOXP3	107	112	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GATA3"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
IL - 4 Inhibits TGF - beta - Mediated iTreg Commitment	"IL - 4	0	6	Protein"	"TGF - beta	16	26	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 4"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 6, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TGF - beta"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Low levels of GATA3 were induced also in the absence of IL - 4, as it was previously observed [ 3].	"GATA3	14	19	Protein"	"IL - 4	56	62	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GATA3"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 4"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, at low concentration, IL - 4 was able to marginally induce FOXP3 expression.	"IL - 4	31	37	Protein"	"FOXP3	68	73	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 4"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In already - existing Treg cells, IL - 4 failed to inhibit FOXP3 expression ( Figure S3A), and the suppressive capacity was not altered ( Figure S3C).	"IL - 4	34	40	Protein"	"FOXP3	59	64	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 4"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Similarly pre - existing iTreg cells did not decrease FOXP3 expression upon IL - 4 exposure ( Figure S3B).	"FOXP3	54	59	Protein"	"IL - 4	76	82	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 4"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The addition of IL - 4 to iTreg - driving conditions decreased the number of FOXP3 + cells ( Figure 6B).

In line with the previous findings, the IL - 4 - producing cells and the FOXP3 expressing cells are nonoverlapping populations.	"IL - 4	40	46	Protein"	"FOXP3	73	78	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 4"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

TAT - GATA3 was successfully transduced in a homogeneous and dose - dependent manner into human CD4 + T cells ( Figure 7A, upper panel).

As described for the human cells, TGF - beta dramatically up - regulated Foxp3 in the DO11. 10 littermate control mice.

Taken together, these results demonstrated a repressive role of IL - 4 - induced GATA3 transcription factor in the generation of iTreg cells.

GATA3 Represses the FOXP3 Promoter	"GATA3	0	5	Protein"	"FOXP3	20	25	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GATA3"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Overexpression of GATA3 in naive T cells diminished luciferase activity of the FOXP3 promoter compared with the control vector ( Figure 8B).	"GATA3	18	23	Protein"	"FOXP3	79	84	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GATA3"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore GATA3 binds directly to the FOXP3 promoter as investigated by pull - down assay.	"GATA3	12	17	Protein"	"FOXP3	40	45	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GATA3"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
HEK cells were transiently transfected with GATA3 or a control vector, and increasing amounts of lysates were incubated with oligonucleotides containing the GATA3 site of the FOXP3 promoter or a control oligonucleotide with a mutated GATA3 - binding site.	"GATA3	44	49	Protein"	"FOXP3	175	180	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GATA3"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 180, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Only HEK cells overexpressing GATA3 and Th2 cells showed GATA3 - binding activity ( Figure 8D and 8E).	"GATA3	30	35	Protein"	"GATA3	57	62	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GATA3"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GATA3"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These experiments demonstrated that GATA3 binds the palindromic FOXP3 promoter.	"GATA3	36	41	Protein"	"FOXP3	64	69	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GATA3"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The current study reveals that FOXP3 induction, an important step in iTreg commitment, is inhibited by GATA3, which is the key regulator for polarization toward Th2 cells.	"FOXP3	31	36	Protein"	"GATA3	103	108	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GATA3"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore GATA3 not only induces differentiation into Th2 cells but also inhibits FOXP3 expression and commitment into iTreg cells.	"GATA3	10	15	Protein"	"FOXP3	82	87	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GATA3"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
IL - 4 has already been shown to negatively regulate the development of naive T cells into Th1 or the IL - 17 - producing T cells ( Th17) [ 46, 47].	"IL - 4	0	6	Protein"	"IL - 17	102	109	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 4"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 6, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 17"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Similar effects have been recently described for IL - 6, which, combined with TGF - beta, inhibits the generation of iTreg cells and induces differentiation into the Th17 cells by an unknown mechanism [ 48, 49].	"IL - 6	49	55	Protein"	"TGF - beta	78	88	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 6"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TGF - beta"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus the polarization into iTreg cells is negatively regulated by the effector cytokines IL - 4 and IL - 6.	"IL - 4	89	95	Protein"	"IL - 6	100	106	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 4"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 6"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
IL - 4 may favor proliferation of nTreg cells [ 47] or directly regulate FOXP3 expression in a STAT - dependent fashion [ 51].	"IL - 4	0	6	Protein"	"FOXP3	73	78	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 4"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 6, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This result suggested a competitive mechanism between GATA3 and FOXP3 transcription factors in determining lineage commitment during the early phase of differentiation.	"GATA3	54	59	Protein"	"FOXP3	64	69	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GATA3"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Accordingly, we investigated naturally high GATA3 - expressing cells and confirmed the absence of FOXP3.	"GATA3	44	49	Protein"	"FOXP3	98	103	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GATA3"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Protein transduction of GATA3 into naive T cells inhibited FOXP3 induction in human, differentiating, naive T cells.	"GATA3	24	29	Protein"	"FOXP3	59	64	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GATA3"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Site - specific mutation of this site increased the activity of the promoter constructs, thus revealing the repressive nature of this GATA element in memory T cells, which naturally express GATA3, whereas no difference was seen in naive T cells, which do not express GATA3.	"GATA3	190	195	Protein"	"GATA3	267	272	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GATA3"", ""start_span"": 190, ""end_span"": 195, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GATA3"", ""start_span"": 267, ""end_span"": 272, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore keeping GATA3 expression low might be required to induce efficient FOXP3 + iTreg cell generation.	"GATA3	18	23	Protein"	"FOXP3	77	82	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GATA3"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In summary, we demonstrated that FOXP3 is negatively regulated by cytokines such as IL - 4.

We therefore describe a new mechanism of how Il - 4 avoids tolerance induction by repressing FOXP3 expression.

In addition, fluticasone induces the expression of mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK) phosphatase - 1 ( MKP - 1), the endogenous inhibitor of p38 MAPK, which is necessary for GATA - 3 nuclear translocation.

Inflammation in allergic diseases such as asthma, rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis is mediated via expression of the cytokines interleukin ( IL) - 4, IL - 5, and IL - 13 from T helper - 2 ( Th2) cells.

Furthermore, conditional knock - out of the Gata3 gene in mice reduces expression of Th2 cytokines in vitro and in vivo [ 10], and similar results have been reported in isolated murine CD4 + lymphocytes [ 11].

Corticosteroids mediate their anti - inflammatory effects through binding to glucocorticoid receptors ( GRs), which then translocate to the nucleus where they interact with glucocorticoid response elements ( GREs) in the promoter regions of steroid - sensitive genes.

Alternatively, activated GR interacts with coactivator molecules to suppress the expression of inflammatory genes by inhibiting the action of proinflammatory transcription factors such as nuclear factor - kappaB ( NF - kappaB) through the recruitment of co - repressor molecules such as histone deacetylase - 2 [ 17], [ 18].

NL1 can be mutated, and the resulting GR still translocates to the nucleus in response to ligands, but via interaction with importin 7, an event that requires an as - yet unknown component [ 23].

The authors postulated that local recruitment of GR may alter the ability of GATA - 3 either to bind to its target site, to cause transcriptional up - regulation, or to maintain an environment that is permissive for transcription.

Similarly, GATA - 3 was isolated from nonstimulated HuT - 78 cells or cells stimulated for 30 min with anti - CD3 / CD28 and GR was isolated from FP ( 10 - 8 M, 30 min) stimulated HuT - 78 cells.

The potent topical corticosteroid FP caused sustained loss of nuclear GATA - 3 expression and cytoplasmic retention of GATA - 3 at concentrations ranging from 10 - 12 to 10 - 8 M, which cover the therapeutic range [ 37].

We confirmed and extended previous data [ 20] to show that ligand - activated GR as well as GATA - 3 uses importin - alpha for its nuclear import ( Figure 2A and 2B).

In addition, using GFP - labelled GATA - 3 and confocal microscopy we demonstrated that GATA - 3 nuclear import following anti - CD3 / CD28 stimulation for 30 min was attenuated by pretreatment with FP ( 10 - 8 M) ( Figure 2D).	"GFP - labelled GATA - 3	19	42	Protein"	"GATA - 3	88	96	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GFP - labelled GATA - 3"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GATA - 3"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Dexamethasone inhibits p38 MAPK function in a cell type - specific manner through the rapid induction of the dual kinase phosphatase MKP - 1 ( MAPK phosphatase - 1), and this effect lasts for up to 24 h [ 28].

However, the effects of FP on GATA - 3 nuclear import, importin - alpha association and IL - 4 mRNA expression are seen at 10, 000 - fold lower concentrations ( 10 - 12 M, see Figure 2).	"GATA - 3	30	38	Protein"	"IL - 4	88	94	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GATA - 3"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 4"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This effect is not mutual, since activated GATA - 3 did not block GR - importin - alpha association ( Figure 4C).	"GATA - 3	43	51	Protein"	"GR	66	68	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GATA - 3"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GR"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Finally, the effect of FP on GATA - 3 nuclear import was not nonspecific, since FP ( 10 - 8 M) had no effect on p65 nuclear translocation measured at 60 min ( Figure 5D).	"GATA - 3	29	37	Protein"	"p65	112	115	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GATA - 3"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Treatment with inhaled FP ( 500 microg) for 2 h significantly increased GR nuclear translocation ( Figure 7A) and concomitantly decreased the number of nuclear GATA - 3 immunoreactive peripheral blood T cells ( 37% + / - 4. 2% versus 58. 2% + / - 4. 95%, p = 0. 016, W = 28. 0, Wilcoxon ' s rank test) compared with placebo as measured by immunocytochemistry ( Figure 7A and 7B).	"GR	72	74	Protein"	"GATA - 3	160	168	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GR"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GATA - 3"", ""start_span"": 160, ""end_span"": 168, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, inhaled FP ( 500 microg) induced significant loss in nuclear GATA - 3 at 2 h ( median [ 95% CI], 0. 40 [ 0. 27 - 0. 53] versus 0. 14 [ 0. 11 - 0. 19], p < 0. 05, W = 21. 00, Wilcoxon ' s rank test) ( Figure 7C) and cytoplasmic GATA - 3 levels were enhanced by inhaled FP in a dose - dependent manner ( median [ 95% CI], 0. 0032 [ 0. 0026 - 0. 0039] versus 0. 658 [ 0. 592 - 0. 720], p < 0. 05, W = - 21. 00, Wilcoxon ' s rank test) ( Figure 7D).

Taken together, our data suggest that inhaled FP reduces nuclear localization of GATA - 3 in vivo by acutely inhibiting phospho - GATA - 3 - importin association.	"GATA - 3	81	89	Protein"	"GATA - 3	130	138	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GATA - 3"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GATA - 3"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This effect may be direct, through competition for importin - alpha or associated molecules, or secondary to an effect on p38 MAPK - mediated GATA - 3 phosphorylation via rapid induction of MKP - 1.	"GATA - 3	142	150	Protein"	"MKP - 1	190	197	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GATA - 3"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""MKP - 1"", ""start_span"": 190, ""end_span"": 197, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Secondly, corticosteroids at higher concentrations increase the expression of MKP - 1, a potent inhibitor of p38 MAPK activity and thereby prevent T cell receptor / co - receptor activation of p38 MAPK to prevent the phosphorylation of GATA - 3 that is necessary for interaction with importin - alpha and subsequent nuclear import.	"MKP - 1	78	85	Protein"	"GATA - 3	236	244	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MKP - 1"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GATA - 3"", ""start_span"": 236, ""end_span"": 244, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We have previously shown that translocation of GATA - 3 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus involves the nuclear transporter protein importin - alpha, which interacts with phosphorylated GATA - 3 [ 12].	"GATA - 3	47	55	Protein"	"GATA - 3	185	193	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GATA - 3"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GATA - 3"", ""start_span"": 185, ""end_span"": 193, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We now confirm, in human T cells, that GR also uses the same nuclear import mechanism as GATA - 3 [ 22].	"GR	39	41	Protein"	"GATA - 3	89	97	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GR"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GATA - 3"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We therefore propose that there is competition between ligand - activated GR and phospho - GATA - 3 for nuclear import.	"GR	74	76	Protein"	"GATA - 3	91	99	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GR"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GATA - 3"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore, there was some degree of specificity for GATA - 3, as nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF - kappaB was not affected by corticosteroid exposure.	"GATA - 3	54	62	Protein"	"p65	96	99	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GATA - 3"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The evidence from the in vitro competition assays does, however, suggest that purified activated GR can clearly attenuate purified phospho - GATA - 3 - importin - alpha association and that the converse does not occur.	"GR	97	99	Protein"	"GATA - 3	141	149	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GR"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GATA - 3"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This acute mechanism may also contribute to the reduction in GATA - 3 nuclear import and may play a major role at low corticosteroid concentrations and / or at early time points prior to MKP - 1 induction.

Although we did not assess the acute inhibitory effect of FP on the expression of IL - 4 mRNA in vivo, a single inhalation of FP ( 500 microg) may have comparable effects, as it provides plasma levels within a relevant range of concentrations used to suppress IL - 4 transcription in our in vitro system [ 37].

Both forms of dCGN clearly stimulated expression of ICAM - 1 ( CD54) on PBM and THP - 1 cells ( Fig. 4A).

Another surface antigen, the lymphocyte function - associated antigen 3 ( CD58) was slightly reduced on PBM after treatment with 40 kDa dCGN ( Fig. 4B).

Interestingly, expression of major histocompatibility complex molecules of class I ( HLA - ABC) and of class II ( HLA - DR), as well as the monocyte marker CD14, seemed to be reduced by treatment with dCGN ( Fig. 4B).

The increase in surface ICAM - 1 expression and TNF - alpha production by monocytes correlated with an upregulation of mRNA for these molecules.

Both forms ( 10 or 40 kDa) of dCGN induced activation of the p50 and p65 subunits of NF - kappaB.

Again, both forms ( 10 or 40 kDa) of dCGN induced an increase of the p50 and p65 subunits of NF - kappaB in the nucleus of these cells.

In addition, degradation of the inhibitor IkappaBalpha was also observed in cells treated with dCGN ( Fig. 7B).

No significant IkappaBalpha degradation was detected within two hours of dCGN treatment, but IkappaBalpha was markedly degraded by four hours of dCGN treatment ( Fig. 7B).

We focused on IkappaBalpha subunit, since it masks the nuclear localisation sequence of p65, it is the most rapidly degraded subunit and the most studied one.

Since monocyte activation by LPS is associated with the presence of the CD14 and TLR4 receptors [ 38] - [ 40], the different response observed could be due to the different expression of these receptors in PBM and THP - 1 cells.

TLR4 has been recently identified as a surface membrane receptor for CGN in human colonic epithelial cells [ 41].

Another indicator that dCGN stimulate monocytes leading to a more active phenotype is the fact that surface expression of the adhesion molecule ICAM - 1 was enhanced in both PBM and THP - 1 cells.

Thus, degraded CGN clearly can activate monocytes to express an increased number of ICAM - 1 adhesion molecules, therefore being capable of creating the conditions characteristic of Crohn ' s disease symptomatology, i. e. PBM accumulation and MGC formation [ 45], [ 46].

Monocytes exposed to dCGN acquired an inflammatory phenotype that included higher expression of the adhesion molecule ICAM - 1 and TNF - alpha production, via the NF - kappaB pathway.

Nuclei isolated from THP - 1 cells were fluorescence - stained for NF - kappaB p50 subunit or NF - kappaB p65 subunit before ( filled area) or after cells were treated with 1 mg / ml of 10 kDa dCGN ( C10), or with 1 mg / ml of 40 kDa dCGN ( C40) for 30 minutes at 37degreesC.

A spontaneous mutation of the X - linkedFoxp3gene inscurfymice causes an autoimmune - like disease, whereas the mutation in humans leads to immunodysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, and X - linked syndrome that is also a severe multiorgan autoimmune disease with hyper - IgE ( Ziegler, 2006). Although the essential role of Foxp3 in central and peripheral tolerance has been extensively studied, its regulation, cooperation with other transcription factors, and how it functions in inducible T reg ( iT reg) cells to suppress various target genes is mostly not yet understood.

Although natural T reg ( nT reg) cells that differentiate in the thymus are characterized by their stable Foxp3 expression, the generation of iT reg cells specific for allergens, alloantigens, and autoantigens in the periphery has been associated with a transient Foxp3 + phenotype ( Fontenot et al., 2003; Hori et al., 2003).

RUNX1 plays an important role in hematopoiesis during development, and RUNX3 has important functions in thymogenesis and neurogenesis ( Wang et al., 1996; Inoue et al., 2002; Levanon et al., 2002).

RUNX proteins heterodimerize with the non - DNA - binding partner, CBFbeta, which increases the affinity for DNA binding and stabilizes the complex by preventing ubiquitin - dependent degradation ( Wang et al., 1993).

To investigate the role of RUNX transcription factors in the development of iT reg cells, we cultured naive CD4 + T cells, isolated from human PBMCs, in conditions that enable the development of iT reg cells.

This result suggested further experiments to investigate whether the up - regulation of RUNX1 and RUNX3 might be a feature of iT reg cells during their development or even a prerequisite for their induction.

After the pull - down with oligonucleotides containing the wild - type binding sequences, but not mutant sequences, RUNX binding to the FOXP3 promoter oligonucleotides was detected by Western blot ( Fig. 3 A).

Nevertheless, the RPS3 - importin - alpha association was not augmented ( Fig. 3c), nor was significant nuclear RPS3 detected ( Fig. 3d).

We further examined whether a subsequent NF - kappaB activation signal independently promotes the importin - alpha association and nuclear transport of RPS3 after IkappaBalpha degradation.

Thus, IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and degradation itself is required but not sufficient to cause RPS3 association with importin - alpha followed by nuclear translocation.

Rather, an additional signal, potentially IKKbeta phosphorylation of RPS3, is required.

We therefore hypothesized that IKKbeta could directly phosphorylate RPS3.	"IKKbeta	31	38	Protein"	"RPS3	68	72	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IKKbeta"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RPS3"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The results indicated that IKKbeta phosphorylated S209, located in the RPS3 C - terminus ( Fig. 4b).

Compared with the wild - type protein, the S209A mutation reduced IKKbeta - mediated RPS3 phosphorylation ( Fig. 4c).

Thus, RPS3 S209 phosphorylation was due to the alternate specificity of the IKKbeta kinase rather than any trace amount of CK2 bound to IKKs.

We next generated a phospho - S209 RPS3 antibody and confirmed that endogenous RPS3 was phosphorylated at S209 in a time - dependent manner upon TNF stimulation ( Fig. 4e).

We also tested the impact of activating NF - kappaB by overexpressing IKKbeta on RPS3 nuclear translocation.

We also found that RPS3 knockdown reduced TNF - induced expression of an Ig kappaB - driven luciferase construct6 ( Fig. 5d).

We next used chromatin immunoprecipitation to determine whether S209 phosphorylation affects RPS3 and p65 recruitment to specific kappaB sites in intact chromatin during NF - kappaB activation.

Thus, the recruitment of RPS3 as well as the contingent recruitment of p65 to key promoters depended on S209.

However, cell surface CD25 expression was comparable between the wild - type and S209A RPS3 transfected cells ( Supplementary Fig. 11).

As expected, transfecting increasing amounts of NleH1 - HA plasmid blocked TNFalpha - induced NF - kappaB activation in a dose - dependent manner ( Fig. 6a - b) 9.

In uninfected cells, TNF - treatment stimulated a ~ 7 - fold increase in RPS3 S209 phosphorylation, peaking at 30 minutes ( Fig. 6d).

The parallel between RPS3 phosphorylation and its nuclear translocation during E. coli infection provides evidence in the context of an NF - kappaB - dependent disease process that RPS3 S209 phosphorylation is important for nuclear translocation.

Indeed, these genes were only modestly upregulated in cells infected with wild - type E. coli O157: H7, but significantly induced in cells infected with either deltanleH1 or deltaescN strains ( Fig. 6e).

These data demonstrate that NleH1 inhibits RPS3 S209 phosphorylation both in vitro and in vivo, which might benefit the bacterium in colonization and transmission.

Wild - type NleH1 expression significantly reduced TNF - induced RPS3 S209 phosphorylation, whereas the K159A mutant failed to do so ( Fig. 7b).

Collectively, these results demonstrate that NleH1 kinase activity is required to block RPS3 S209 phosphorylation.

As expected, E. coli infections did not affect the RPS3 nuclear translocation in IKKbeta ( SSAA) - expressing cells, where NF - kappaB signaling was low ( Fig. 7d).

Our data now show that NleH1 selectively inhibits RPS3 phosphorylation, thus retarding its nuclear translocation and subsequent NF - kappaB function, without altering other NF - kappaB signaling.

Many bacteria pathogens have products that target key kinases to inactivate them in host cells, whereas E. coli O157: H7 employed NleH1 to steer the substrate specificity of IKKbeta thus specifically fine - tuning host NF - kappaB signaling.

Degradation of IkappaB - alpha was progressively induced at 5 - 30 min, followed by de novo synthesis at 60 min with full replenishment at 240 min in both Tat - positive and negative cells ( Figure 2B, cytosol).

These results indicated that Tat enhanced the NF - kappaB activity in un - stimulated and PMA - stimulated cells without affecting the IKK activity and IkappaB - alpha content.

These results indicated that the arginine - rich domain of Tat was involved in the binding to IkappaB - alpha, which was consistent with previous observations ( 50, 51).

The p65 protein was coimmunoprecipitated with wild - type Tat or the mutants Tat T, N ( 23, 24) A, Tat K ( 50, 51) A and Tat R ( 49 - 57) A at similar levels, while a significant decrease in coimmunoprecipitation was observed for Tat C ( 22, 25, 27) A ( Figure 4A).

MIP - 1alpha, which was the mostly activated gene by Tat, encodes for a chemokine that promotes the recruitment of pro - inflammatory cells ( 56).

Cells were transfected with siRNA Tat, siRNA control or left untransfected to modulate the Tat expression, and then analysed for the kinetic of NF - kappaB activation following viral infection.

Upon HIV - 1 infection, the early NF - kappaB activation occurred concomitantly with IKK activation and IkappaB - alpha degradation in the absence of Tat.

These findings indicate that in single round HIV - 1 infection, Tat enhanced the NF - kappaB activity without affecting the IKK activity and the half - life of IkappaB - alpha.

We also demonstrated that the Tat cysteine - rich sequence ( C22, 25, 27) was involved in the binding to the RHD of p65 and NF - kappaB activation.

By ChIP analysis, we observed that Tat increased the recruitment of p65 to the NF - kappaB enhancers of the activated genes, and was recovered at the same sites.

Thus, in the set of distinct NF - kappaB - responsive genes, Tat acted as a component of the transcriptional initiation complex, which is consistent with previous reports on Tat promoting the transcription via DNA motifs ( 72, 73).

IL - 1beta levels in cell culture supernatants were not greatly increased in either the CF or control cell lines ( Fig. 2a - d), although a small increase in IL - 1beta production was detected in NuLi - 1 and CuFi - 1 cells, but not in S9 and IB3 - 1 cells, by 24 hours.

Stimulation of PBMCs with P. aeruginosa that lacks exsA ( PAO1deltaexsA), a key regulator of type III secretion, produced three - fold less IL - 1beta compared to the parental PAO1 strain by 24 hours ( Fig. 5a).

Contrary to our hypothesis, these results indicate that PBMCs from CF patients do not display increased production of IL - 1beta or IL - 8 with inflammasome activation nor do they suggest any increased basal or induced NF - kappaB activity.

This confirmed that NF - kappaB activation alone is not sufficient for maximal IL - 1beta secretion, but increased priming of NF - kappaB is capable of augmenting IL - 1beta production and secretion upon inflammasome stimulation.

Dependency of these responses on NF - kappaB was confirmed by pharmacologic inhibition of NF - kappaB using the Bay11 - 7082 inhibitor of IkappaBalpha phosphorylation, which significantly reduced NF - kappaB / AP - 1 activation ( P < 0. 001) ( Fig. 6d) and the subsequent production of IL - 8 ( P < 0. 01) ( Fig. 6e) and IL - 1beta ( P < 0. 001) ( Fig. 6f) in response to both heat - killed and live PAO1.

Overall these results confirm that NF - kappaB is an important modulator of IL - 1beta production and that increased activation of NF - kappaB augments inflammasome - mediated production of IL - 1beta.

Despite our findings indicating that bronchial epithelial cells when grown in vitro are unlikely to be significantly involved in the direct production of IL - 1beta ( Fig. 2a - d), others have shown their capacity to respond to alveolar macrophage - derived IL - 1beta and to amplify the inflammatory response through the induction of chemokines and recruitment of inflammatory effector cells [ 42].

Although we hypothesized that CF cells would secrete increased amounts of IL - 1beta, we found that IL - 1beta production in CF PBMCs was not increased upon inflammasome stimulation as compared to controls ( Fig. 5a - b).

However, as monocytes and other PBMCs express CFTR [ 50], [ 51] and produce large amounts of IL - 1beta, they are adequate models to examine the effects of CFTR function on IL - 1beta production.

In contrast, deletion of IKKbeta, a kinase essential in NF - kappaB activation, increases IL - 1beta secretion in murine macrophages [ 56], [ 57] and demonstrates a dual role for NF - kappaB in regulation of IL - 1beta.
