The B cells were found to express BMP type I and type II receptors and BMP - 6 rapidly induced phosphorylation of Smad1 / 5 / 8.

Furthermore, BMP - 2, - 4, 6 and - 7 had an antiproliferative and a proapoptotic effect on multiple myeloma cells [ 9 - 11].

This analysis revealed that the type I receptors Act - RIA, BMP - RIB and the type II receptors BMP - RII and Act - RIIb are expressed on resting human B - cells ( Figure 4).

BMP - 6 induces phosphorylation of Smad1 / 5 / 8	"BMP - 6	0	7	Protein"	"Smad1	35	40	Protein"	"5	43	44	Protein"	"8	47	48	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Smad1"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""5"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""8"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Next, we wanted to explore whether the BMP - 6 induced phosphorylation of Smad 1 / 5 / 8 also could induce transcriptional changes of target genes.	"BMP - 6	39	46	Protein"	"Smad 1	74	80	Protein"	"5	83	84	Protein"	"8	87	88	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Smad 1"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""5"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""8"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Taken together, these data suggest that Id1 could be a possible target gene for mediating the effects of BMP - 6 in human B cells, whereas Id2 and Id3 not seem to be involved.	"Id1	40	43	Protein"	"BMP - 6	105	112	Protein"	"Id2	139	142	Protein"	"Id3	147	150	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Id1"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Id2"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Id3"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Importantly, BMP - 6 induced a rapid and marked increase in Smad - 1 / 5 / 8 phosphorylation.	"BMP - 6	13	20	Protein"	"Smad - 1	60	68	Protein"	"5	71	72	Protein"	"8	75	76	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Smad - 1"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""5"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""8"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore, the BMP - 6 induced Smad phosphorylation was followed by a selective upregulation of Id1 mRNA and subsequent Id1 protein.

Thus, phosphorylation of p38, STAT3 and Smad1 / 5 / 8 represent important BMP - signalling pathways that mediated the effects of BMPs and even cross - talk between these pathways has been reported [ 29, 30].	"STAT3	30	35	Protein"	"Smad1	40	45	Protein"	"5	48	49	Protein"	"8	52	53	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""STAT3"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Smad1"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""5"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""8"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In the present study, real - time RT - PCR experiments revealed a specific four - fold upregulation for Id1 in BMP - 6 - treated B cells, while the amount of Id2 - Id4 remained unchanged.	"Id1	104	107	Protein"	"BMP - 6	111	118	Protein"	"Id2	158	161	Protein"	"Id4	164	167	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Id1"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Id2"", ""start_span"": 158, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Id4"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 167, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In that respect, it is noteworthy that TGF - beta signalling in early and mature B cells induces both Id2 and Id3 expression [ 36, 37], but not Id1 ( data not shown).	"TGF - beta	39	49	Protein"	"Id2	102	105	Protein"	"Id3	110	113	Protein"	"Id1	144	147	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TGF - beta"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Id2"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Id3"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Id1"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 147, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Quantification of Id1, Id2 and Id3 protein was calculated by normalizing the specific protein bands to beta - actin using Image Quant 5. 5 software ( Molecular Dynamics).

To measure mRNA expression of BMP6, Id1 - Id4 and PGK1 PCR were carried out with TaqMan ( R) universal master mix.

Human APOBEC3G ( A3G), the most prominent member of the APOBEC3 family has been identified as the cellular restriction factor that is responsible for inhibition of virion infectivity factor ( Vif) - deleted human immunodeficiency virus - 1 ( HIV - 1) replication in non - permissive cells ( 4).

Sp1 and Sp3 proteins were detected using alpha - Sp1 ( Pep2) antibody ( sc - 59, Santa Cruz) or alpha - Sp3 ( D - 20) antibody ( sc - 644, Santa Cruz) followed by incubation with alpha - rabbit - HRP ( Amersham Biosciences).

In line with these publications, we observed an induction of the A3G promoter by approximately 2 - fold after IFN - alpha or IFN - gamma stimulation ( Figure 4D) with IFN - gamma being slightly more potent.	"A3G	65	68	Protein"	"IFN - alpha	110	121	Protein"	"IFN - gamma	125	136	Protein"	"IFN - gamma	167	178	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""A3G"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IFN - alpha"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IFN - gamma"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IFN - gamma"", ""start_span"": 167, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Sp1 and Sp3 antibodies, but not an actin antibody, immunoprecipitated the A3G promoter in A3. 01 T cells ( Figure 6C, upper panel).	"Sp1	0	3	Protein"	"Sp3	8	11	Protein"	"actin	35	40	Protein"	"A3G	74	77	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sp1"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Sp3"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""actin"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""A3G"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Functionality of the siRNAs directed against Sp1 or Sp3 was confirmed by western blot analysis: protein levels of Sp1 as well as the long and short isoforms of Sp3 were strongly reduced in the presence of 150 or 300 ng specific siRNA ( Figure 7A).	"Sp1	45	48	Protein"	"Sp3	52	55	Protein"	"Sp1	114	117	Protein"	"Sp3	160	163	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sp1"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Sp3"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Sp1"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Sp3"", ""start_span"": 160, ""end_span"": 163, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Luciferase assays revealed that A3G promoter activities remained unchanged ( data not shown), most probably due to the high basal expression level of the endogenous Sp1 and / or Sp3 proteins.	"Luciferase	0	10	Protein"	"A3G	32	35	Protein"	"Sp1	165	168	Protein"	"Sp3	178	181	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Luciferase"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""A3G"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Sp1"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 168, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Sp3"", ""start_span"": 178, ""end_span"": 181, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
EMSA was performed with a 1 - or 30 - fold molar excess of unlabeled APO - Sp1 / 3 probe ( competitor, lanes 6 and 7) or APO - Sp1 / 3mut probe ( competitor mut., lanes 12 and 13).

The generation, culture and activation of PKD1 - / -, PKD3 - / - and PKD1 / 3 - / - knockout DT40 B cell lines have been described previously [ 1].	"PKD1	42	46	Protein"	"PKD3	54	58	Protein"	"PKD1	69	73	Protein"	"3	76	77	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PKD1"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PKD3"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PKD1"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""3"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
DT40 B cells express two PKD isoforms, PKD1 and PKD3, and as previously described we have recently generated DT40 B cell lines that lack expression of either PKD1 or PKD3 or both enzymes [ 1].	"PKD1	39	43	Protein"	"PKD3	48	52	Protein"	"PKD1	158	162	Protein"	"PKD3	166	170	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PKD1"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PKD3"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PKD1"", ""start_span"": 158, ""end_span"": 162, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PKD3"", ""start_span"": 166, ""end_span"": 170, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Hence, in the presence of doxycycline, Flag - PKD3 expression in PKD1 / 3 double knockout cells is comparable to endogenous PKD3 present in wild - type DT40 cells and removal of doxycycline from the culture media for 5 days results in a completely null PKD phenotype ( Fig. 1A).	"PKD3	46	50	Protein"	"PKD1	65	69	Protein"	"3	72	73	Protein"	"PKD3	124	128	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PKD3"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PKD1"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""3"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PKD3"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The small heat shock protein HSP27 has recently been proposed as a PKD1 substrate [ 24] and we accordingly assessed whether PKD - null DT40 cells have defective phosphorylation of HSP27 on serine 82, the proposed PKD1 substrate sequence.	"HSP27	29	34	Protein"	"PKD1	67	71	Protein"	"HSP27	180	185	Protein"	"PKD1	213	217	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""HSP27"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PKD1"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""HSP27"", ""start_span"": 180, ""end_span"": 185, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PKD1"", ""start_span"": 213, ""end_span"": 217, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Hence, PKD3 as well as PKD1 can regulate HSP27 phosphorylation and in DT40 B cells they are functionally redundant as HSP27 kinases.

We did observe that the strength of BCR ( but not phorbol ester) - induced regulation of the Erk1 - RSK1 signalling pathway was reduced in PKD1 / 3 - / - B cells compared to wild - type B cells ( Fig. 3B).

Specifically interleukin 4 ( IL - 4) - induced STAT6 and GATA3 inhibit differentiation into Th1 cells in the early phase of commitment [ 1, 2].

GATA3 is sufficient to induce a Th2 phenotype [ 3] and acts not only through the induction of IL - 4, IL - 5 and IL - 13, the Th2 cytokines, but also through the inhibition of Th1 cell - specific factors [ 3].	"GATA3	0	5	Protein"	"IL - 4	94	100	Protein"	"IL - 5	102	108	Protein"	"IL - 13	113	120	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GATA3"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 4"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 5"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 13"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The current study provides evidence that GATA3 and FOXP3 play a competitive role in iTreg cell commitment as T - bet and GATA3 for Th1 and Th2 differentiation, respectively.

Naturally occurring Th2 cells such as CRTH2 + T cells, T cells isolated according to their IL - 4 secretion, or an IL - 4 - producing T cell clone ( BR8) were also lacking FOXP3 expression ( Figure 2B).

Because IL - 4 is the key Th2 cytokine, the expression of IL - 4 and FOXP3 in freshly isolated CD4 + T cells was analyzed by fluorescence activated cell sorting ( FACS).

IL - 4 - expressing cells were most abundant among CD45RO + CD25 - cells, which did not co - express FOXP3 ( Figure 3A, left panel).

In contrast, CD45RO + CD25 + cells abundantly expressed FOXP3, while lacking IL - 4 ( Figure 3A, right panel).

To study the effects of IL - 4 on already - existing human natural or inducible Treg cells, we exposed sorted CD25 + T cells ( nTreg cells) to IL - 4 and analyzed FOXP3 expression and suppressive capacity.	"IL - 4	24	30	Protein"	"CD25	110	114	Protein"	"IL - 4	143	149	Protein"	"FOXP3	163	168	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 4"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD25"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 4"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 163, ""end_span"": 168, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
CD25 was down - regulated in TGF - beta - treated cells compare to activated T cells, which was even more pronounced in cells cultured with TGF - beta and IL - 4.	"CD25	0	4	Protein"	"TGF - beta	29	39	Protein"	"TGF - beta	140	150	Protein"	"IL - 4	155	161	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CD25"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TGF - beta"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TGF - beta"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 4"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These results showed that IL - 4 acts in vitro as an inhibitor of FOXP3 expression, without interfering with TGF - beta signaling, probably acting at the level of transcription factors, and possibly by a GATA3 - dependent mechanism.

FOXP3 expression decreased once GATA3 expression is high; therefore, we hypothesized a potential role for GATA3 in repressing FOXP3.

Besides GATA3 ' s well - known positive effect on gene regulation, GATA3 ' s repressive capabilities were previously shown to restrict Th1 commitment by inhibiting STAT4 expression [ 2, 21], and therefore GATA3 prevents differentiation into Th1 cells.

TAT - GATA3 reduced FOXP3 expression in a dose - dependent manner, whereas a DNA - binding domain truncated version ( TAT - deltaDBD - GATA3) did not affect FOXP3 expression as compared with expression in untransduced cells ( Figure 7A).

In contrast, cells from the CD2 - GATA3xDO11. 10 mice showed dramatically reduced Foxp3 expression when activated with TGF - beta and OVA ( Figure 7B).

To investigate the molecular mechanism of GATA3 - mediated repression of human FOXP3, the human FOXP3 promoter was studied and a palindromic binding site for GATA3 was discovered.	"GATA3	42	47	Protein"	"FOXP3	79	84	Protein"	"FOXP3	96	101	Protein"	"GATA3	158	163	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GATA3"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GATA3"", ""start_span"": 158, ""end_span"": 163, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In this competitive process TGF - beta appeared to be mandatory for the induction of FOXP3, possibly by keeping the expression of GATA3 and T - bet low [ 37, 38].	"TGF - beta	28	38	Protein"	"FOXP3	85	90	Protein"	"GATA3	130	135	Protein"	"T - bet	140	147	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TGF - beta"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GATA3"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""T - bet"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 147, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The Th2 cytokine IL - 4 but not IL - 13 ( unpublished data) was able to inhibit TGF - beta - mediated FOXP3 induction and therefore prevented conversion into the regulatory phenotype.	"IL - 4	17	23	Protein"	"IL - 13	32	39	Protein"	"TGF - beta	80	90	Protein"	"FOXP3	102	107	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 4"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 13"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TGF - beta"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Only the IL - 4 / IL - 4 mAb complex resulted in a decrease of the amount of natural or inducible Treg ( CD25 + and Foxp3 +) cells 7 d after treatment.	"IL - 4	9	15	Protein"	"IL - 4	18	24	Protein"	"CD25	105	109	Protein"	"Foxp3	116	121	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 4"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 4"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD25"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
But since a distinction of nTreg and iTreg cells is currently not possible, because iTreg cells also transiently express CD25 after activation, we cannot exclude that IL - 4 may also inhibit Foxp3 expression in nTreg cells in vivo or that additional effects may contribute to the observed drop in Foxp3 expression.

IL - 4 has been previously shown to induce the generation of FOXP3 + Treg cells out of CD4 + CD25 - [ 50].

This inhibitory effect of GATA3 was further confirmed in BALB / c transgenic mice, expressing GATA3 in T cells ( DO11. 10: CD2 - GATA3 transgenic mice).

GATA - 3 determines Th2 cell differentiation and selectively activates the promoters of IL - 4, IL - 5, and IL - 13 through chromatin remodelling [ 4] - [ 7].

This effect was concentration - and time - dependent, with a peak effect of 11. 6 - fold at 30 min at a concentration of 10 - 8 M ( Figure 1C) and was associated with marked reductions in anti - CD3 / CD28 - stimulated IL - 4 and IL - 5 mRNA expression ( Figure 1D) and a loss of GATA - 3 binding to the native IL - 5 promoter ( Figure 1E).

These data also suggest that both activated GR and phospho - GATA - 3 can directly associate with importin - alpha ( Figure 4D) and that activated GR attenuates the phospho - GATA - 3 / importin - alpha interaction in a concentration - dependent manner ( Figure 4E).	"GR	44	46	Protein"	"GATA - 3	61	69	Protein"	"GR	147	149	Protein"	"GATA - 3	175	183	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GR"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GATA - 3"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GR"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GATA - 3"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 183, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Firstly, corticosteroid - activated GR appears to compete with activated GATA - 3 for nuclear import via importin - alpha, which is required for the nuclear transport of both GATA - 3 and GR.

We have also previously reported that GATA - 3 knockdown using siRNA results in suppression of anti - CD3 / CD28 - stimulated IL - 4 / IL - 5 mRNA induction, thus implicating an essential role for GATA - 3 in the transcription of these genes [ 12].	"GATA - 3	38	46	Protein"	"IL - 4	126	132	Protein"	"IL - 5	135	141	Protein"	"GATA - 3	197	205	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GATA - 3"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 4"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 5"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GATA - 3"", ""start_span"": 197, ""end_span"": 205, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In summary, our data provide evidence for a novel action of corticosteroids: suppression of allergic inflammation through a rapid inhibitory effect on GATA - 3 nuclear translocation by preferential binding to the shared nuclear import protein importin - alpha and by a second mechanism involving increased synthesis of MKP - 1, which inhibits p38 MAPK, thus preventing the phosphorylation of GATA - 3 that is necessary for nuclear translocation of GATA - 3.

Indeed, dCGN induced NF - kappaB activation as shown by degradation of IkappaBalpha, translocation of p65 and p50 sub - units to the nucleus and by activation of an NF - kappaB - responsive luciferase reporter plasmid.

The biotinylated FOXP3 promoter oligonucleotides were linked to a streptavidin - coated microtiter plate, and bound RUNX1 or RUNX3 was detected by using anti - RUNX antibodies and a peroxidase - labeled secondary antibody.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP) assay results confirmed the binding of RUNX1 and RUNX3 complexes containing CBFbeta to FOXP3 promoter during the differentiation of naive T cells toward T reg cells.

In these experiments, the overexpression of RUNX1 and RUNX3 eliminated the need of TGF - beta for FOXP3 promoter activation and PMA / ionomycin stimulation was sufficient.

To target all Runx proteins that might be involved in the induction of Foxp3, we used mice in which loxP - flanked Cbfb alleles were inactivated in T cells through expression of a CD4 - cre transgene.	"Runx	14	18	Protein"	"Foxp3	71	76	Protein"	"Cbfb	115	119	Protein"	"CD4 - cre	180	189	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Runx"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Cbfb"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD4 - cre"", ""start_span"": 180, ""end_span"": 189, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
There was a consistently lower percentage of CD4 + T cells that had developed Foxp3 expression in the mesenteric lymph node and lamina propria of mice transferred with CbfbF / F CD4 - cre cells compared with control cells ( Fig. 5, B and C).	"CD4	45	48	Protein"	"Foxp3	78	83	Protein"	"CbfbF	168	173	Protein"	"CD4 - cre	178	187	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CbfbF"", ""start_span"": 168, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD4 - cre"", ""start_span"": 178, ""end_span"": 187, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The suppression was significantly reduced when cells from CbfbF / F CD4 - cre mice were used, demonstrating that TGF - beta - induced Runx complexes are important for the suppressive activity of Foxp3 + T reg cells ( Fig. 6 B).

Cells in which RUNX1 and RUNX3 were knocked down showed markedly lower suppressive activity compared with control iT reg cells at a T reg / CD4 + T responder cell ratio of 1: 20, but not when the T reg / CD4 + T responder cell ratio was increased to 1: 5 ( Fig. 6 D).

RUNX3 plays an important role in TGF - beta - mediated growth control in epithelial cells, as loss of RUNX3 leads to decreased sensitivity to TGF - beta and hyperproliferation of the gastric mucosa ( Blyth et al., 2005).	"RUNX3	0	5	Protein"	"TGF - beta	33	43	Protein"	"RUNX3	102	107	Protein"	"TGF - beta	142	152	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RUNX3"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TGF - beta"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RUNX3"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TGF - beta"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Runx3 / Cbfbeta are both required for the activation of the Ifng gene and silencing of the Il4 gene in Th1 cells ( Djuretic et al., 2007; Naoe et al., 2007).	"Runx3	0	5	Protein"	"Cbfbeta	8	15	Protein"	"Ifng	60	64	Protein"	"Il4	91	94	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Runx3"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Cbfbeta"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Ifng"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Il4"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Runx1 and Runx3 deficiencies caused marked reductions in mature thymocytes and T cells of the CD4 + helper and CD8 + cytotoxic T cell lineages.	"Runx1	0	5	Protein"	"Runx3	10	15	Protein"	"CD4	94	97	Protein"	"CD8	111	114	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Runx1"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Runx3"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD8"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore, it was shown that Runx1 activates IL - 2 and IFN - gamma gene expression in conventional CD4 + T cells by binding to their respective promoter.	"Runx1	31	36	Protein"	"IL - 2	47	53	Protein"	"IFN - gamma	58	69	Protein"	"CD4	102	105	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Runx1"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 2"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IFN - gamma"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
RUNX1 interacts physically with Foxp3 protein, and it was demonstrated that this interaction might be responsible for the suppression of IL - 2 and IFN - gamma production and up - regulation of T reg cell - associated molecules ( Ono et al., 2007).	"RUNX1	0	5	Protein"	"Foxp3	32	37	Protein"	"IL - 2	137	143	Protein"	"IFN - gamma	148	159	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RUNX1"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 2"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IFN - gamma"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 159, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The initial induction of RUNX1 and RUNX3 and the subsequent binding of these transcription factors to the Foxp3 promoter that we showed here might explain the relatively late induction of Foxp3 mRNA that peaks 24 - 48 h after stimulation.	"RUNX1	25	30	Protein"	"RUNX3	35	40	Protein"	"Foxp3	106	111	Protein"	"Foxp3	188	193	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RUNX1"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RUNX3"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 188, ""end_span"": 193, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
RUNX1 alone, or together with its interacting partners p300 and CREB - binding protein, may cooperate with the NFAT transcription complex to activate the IL - 2 promoter ( Sakaguchi et al., 2008).

The induction of the transcription factors RUNX1 and RUNX3 by TGF - beta and the subsequent up - regulation of Foxp3 play a role in iT reg cell generation and its suppressive capacity.

We measured the association of RPS3 with importin - alpha in 293T cells overexpressing wild - type IkappaBalpha or an IkappaBalpha mutant ( SSAA) resistant to IKKbeta - induced phosphorylation and degradation.

Moreover, cells treated with sodium pervanadate ( Pv) to induce IkappaBalpha degradation through an IKK - independent mechanism25 - 27 did not show increased association between RPS3 and importin - alpha ( Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 3b) or nuclear accumulation of RPS3, despite complete IkappaBalpha degradation ( Supplementary Fig. 3c).

To determine whether S209 is the critical site at which IKKbeta phosphorylates RPS3 in living cells, we transfected the wild - type or S209A mutant Flag - RPS3 alone, or together with IKKbeta into cells.

To examine the role of S209 phosphorylation of RPS3 to its NF - kappaB function6, 7, 30, we silenced endogenous RPS3 expression using an siRNA that targets the 3 ' untranslated region ( 3 ' UTR) of RPS3 mRNA, followed by complementation with either wild - type or S209A mutant RPS3 via transfection.

In RPS3 knockdown cells, PMA + I stimulated the recruitment of ectopically expressed, Flag - tagged wild - type, but not S209A RPS3 to the kappaB sites of the NFKBIA and IL8 promoters ( Fig. 5e).

However, TNF - induced RPS3 S209 phosphorylation was unimpaired in cells infected with either deltanleH1 or deltaescN ( Fig. 6d).

To examine whether the kinase activity is required for NleH1 to inhibit IKKbeta phosphorlyation of RPS3 on S209, we ectopically expressing either wild - type or K159A NleH1 in 293T cells.

We next examined whether the inhibitory activity of NleH1 is sufficiently robust to impair the strong nuclear translocation of RPS3 trigged by the constitutively - active IKKbeta ( IKKbeta [ SSEE]) ( Fig. 2d).

Taken together, NleH1 blocks the CK2 substrate specificity of IKKbeta thus inhibiting the IKKbeta - mediated RPS3 S209 phosphorylation thus representing a novel strategy by E. coli O157: H7 to alter the host innate immune response.

The recent observation that human IKKbeta displayed CK2 - like phosphorylation specificity29 coincides with our evidence that recombinant IKKbeta, but not IKKalpha, phosphorylated RPS3.

In contrast, NleH1 does not block NF - kappaB p65 nuclear translocation, which suggests that certain p65 - dependent but RPS3 - independent NF - kappaB target genes might thus be beneficial for E. coli O157: H7 to replicate and disseminate in the host.

These results indicated that in single - round HIV - 1 infection the NF - kappaB activation initially correlated with the IKK activation and IkappaB - alpha degradation independently of the presence of Tat, and it was kept elevated in presence of Tat following the decay of the IKK activity and new synthesis of IkappaB - alpha.

These results were consistent with the requirement of both the cysteine - rich and arginine - rich domains of Tat to enhance the NF - kappaB activity, suggesting that the up - regulation of NF - kappaB - responsive genes by Tat might occur through physical interaction of the viral protein with p65 and IkappaB - alpha.

TNF - alpha activated the expression of MIP - 1alpha and induced the p65 recruitment to the NF - kappaB1 site of MIP - 1alpha without affecting the occupancy of the putative NF - kappaB2 and NF - kappaB3 sites ( Supplementary Figure S3B and S3C).

In HIV - 1 - infected monocytes Tat sustains the NF - kappaB activity and promotes the transcriptional activation of MIP - 1alpha by interacting with IkappaB - alpha and p65	"Tat	32	35	Protein"	"MIP - 1alpha	117	129	Protein"	"IkappaB - alpha	150	165	Protein"	"p65	170	173	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Tat"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""MIP - 1alpha"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IkappaB - alpha"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 165, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 170, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The Tat - dependent activation of NF - kappaB correlated with the association of the viral protein with IkappaB - alpha, which interfered with the generation of the IkappaB - alpha / p65 complex.	"Tat	4	7	Protein"	"IkappaB - alpha	104	119	Protein"	"IkappaB - alpha	165	180	Protein"	"p65	183	186	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Tat"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IkappaB - alpha"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IkappaB - alpha"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 180, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 183, ""end_span"": 186, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Differently, the Tat arginine - rich sequence ( R49, 52, 53, 55, 56, 57) was required for the binding to the sixth ankyrin of IkappaB - alpha ( 50, 51), and for releasing p65 from the IkappaB - alpha inhibition.	"Tat	17	20	Protein"	"IkappaB - alpha	126	141	Protein"	"p65	171	174	Protein"	"IkappaB - alpha	184	199	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Tat"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IkappaB - alpha"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 171, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IkappaB - alpha"", ""start_span"": 184, ""end_span"": 199, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
RNA interference of p65 abolished the Tat occupancy of the NF - kappaB enhancers indicating that the Tat binding to the NF - kappaB sites was mediated by p65.	"p65	20	23	Protein"	"Tat	38	41	Protein"	"Tat	101	104	Protein"	"p65	154	157	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Tat"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Tat"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These results were consistent with the evidence that Tat displaced p65 from the binding to IkappaB - alpha ( Figures 2D and 3C), and increased the p65 DNA binding affinity through association ( Figure 4E and F).	"Tat	53	56	Protein"	"p65	67	70	Protein"	"IkappaB - alpha	91	106	Protein"	"p65	147	150	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Tat"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IkappaB - alpha"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Indeed, IkappaB - alpha was found associated with hystone deacetylases at the hes1 promoter, from where it was removed following TNF - alpha stimulation causing histone acetylation and hes1 transcriptional activation ( 65).

Here, we have shown that the Tat - dependent transcriptional activation of a number of pro - inflammatory genes required the assembly of Tat with p65 at the NF - kappaB enhancer together with the displacement of IkappaB - alpha ( Figure 5).	"Tat	29	32	Protein"	"Tat	137	140	Protein"	"p65	146	149	Protein"	"IkappaB - alpha	212	227	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Tat"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Tat"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IkappaB - alpha"", ""start_span"": 212, ""end_span"": 227, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The evidence that Tat activates NF - kappaB through direct interaction with IkappaB - alpha and p65 may lead to specific inhibitors to counteract the Tat pro - inflammatory action.

Tat activates the p65 - dependent expression of NF - kappaB - responsive genes by occupying the NF - kappaB enhancers and promoting the p65 recruitment with IkappaB - alpha displacement.
