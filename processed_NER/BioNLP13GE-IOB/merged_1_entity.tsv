The addition PTX to LPS - stimulated cells resulted in a reduction in TNF - alpha, similar to that observed in our previous experiments ( 529 pg / mL + / - 112 vs. 37 pg / mL + / - 10; P < 0. 01).

This classic pathway has been challenged as the sole mechanism involved in the modulation of inflammation by cAMP - enhancing drugs, and alternative mechanisms involving PKA - independent pathways have been proposed. 6 - 8 In this series of experiments, we observed a significant attenuation of TNF - alpha production in LPS - stimulated human mononuclear cells following PTX administration, independent of PKA activation.

We used a nonspecific phosphodiesterase inhibitor, PTX, in the present study because it has been used clinically in the treatment of a variety of conditions in which inflammation is an important component of the pathophysiology of the disease process. 19 Additionally, the use of PTX in sepsis as an adjunct to other treatments to maintain adequate organ function has been explored based upon its effects on TNF - alpha synthesis.

However, the reported beneficial effects of PTX are not only related to the downregulation of TNF - alphabut also to PTX ' s hemorrheologic properties, its ability to reduce neutrophil activation, and its beneficial effects on microcirculation, cardiac performance, and organ injury. 20 - 25 Herein, we demonstrated that the downregulatory effects of PTX in human mononuclear cells involves modulation of pathways that involve NF - kappaB and CREB, two major transcription factors involved in the inflammatory cascade.

This group also demonstrated that forskolin did not inhibit the DNA - binding activity of NF - kappaB and that CREB was not involved in forskolin - induced decrease in p65 transcriptional activity. 33 Similar results were reported by Ollivier et al. using THP - 1 cells and endothelial cells treated with forskolin or dibutyryl cAMP, two agents known to function through cAMP elevation and subsequent PKA activation. 9 The differences between our results and those mentioned above may be explained by the use of different cell types and exogenous stimulants.	p65,168,171,Protein	"[{""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 168, ""end_span"": 171, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	train
It is also possible that PTX exerts its anti - inflammatory effects on the NF - kappaB pathway independent of PKA, as suggested by the continued attenuation of LPS - induced TNF - alpha production by PTX in the presence or absence of PKA inhibition observed in this study.

Given these relationships, it is conceivable that PTX may exert some of its anti - inflammatory actions by affecting AP - 1 activation and favoring CREB binding, thus inhibiting TNF - alpha gene transcription.

In summary, we have demonstrated that PDE inhibition of human mononuclear cells downregulates TNF - alpha production, at least in part, through a PKA - independent mechanism.

However, the signals that direct the development of IL - 10 - producing T helper 1 ( Th1) cells are undefined.	IL - 10,52,59,Protein	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	train
Despite having distinct functions in protection against pathogens, all Th cells share the important task of controlling overexuberant immune responses by means of IL - 10 production.	IL - 10,163,170,Protein	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 163, ""end_span"": 170, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	train
IL - 10 limits the immune and inflammatory responses to pathogens and gut flora and prevents damage to the host ( Moore et al., 2001; O ' Garra and Vieira, 2004), but when dysregulated may result in chronic infection ( Brooks et al., 2006; Ejrnaes et al., 2006; Moore et al., 2001).	IL - 10,0,7,Protein	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	train
IL - 10 is expressed by T helper 2 ( Th2) cells, B cells, DCs, and macrophages ( Moore et al., 2001), and also by Th1 cells ( Anderson et al., 2007; Assenmacher et al., 1994; Del Prete et al., 1993; Gerosa et al., 1996; Jankovic et al., 2007; Pohl - Koppe et al., 1998) and ( reviewed in O ' Garra and Vieira, 2007; Trinchieri, 2007), certain regulatory ( Treg) T cells ( Moore et al., 2001; O ' Garra and Vieira, 2004; Roncarolo et al., 2006), and Th17 cells ( Awasthi et al., 2007; Fitzgerald et al., 2007; McGeachy et al., 2007; Stumhofer et al., 2007).

IL - 10 production by Th1 cells was also reported in animals infected with Toxoplasma gondii ( Jankovic et al., 2002; Shaw et al., 2006) or with Leishmania major ( Anderson et al., 2007) and shown to be required for regulation of the immune response in these infections ( Anderson et al., 2007; Jankovic et al., 2007).

Because Th1 and Th2 cells cross regulate each other ' s development and function and can suppress Th17 cell responses, and all differentiate along distinct signaling pathways ( Glimcher and Murphy, 2000; Stockinger and Veldhoen, 2007), IL - 10 produced by all these Th cells may thus act as a feedback regulator to control the pathology associated with an overexuberant, albeit efficacious, inflammatory response.

In certain viral or parasitic infections ( Anderson et al., 2007; Brooks et al., 2006; Ejrnaes et al., 2006), high amounts of stimulation may lead to the chronic nonhealing infection shown to be regulated by IL - 10.

Although IL - 10 may be differentially regulated in Th1 and Th2 cells as has been reported ( Chang et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2005), some studies suggest the existence of common pathways, but the molecular basis for these is as yet unclear.

This provides a mechanism whereby a Th1 cell responds to extrinsic signals, reflecting increased inflammation in the tissue, to tightly regulate the production of IL - 10 so as to allow a protective response to eradicate a pathogen with minimal damage to the host and also prevent chronic infection.

To determine the temporal and spatial expression pattern of Sox6, Northern blot and in situ hybridization assays were employed.	Sox6,60,64,Protein	"[{""token"": ""Sox6"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
As shown in Figure 6A, Sox6 is detectable by Northern blot beginning at 10. 5 dpc, coincident with the temporal onset of definitive erythropoiesis in the liver.	Sox6,23,27,Protein	"[{""token"": ""Sox6"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Furthermore, in situ hybridization shows that Sox6 is highly transcribed in 12. 5 - dpc liver, but not in yolk sac blood islands at 7. 5 dpc ( Figure 6B).	Sox6,46,50,Protein	"[{""token"": ""Sox6"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test

Among the other Sox6 effects in erythropoiesis, we have noticed that there are more nucleated red blood cells circulating in p100H mutant mice than in WT mice at 14. 5 dpc and 18. 5 dpc ( Figure 7A).

In addition, Sox6 binds more strongly to an HMG - box dimer motif than to a single HMG - box motif [ 5].	Sox6,13,17,Protein	"[{""token"": ""Sox6"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Therefore, it appears that target genes for group D Sox proteins, such as Sox6, probably harbor pairs of HMG binding sites with a configuration compatible with binding of D - Sox protein dimers.

Therefore, one attractive model to explain how Sox6 proteins control gene expression is that they function as architectural factors bound to DNA, influencing local chromatin structure by bending DNA and by assembling multiprotein transcriptional complexes.

Moreover, in situ hybridization clearly shows that the persistent expression of epsilony globin in p100H mutant mice is due to defects in the silencing mechanism of definitive erythropoiesis that takes place in the liver ( Figure 5).	epsilony globin,80,95,Protein	"[{""token"": ""epsilony globin"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test

The restoration of normal enucleation of red cells in Sox6 - deficient mouse by postnatal day 10. 5 may result from functional compensation of other Sox proteins ( expressed at later developmental stages), since functional redundancy is a recurring theme with Sox proteins [ 13, 45, 46].

The number of neutrophils / area in the PC region ( including the vasogenic edema region and the non - vasogenic edema region) of sTNFp55R - infused animals was significantly lower than that of the saline - infused group ( Figure 6D, p < 0. 05).	sTNFp55R,130,138,Protein	"[{""token"": ""sTNFp55R"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test

To compare the functional impact of MTb stimulation on subtype - specific HIV - 1 LTR activity, we first constructed reporter plasmids containing viral subtype B, C, and E LTRs ( - 208 to + 64 nt relative to the transcription start site) linked to the firefly luciferase reporter gene.	luciferase,260,270,Protein	"[{""token"": ""luciferase"", ""start_span"": 260, ""end_span"": 270, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test

Subtype C LTRs displayed the strongest activity, while the LTRs from subtype E isolates consistently showed the weakest activity ( Figure 1A), consistent with previous studies demonstrating subtype - specific LTR activity that used TNF as a stimulus [ 38], [ 39].

We examined the requirement of NFAT5 for MTb - induced LTR activity by transfecting a wild - type and NFAT5 mutant LTR reporter construct into THP - 1 cells, followed by stimulation with an MTb lysate.

Given that macrophages, which are the primary target of MTb infection, are also a major reservoir of HIV - 1 as infection progresses [ 40], we next investigated whether MTb is able to directly enhance NFAT5 mRNA expression in primary human MDM.	NFAT5,201,206,Protein	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 201, ""end_span"": 206, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
We prepared MDM from five normal donors, stimulated the cells with the MTb lysate or left them unstimulated, and measured NFAT5 gene expression levels by quantitative real - time PCR at 24 and 48 hours.	NFAT5,122,127,Protein	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
We also investigated whether HIV - 1 infection is capable of inducing NFAT5 mRNA synthesis by infecting MDM with live or heat - inactivated R5 - tropic representatives of subtype B ( HIV - 1Bal), C ( HIV - 198IN22), or E ( HIV - 192TH64).

To extend the results we obtained in the reporter assays to a physiological TB / HIV co - infection model, we next tested the effect of siRNA - mediated ablation of NFAT5 mRNA levels in MDM co - infected with a subtype B HIV - 1Lai infectious molecular clone and a clinical isolate of MTb.

We used this approach to ensure that our analysis of the roles of NF - kappaB and NFAT5 in MTb - induced HIV - 1 replication could be interpreted in the proper context of previous research findings that examined LTR regulation in the context of full - length viral replication [ 41] - [ 46].

We note that we confirmed that HIV - 1Lai / Bal - Env grew in PBMC at a similar rate to wild - type HIV - 1Bal, indicating proper co - receptor engagement and internalization of this infectious clone ( data not shown).

As shown in Figure 2C, HIV - 1 replication was suppressed at days 6 and 9 post - infection in the NFAT5 siRNA - treated cells as compared to cells treated with control siRNA, and it was significantly inhibited by day 12 post - infection ( p < 0. 05) ( Figure 2C).

Thus, knock down of NFAT5 expression significantly impairs HIV - 1 subtype B replication in MDM co - infected with MTb.	NFAT5,20,25,Protein	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test

This series of experiments also allowed us to dissect the relative importance of NFAT5 and NF - kappaB binding to the HIV - 1 LTR in MTb regulation of HIV - 1 replication.	NFAT5,81,86,Protein	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
To perform these experiments, we constructed a panel of infectious HIV - 1Lai / Bal - env molecular clones where either the NFAT5 site was specifically disrupted or the two NF - kappaB binding sites were either individually or dually disrupted ( Figure 3A).	env,86,89,Protein	"[{""token"": ""env"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
We also created a double NF - kappaB site mutant virus ( HIV - 1Lai / Bal - env - kappaB I + II - Mut) in order to test the impact of complete disruption of NF - kappaB binding to the HIV - 1 LTR on MTb regulation.	env,76,79,Protein	"[{""token"": ""env"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
However, recombinant NFAT5 binding to the single and the double NF - kappaB mutant LTRs was not impaired and indeed appeared enhanced ( compare lanes 2 - 5 to lanes 7 - 20 of Figure 3D).

NF - kappaB and NFAT5 binding play independent activating roles in MTb - mediated induction of HIV - 1 replication	NFAT5,16,21,Protein	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
After overnight infection, cells were co - infected with MTb ( CDC1551) or mock - infected and free virus levels were detected by measuring p24 levels in culture supernatants at days 4, 7, and 12 post - HIV - 1 infection.	p24,140,143,Protein	"[{""token"": ""p24"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
However, the replication of each mutant virus was impaired to a more significant extent in the context of MTb co - infection, consistent with important roles for both NF - kappaB and NFAT5 in MTb - induced HIV - 1 replication.	NFAT5,183,188,Protein	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 183, ""end_span"": 188, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
When the cultures were co - infected with MTb, p24 levels increased when the cells were infected with either the wild - type or, to lower levels, with the kappaB - I mutant virus ( Figure 5B).	p24,47,50,Protein	"[{""token"": ""p24"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Notably, although replication of the mutant virus with the single, proximal NF - kappaB binding site mutation in the shared NFAT5 / NF - kappaB element ( HIV - 1Lai / Bal - env - kappaB I - Mut) was diminished, this was not significant at day 12 ( Figures 5B - 5D).	env,173,176,Protein	"[{""token"": ""env"", ""start_span"": 173, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
We note that overall p24 levels were noticeably lower in the cultures co - infected with MTb compared with those infected with HIV - 1 alone.	p24,21,24,Protein	"[{""token"": ""p24"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Given that NF - kappaB is efficiently activated in primary MDM in response to TLR agonists [ 51] and as we have shown in Figure 2, NFAT5 gene expression is also induced by TLR agonists, MDM are a suitable experimental system to analyze the effect of NF - kappaB versus NFAT5 binding site mutations on virus replication in isolated MDM in the absence or presence of MTb co - infection.

NFAT5 is important for enhancement of HIV - 1 subtype C replication in response to MTb infection	NFAT5,0,5,Protein	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
We thus next extended our analysis of the role of NFAT5 in MTb / HIV - 1 co - infection to a subtype C isolate.	NFAT5,50,55,Protein	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Thus, even when three functional NF - kappaB binding sites are present in the LTR, as in the HIV - 1 subtype C infectious clone studied here, disruption of NFAT5 binding to the LTR impairs virus replication in response to MTb co - infection.

We have linked this observation to MTb - stimulated HIV - 1 gene expression by showing that MTb enhances the replication of HIV - 1 subtypes B and C via a direct interaction between NFAT5 and the viral promoter.	NFAT5,182,187,Protein	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 182, ""end_span"": 187, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Thus, HIV - 1 has co - opted NFAT5, which is induced as part of the innate immune response to TB, for enhanced viral transcription / replication.	NFAT5,29,34,Protein	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Thus, NF - kappaB binding to the viral LTR is not sufficient to compensate for the loss of NFAT5 binding to the LTR under conditions of MTb co - infection.	NFAT5,91,96,Protein	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Because NF - kappaB site I overlaps the NFAT5 binding site, it is possible that loss of NF - kappaB binding to this site is mitigated, at least in part, by increased NFAT5 binding to the mutated site.	NFAT5,40,45,Protein	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Other studies have found that, in response to TNF, subtype C LTRs drive reporter gene transcription more strongly than other subtype LTRs [ 38], [ 39].	TNF,46,49,Protein	"[{""token"": ""TNF"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Given that the NF - kappaB and NFAT5 binding motifs overlap, how do NF - kappaB and NFAT5 function at this overlapping or shared site in the LTR to drive viral transcription in response to MTb infection?

While NF - kappaB presence in the nucleus declines in the hours post MTb infection [ 74], [ 75], NFAT5 levels escalate.	NFAT5,97,102,Protein	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Furthermore, hypertonic stress of mouse renal collecting duct epithelial cells results in NFAT5 and NF - kappaB complex formation at NF - kappaB - dependent gene promoters [ 77].	NFAT5,90,95,Protein	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Thus, there are precedents for imagining that NFAT5 could function at the HIV - 1 LTR by inducing histone remodeling in a manner similar to NF - kappaB ( [ 69], reviewed in [ 68], [ 70]) or by directly interacting with NF - kappaB in a cooperative manner.

Taken together, the findings presented here enhance the general understanding of the innate immune response to MTb infection by showing that NFAT5 is a major mediator of TLR - dependent gene expression; its importance for gene regulation is likely applicable to other MTb - and TLR - regulated genes.

In addition, inhibition of caspase - 8 activity alone, either through siRNA knockdown or by using the pan - caspase inhibitor, zVAD. fmk, is sufficient to trigger necroptosis in these cells [ 10], [ 14].	caspase - 8,27,38,Protein	"[{""token"": ""caspase - 8"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test

Knockdown of mTOR using siRNA further validated the small - molecule inhibitor data indicating a role for mTOR in necroptosis by protecting cells from both zVAD. fmk and TNFalpha induced death ( Fig. 5D).

[ 10] have recently reported that the induction of necroptosis by zVAD. fmk in L929 cells is associated with increased synthesis of TNFalpha, which potentiates cell death.	TNFalpha,132,140,Protein	"[{""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test

It is important to note that the cells expressing Myr - Akt were viable, grew in a manner indistinguishable from the empty vector control cells, and were not triggered to induce necroptosis by serum starvation ( Fig. 7B).

The effect of zVAD. fmk on their phosphorylation varied, likely due to the increased basal activity of Myr - Akt.	Myr - Akt,103,112,Protein	"[{""token"": ""Myr - Akt"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
It has been reported that Ala mutations at Thr308 and Ser473 cause a reduction in the catalytic activity of Akt, while Asp mutants increase activity [ 38].	Akt,108,111,Protein	"[{""token"": ""Akt"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
This suggests that T308D, in spite of being an active Akt construct, may not be a perfect mimic of phosphorylation and this mutant form of the kinase may not have sufficient activity to phosphorylate the entire repertoire of substrates in the cells.

However, we found that SP600125, which protected L929 cells from death and inhibited TNFalpha production ( Fig. 2A, B S2A S10A), inhibited both basal and post - treatment phosphorylation levels of Akt at both Ser473 and Thr308 ( Fig. S10B).

It did not, however, lead to a reduction in TNFalpha production or cell death ( Fig. S10C, D, F, G), suggesting that earlier data with SP600125 protection ( Fig. 2) could reflect off - target effects of this molecule, rather than JNK inhibition.

However, we were not able to confirm phosphorylation of these residues on endogenous Akt in L929 cells using either mass spectrometry or western blotting with a phospho - specific antibody raised against Thr435 peptide, suggesting that direct phosphorylation of Akt by RIP1 likely represents an in vitro artifact and does not reflect endogenous regulation.

This suggests that the inhibition of autophagy by Akt or mTOR in our system may contribute to necroptosis induced by TNFalpha, however, it is more difficult to reconcile with the positive role of these proteins in zVAD - induced death.
