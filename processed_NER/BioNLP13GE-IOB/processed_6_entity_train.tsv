Functional inactivation of Foxp3 by genetic mutations affecting the Foxp3 coding region, as demonstrated in IPEX, or repression of Foxp3 expression by the HTLV - I - encoded transactivator protein Tax, as recently reported in patients with HAM / TSP, results in loss of regulatory activity in CD4 + CD25hi T cells [ 4, 8, 17].

To ascertain the molecular mechanisms by which Foxp3 functions to promote the regulatory function of CD4 + CD25hi T cells, we first confirmed the function of Foxp3 as a repressor of activation of NF - kappaB, previously implicated as a target of other forkhead / winged - helix family transcription factors ( e. g., Foxj1 and Foxo3a) [ 19, 20].

Transactivation of the Gal4 - resposive promoter by Gal4 - BD - Tax remained relatively unaffected by overexpression of either EGFP ( control), Foxp3, or deltaFKH, suggesting that Foxp3 does not repress Tax transactivation by directly interfacing with the HTLV - I Tax protein.

To determine whether Foxp3 can disrupt the function / recruitment of the coactivator protein p300, we introduced a Gal4 reporter vector and a Gal4 - BD - CREB - 1 expression vector into HEK 293T cells in the absence or presence of Foxp3, p300, and / or control expression vectors ( Figure 7C).

Analysis of LMP1 transgenic mice before the development of lymphoma showed similar numbers of splenic B - 1a ( CD19 + CD5 +) and B - 1b or B - 2 populations ( CD19 + CD5 -), indicating that LMP1 does not affect B cell differentiation ( Figure 2B).

To investigate whether LMP1 affected cell cycle regulation through the Rb pathway in B cells, immunoblot analyses for pRb, Cdk2, and p27 were performed on splenic CD19 + MACS - purified B cells.

CD40 also induces downregulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 through a PI3K - dependent manner, and the LMP1 lymphoma cells also had decreased levels of p27 with phosphorylation of Rb and increased Cdk2 ( Figure 6C) [ 66].

Although the activation of Akt and the lack of Fox01 in the lymphoma cells suggest that LMP1 affects bcl6 and GC formation through this pathway, regulation of other Forkhead targets involved in cell cycle progression, such as p27 and CyclinD2, likely contribute to malignant transformation.

Our data seemed most consistent with a model in which TCR signals induce T - bet, which in turn induces IFN - gamma ( 17) and possibly granzyme B; subsequently, Eomes is induced during the period of clonal expansion in IL - 2 and activates perforin expression.

To examine the role of Eomes, we transduced naive CD8 + T cells from WT and Tbx21 - / - mice with retroviruses containing internal ribosome entry site ( IRES) - GFP that were either empty or encoded a strongly transactivating version of Eomes ( Eo - VP16) ( 8), and expanded them for 6 d under our culture conditions.

However, Eo - VP16 did not induce GzmB mRNA expression in either WT or T - bet - deficient cells; thus, the partial T - bet dependence of GzmB mRNA expression cannot be compensated for by Eo - VP16.

Because Runx3 is highly expressed in peripheral CD8 + T cells, and because of the T - bet - Runx3 cooperation we observed earlier in CD4 + T cells ( 15), we examined the role of Runx3 in effector CTL differentiation.

We previously reported that Th1 cell differentiation was regulated through a feed - forward loop in which T - bet is up - regulated early and induces Runx3, after which T - bet and Runx3 cooperate to induce IFN - gamma and silence IL - 4, thus promoting stable differentiation toward the Th1 lineage ( 15, 22).

Eomes bound primarily to the Prf1 TSS and the - 1 kb enhancer; this binding was substantially greater than that observed at the promoter of the Il2rb gene, a known direct target of Eomes ( 8), and comparable to that observed at the Ifng TSS, a known target of T - box proteins in both Th1 and CD8 + T cells ( Fig. 3 D) ( 17).

To determine whether Runx3 controlled the expression of CTL effector genes through its induction of Eomes, we retrovirally expressed Runx3 and Eo - VP16 in CD8 + T cells from Runx3 - / - mice.

Therefore, although activation of the perforin / granzyme B machinery is defective in Runx3 - / - CD8 + cells, these cells are not entirely devoid of cytolytic activity and could still effectively kill targets, possibly by alternative mechanisms such as the Fas - Fas ligand pathway.

Indeed, T - bet and Eomes both contribute to perforin expression in NK cells ( 8, 26), and Eomes induces granzyme B as effectively as T - bet in developing Th2 cells ( 7); thus, the relative roles of these T - box transcription factors vary depending on cell type.

Here, we showed that in vitro differentiation of IL - 10 - producing Th1 cells from naive CD4 + T cells required IL - 12 - induced STAT4 signaling, strong TCR activation ( high antigen dose), and sustained ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation.

In contrast, in the absence of STAT4, the percentage of cells expressing IFN - gamma was dramatically diminished as expected and resulted in an increase in the percentage of cells expressing IL - 4, but not IL - 10 ( Figure 2A), suggesting that STAT4 contributes to IL - 10 expression by Th1 cells.

To test the role of STAT4 and STAT6 signaling in the in vivo development of IL - 10 - producing Th1 cells, we transferred STAT4 - or STAT6 - deficient or WT DO11. 10 cells into recipient BALB / c mice and immunized with OVA - protein plus LPS as before.

Finally, DO11. 10 CD4 + cells that were exposed to low doses of antigen and IL - 12 during the primary differentiation phase produced high amounts of IFN - gamma but little IL - 10, but they could be induced to produce IL - 10 when both high antigen dose and IL - 12 were present during the recall phase ( Figure S4).

Our data thus suggested that IL - 10 production by Th1 cells in response to high antigen dose and IL - 12 requires ERK1 and ERK2 signaling, but not the activation of the p38 or the GSK3beta pathways.

To address whether IL - 10 production by Th2 and Th17 cells was also dependent on ERK1 and ERK2 activation, we differentiated these cells with anti - CD3 and anti - CD28 in the absence of APCs ( Shoemaker et al., 2006; Veldhoen et al., 2009; Veldhoen et al., 2006), in the presence or absence of the MEK inhibitor ( PD184352).

We showed also that like Il10 expression, c - maf expression was inhibited in Th1 and Th17 cells in the presence of the MEK1 and MEK2 inhibitor ( PD184352), whereas T - bet and RORgammat expression was hardly affected ( Figure 6D).

We provide evidence that IL - 10 is produced in canonical Th1 cells and that its expression correlates with the expression of T - bet and the highest IFN - gamma production, in keeping with our observations that high - dose antigen stimulation and IL - 12 signaling are required for IL - 10 and IFN - gamma expression.

That c - maf expression is common to IL - 10 - producing Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells and, like IL - 10, is dependent on ERK activation in Th1 and Th17 cells for its expression is of interest because c - Maf has been shown to be an essential transcription factor for IL - 10 expression in macrophages ( Cao et al., 2005).

We previously showed that the TRAF family member TRAF2 mediates recruitment of HOIL - 1L - interacting protein ( HOIP) to the cytoplasmic domain of CD40, suggesting that HOIP has a role in the CD40 signaling pathway.

The amounts of IKKalpha / beta and IKKgamma in CD40 immunoprecipitates from HOIP - reconstituted cells were similar to those detected in samples prepared from parental cells, demonstrating that the defects in IKK recruitment we observed were due specifically to the absence of HOIP expression.

The potential importance of HOIP in immune function and TNFR family signaling is further supported by the recent discovery that HOIP interacts with a protein known as SHARPIN ( SHANK - associated RH domain interacting protein in postsynaptic density), which appears capable of working together with HOIP and HOIL to mediate the assembly of linear polyubiquitin [ 14], [ 23], [ 24].

We did not find that PKC was involved in IkappaBalpha degradation or NF - kappaB p65 nuclear translocation induced by M - CSF, but that M - CSF - induced phosphorylation of NF - kappaB p65 at Ser276 was dramatically reduced by the conventional PKC inhibitor and kinase deficient PKCalpha and by siRNA towards PKCalpha.
