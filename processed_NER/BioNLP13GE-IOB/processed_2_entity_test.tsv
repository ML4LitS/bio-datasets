Similarly, IL - 2 production was not affected by 1 ng / ml IL - 10 in RA patients ( percentage decrease, - 2. 1 + / - 13. 8%), while it was significantly reduced in healthy controls ( 61. 1 + / - 13. 7%; P < 0. 05).

3a, 3b, the intensity of IL - 10R1 expression on CD4 + T cells was significantly increased in RA patients compared with in healthy controls.

IL - 10 inhibits the tyrosine phosphorylation of the CD28 molecule and the subsequent phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase binding in T cells, and thereby directly acts on T cells [ 24].

IL - 10 - mediated inhibition of CD4 + T - cell cytokine production is principally dependent on its inhibition of macrophage antigen - presenting cell function [ 1].

However, this indirect inhibitory effect is thought to be restricted at the site of T - cell activation in RA, because macrophages in the ST express high levels of cytokines, CD80 and CD86 molecules, and MHC class II antigens [ 10, 18 - 20].

More importantly, IL - 10 - mediated STAT3 activation is mostly undetectable in RA synovial macrophages.

However, SOCS3 is dispensable for both the negative feedback inhibition and the immunoregulatory action of IL - 10 in macrophages [ 41].

On the contrary, SOCS1 was found to directly inhibit IL - 10 - mediated signaling [ 43].

It is of interest in this regard to indicate that polarized Th1 and Th2 cells express high levels of SOCS1 and SOCS3 mRNA, respectively [ 44].

Consistent with this notion, PB T cells from patients with allergic diseases significantly express high levels of SOCS3 transcripts, and the SOCS3 expression correlates well with serum IgE levels and disease pathology [ 45].

The limited efficacy of IL - 10 treatment of RA patients [ 50] may be explained in part by the unresponsiveness to IL - 10 of inflammatory cells, including T cells.

However, it can also be produced by CD8 + T cells via an IL - 23 triggering mechanism in Gram - negative pulmonary infection [ 14].

We therefore investigated the in vitro production of IL - 17 in RA PBMC responding to a variety of cytokines / chemokines and mitogens as well as T cell receptor ( TCR) ligation using anti - CD3 / anti - CD28.

As reported for normal individuals [ 25], T cell activation through anti - CD3 / anti - CD28 also increases IL - 17 induction in RA PBMC.

Although the signaling pathway for the induction of cytokines / chemokines by IL - 17 has been documented widely [ 8, 30, 31], no data have been available on how IL - 17 production can be regulated by certain signaling pathways.

We identified that anti - CD3 - induced IL - 17 production in RA PBMC was significantly hampered by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and the NF - kappaB inhibitor PDTC to comparable levels of basal production without stimulation.

The fact that Akt is phosphorylated upon anti - CD3 stimulation suggests the possible involvement of PI3K in the induction of IL - 17 in RA.

Although PI3K and its downstream kinase Akt in association with NF - kappaB have been reported to deliver activating signals in many cell types, the data on the signal inducing IL - 17 are lacking.

Considering its proinflammatory activities and successful induction of anti - IL - 17 for ameliorating arthritis in animal models [ 2, 6, 34 - 36], understanding the IL - 17 signaling pathway is an important element of developing new targeted therapies in RA.

We have also shown that upregulation of IL - 17 by activated T cells in patients with RA could be the result of activation via the PI3K / Akt pathway with resultant NF - kappaB activation.

Sox6 is a member of the Sox transcription factor family that is defined by the conserved high mobility group ( HMG) DNA binding domain, first described in the testis determining gene, Sry.

In the Sox6 - deficient mouse, p100H, epsilony globin is persistently expressed, and increased numbers of nucleated red cells are present in the fetal circulation.

Transfection assays in GM979 ( erythroleukemic) cells define a 36 - base pair region of the epsilony proximal promoter that is critical for Sox6 mediated repression.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP) assays demonstrate that Sox6 acts as a repressor by directly binding to the epsilony promoter.

Thus, Sox6 regulation of epsilony globin might provide a novel therapeutical target in the treatment of hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemia.

Regardless of how Sox6 functions in regulating gene expression, previous studies have demonstrated that Sox6 is an important regulatory molecule that plays a role in the development of the central nervous system [ 8 - 11], cartilage [ 6, 12, 13], and muscle [ 14, 15].

The p100H mutant allele is associated with a Chromosome 7 inversion that disrupts both the p gene and the Sox6 gene ( and no other gene within 50, 000 nucleotides of the chromosomal breakpoints) [ 14].

Because the p gene functions solely in pigmentation [ 16], the Sox6 transcription factor is implicated in all other phenotypes.

In mice, erythropoiesis originates in the embryonic yolk sac where primitive erythroid cells express epsilony and betah - 1 globins [ 22].

At 11. 5 d post coitus ( dpc), erythropoiesis shifts to the fetal liver where definitive erythroid cells express adult beta globins ( beta major and minor) [ 22].

In definitive erythropoiesis, epsilon is activated and silenced autonomously [ 24, 25], although in primitive erythropoiesis epsilon also appears to be regulated competitively [ 26].

All the elements responsible for silencing the epsilon globin gene are within the epsilon gene or in adjacent sequences [ 27], suggesting that silencing is primarily gene autonomous.

Here we describe and characterize the effects of Sox6 on the epsilony globin gene.

We show that Sox6 binds to the proximal promoter of epsilony globin and represses its transcription.

In wild - type ( WT) mice, Sox6 is not expressed in yolk sac blood islands, but is expressed in fetal liver, the opposite expression pattern of epsilony globin.

The epsilony globin gene was initially identified as an upregulated transcript in the p100H mouse using subtractive hybridization to identify Sox6 downstream targets.

Real - time PCR assays ( Figure 1) measure steady - state levels of epsilony mRNA, not transcriptional activity of the epsilony promoter.

Sox6 is able to physically associate with the 36 - bp region ( Figure 3B) within the epsilony promoter defined by the deletion analysis experiments ( Figure 2C).

MEL cells, a murine erythroleukemic cell line, express adult beta globins, but not epsilony [ 33].

To investigate the functional significance of the intact Sox / Sox6 binding sites, the epsilony promoter reporter constructs with mutagenized Sox / Sox6 binding sites were co - transfected with the Sox6 overexpression vector into GM979 cells.

Thus, both sites are required for maximal repression of epsilony by Sox6, but not to the same degree.

We also tested whether Sox6 binds to the epsilony promoter in vivo using chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP) ( Figure 4).

However, the expression of betamaj / min globin is equally abundant in both WT and p100H mutant mice ( Figure 5 E and F).

These data, taken together with the observation that epsilony globin is highly expressed in the liver cells of 14. 5 - dpc p100H mutant mice ( Figure 5), demonstrate that Sox6 functions in definitive erythropoiesis.

Functionally, dimerization of Sox5 and Sox6 has been shown to greatly increase the binding efficiency of the two Sox proteins to DNA that contains adjacent Sox sites [ 6].

Indeed, in the present study, the defined Sox6 target sequence of the epsilony promoter contains two Sox / Sox6 consensus sites ( Figure 3A).

These observations suggest that Sox6 binds to this sequence of the epsilony promoter either as a homodimer or as a heterodimer with other Sox proteins.

In our EMSAs, we had to run the electrophoresis on a 4% - 6% gel for at least 4 - 8 h to detect the Sox6 - associated band, suggesting that Sox6 is part of a high molecular weight complex.

Employing a comprehensive methodological approach, the aim of our in vitro study was to elucidate novel molecular and cellular mechanisms of human peripheral blood immune cells mediated by a fungal beta - 1 to 3 - D - glucan, i. e. glucan phosphate, in the presence of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) or toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 ( TSST - 1).

Glucan phosphate - treated leukocytes induced a substantial amount of IL - 8 ( peak at 18 h: 5000 pg / ml), likely due to binding of NFkappaB to a consensus site in the IL - 8 promoter.

One study proposed that the production of the anti - inflammatory IL - 1RA, but not IL - 1 by human monocytes may be a potentially protective mechanism induced by beta - 1 to 3 - D - glucan [ 17].

Because of the anti - inflammatory role of IL - 1RA, we focused on binding of transcription factors to the IL - 1RA promoter.

( n = 4; p < 0. 05 vs. GP / TSST - 1 calc. and p = 0. 07 vs. TSST - 1; Fig. 1B).

GP was also able to induce band shifts indicative of binding of particular variants of NFAT to an oligo from the IFNgamma promoter ( Fig. 1A).

Cytokine profile of human PBMC following a 48 h in vitro stimulation with LPS, TSST - 1, GP, GP + LPS and GP + TSST - 1	"TSST - 1	79	87	Protein"	"TSST - 1	111	119	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TSST - 1"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TSST - 1"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
On the whole, GP mediated a reduction of the TSST - 1 - induced amount of IL - 1beta by about 50% ( Fig. 3A).	"TSST - 1	45	53	Protein"	"IL - 1beta	74	84	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TSST - 1"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 1beta"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
GP induced only a small amount of IL - 6 and there was no significant alteration of the LPS - induced IL - 6 production by GP.

Besides IL - 8, IL - 1RA was the only mediator which was produced in significant quantities following GP treatment, especially at 24 h ( n = 14, p < 0. 01).	"IL - 8	8	14	Protein"	"IL - 1RA	16	24	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 8"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 1RA"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Over the time course of 48 h, GP elevated the TSST - 1 - induced amount of IL - 1RA by approximately 200% ( Fig. 3B).	"TSST - 1	46	54	Protein"	"IL - 1RA	75	83	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TSST - 1"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 1RA"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Positive correlation between GP - induced IL - 8 and IL - 1RA productions.

Following stimulation with GP ( 24 h), we observed a positive correlation between IL - 8 and IL - 1RA.

Moreover, we found this correlation to be dose - dependent, since 100 mug of GP induced larger amounts of IL - 8 and IL - 1RA than 1 mug GP ( n = 5, p < = 0. 002, r = 0. 9 and 0. 98, respectively).	"IL - 8	106	112	Protein"	"IL - 1RA	117	125	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 8"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 1RA"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Further, GP + TSST - 1 induced an increased binding to the NFIL - 6 site in comparison with TSST - 1 ( 1. 3fold) or GP ( 1. 6fold; p < 0. 05), ( data not shown).	"TSST - 1	14	22	Protein"	"TSST - 1	92	100	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TSST - 1"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TSST - 1"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In addition, binding to the NFATP2 / 3 site following both, GP + LPS ( 1. 4fold of GP) and GP + TSST - 1 ( 1. 5fold of GP, 1. 25fold of TSST - 1) was elevated ( p < 0. 05; Fig. 5), but only in an additive synergistic manner, i. e. the experimental results were not different from the theoretical values ( calc.).	"TSST - 1	96	104	Protein"	"TSST - 1	136	144	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TSST - 1"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TSST - 1"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In a simplified approach, IL - 1beta and IL - 1RA might represent two sides of a coin, i. e. pro - or anti - inflammatory action.	"IL - 1beta	26	36	Protein"	"IL - 1RA	41	49	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 1beta"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 1RA"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, we applied the IL - 1beta / IL - 1RA ratio as an indicator of the degree of inflammation.	"IL - 1beta	26	36	Protein"	"IL - 1RA	39	47	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 1beta"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 1RA"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Both, LPS and GP + LPS treatments resulted in generating more IL - 1beta than IL - 1RA at early time points, i. e. up to 24 h.

Comparing LPS vs. GP + LPS, we did not find substantial alterations over a time course of 48 h in the IL - 1beta / IL - 1RA ratio, only a - non - significant - 2. 5fold higher ratio at 6 h.	"IL - 1beta	102	112	Protein"	"IL - 1RA	115	123	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 1beta"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 1RA"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Pharmacological inhibitors were used to demonstrate that the transcription factor sites within the IL - 1RA promoter are relevant for the induction of IL - 1RA by GP.	"IL - 1RA	99	107	Protein"	"IL - 1RA	151	159	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 1RA"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 1RA"", ""start_span"": 151, ""end_span"": 159, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We confirmed and extended previous results [ 13 - 16] indicating that, in the absence of other stimuli, beta - 1 to 3 - D - glucans induced binding of NFkappaB -, NFIL - 6 - and NFAT - mers to cytokine promoters.	"NFIL - 6	163	171	Protein"	"NFAT	178	182	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NFIL - 6"", ""start_span"": 163, ""end_span"": 171, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""NFAT"", ""start_span"": 178, ""end_span"": 182, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Because of the multiple band shifts observed for NFAT binding ( Fig. 1A), one could speculate that there is activation of several different NFAT isoforms, probably derived from alternative splicing [ 38].	"NFAT	49	53	Protein"	"NFAT	140	144	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NFAT"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""NFAT"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Interestingly, the GP - induced transcription factor binding transformed only into a very limited cytokine response, namely IL - 8 and IL - 1RA ( Fig. 3B).	"IL - 8	124	130	Protein"	"IL - 1RA	135	143	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 8"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 1RA"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Hence, our data are in aggreement with the few reports describing a beta - 1 to 3 - D - glucan - mediated IL - 8 [ 6, 16, 19] and IL - 1RA production [ 17].	"IL - 8	106	112	Protein"	"IL - 1RA	130	138	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 8"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 1RA"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Flow cytometric experiments seemed to confirm that monocytes and neutrophils were able to produce IL - 8 just as IL - 1RA in response to GP ( data not shown).	"IL - 8	98	104	Protein"	"IL - 1RA	113	121	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 8"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 1RA"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This GP - induced cytokine profile was substantially more restricted than that of LPS or TSST - 1, which is likely due to differences in recognition and signaling between LPS, TSST - 1 and GP.	"TSST - 1	89	97	Protein"	"TSST - 1	176	184	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TSST - 1"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TSST - 1"", ""start_span"": 176, ""end_span"": 184, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Recognition of LPS is mainly mediated through Toll - like receptor 4 and subsequent signaling via the NFkappaB pathway, leading to expression of pro - inflammatory mediators like TNFalpha [ 43].	"Toll - like receptor 4	46	68	Protein"	"TNFalpha	179	187	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Toll - like receptor 4"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 179, ""end_span"": 187, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Altogether, the induction of the neutrophil - attracting IL - 8 and the anti - inflammatory IL - 1RA by fungal carbohydrates ( GP) may well fit to a benign PAMP response, mounting defensive mechanisms against a possible microbial attack.	"IL - 8	57	63	Protein"	"IL - 1RA	92	100	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 8"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 1RA"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These seemingly contradictory data could be explained by differences in either NFkappaB subunits or conserved nucleotides ( # 1, 2, 3, 10) within the decameric NFkappaB binding motif between the TNFalpha and the IL - 1RA promoter ( for NFkappaB3 the IL - 1RA motif contains a T on position 10 instead of the conserved C in the TNFalpha motif, see Table 1), probably leading to differences in binding [ 41, 42].

It has been demonstrated that in septic / LPS - adapted leukocytes the PI3K pathway selectively controls sIL - 1RA but not IL - 1beta production [ 48].

Together with the in vivo studies [ 22, 37], our findings might support the concept of protective effects mediated by glucan phosphate in pro - inflammatory conditions, especially with a dysregulated IL - 1beta / IL - 1RA ratio [ 52, 53].

To explore the distribution of TLR4 protein, the TLR4 was detected by immunohistochemistry ( IHC).

Our data showed that transcription of TLR4 as well as the expression of TLR4 protein after ICH significantly elevated in brain tissue.

Activation of TLR4 stimulates IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and degradation, resulting in nuclear translocation of NFkappaB, which initiates transcription of genes associated with innate immune responses and inflammation [ 5, 6].

Our data suggest that ICH stimulates activation of the TLR4 / NFkappaB signaling pathway, which is consistent with previous reports that activation of NFkappaB is regulated through the TLR4 - mediated signaling pathway.

It may be speculated that these molecules produced in damaged brain or came from blood cells and constituents of plasma server as endogenous TLR4 ligands, activate TLR4 - mediated NFkappaB signaling, and initiate the inflammatory responses in IHC brain.

In conclusion, the present study demonstrated the temporal profile of the activation of TLR4 - mediated NFkappaB signaling in brain tissue in a rat model of experimental ICH, which suggests that TLR4 - mediated NFkappaB signaling participates in the pathogenesis of ICH, which may be a therapeutic target for the prevention of ICH - induced brain damage.

Next to its role in proinflammatory gene expression, NF - kappaB is also essential for osteoclastogenesis, mainly by mediating the effects of receptor activator of NF - kappaB ligand ( RANKL).

It is well accepted that proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL - 1 play an important role, and administration of TNF antagonists is an effective treatment for severe RA ( reviewed in [ 9]).

The canonical NF - kappaB pathway plays a major role in innate and adaptive immunity, and is triggered by many stimuli including proinflammatory cytokines ( for example, TNF, IL - 1), antigens, RANKL, and TLR ligands.

The recent identification of a distinct E2 / E3 enzyme complex that modifies NEMO with linear polyubiquitin chains and is essential for TNF - activated NF - kappaB signalling adds further complexity [ 22].

Both pathways then activate TAK1 and IKK in a ubiquitination - dependent manner similar to the TNF pathway ( Figure 1).

IKK1 has also been shown to inhibit nuclear NF - kappaB and to downregulate proinflammatory signalling by phosphorylating STAT1 [ 35].

The association of A20 with its targets requires specific ubiquitin - binding adaptor proteins, including A20 - binding inhibitor of NF - kappaB ( ABIN) 1 and Tax1 - binding protein 1 [ 43 - 46].

A20 - deficient cells are also more susceptible to TNF - mediated apoptosis, confirming its role as an antiapoptotic protein.

Interestingly, A20 expression is itself regulated by NF - kappaB [ 50], implicating A20 in the negative feedback regulation of NF - kappaB signalling.

Although the identified variants are not located in a gene, they are thought to influence A20 as its nearest gene ( ~ 150 kb downstream of A20), probably by the presence of potential regulatory DNA elements in this region.	"A20	90	93	Protein"	"A20	139	142	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""A20"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""A20"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Recently, Elsby and colleagues functionally evaluated in vitro the regulatory ability of RA - associated SNP variants on A20 promoter activity, and could show repressed A20 transcription for some of the SNPs investigated [ 53].

Unexpectedly, both ABIN - 1 - deficient and ABIN - 2 - deficient mice exhibit only slightly increased or normal NF - kappaB responses, respectively, possibly reflecting redundant NF - kappaB inhibitory activities of multiple ABINs [ 55, 56].

Functional ABIN - 3 is expressed in humans, but mice only express a truncated and inactive form lacking the crucial ubiquitin - binding domain [ 57].

In a recent study, inhibition of TLR responses by immunoreceptor tyrosine - based activation motif ( ITAM) - coupled receptors was shown to depend on the expression of the NF - kappaB inhibitory proteins ABIN - 3 and A20.

As A20 is only expressed in many cell types upon stimulation, it has been suggested that this protein mainly regulates later phases of NF - kappaB signalling, whereas CYLD would regulate constitutive and early signalling.

Given the important role of IL - 1R and TLR signalling in the chronic inflammation observed in RA [ 68], a regulatory role for SIGIRR in RA is not unlikely.

This inhibitory function of SIGIRR was further confirmed in vivo, since SIGIRR - deficient mice developed a more severe disease in zymosan - induced arthritis, as well as collagen - induced arthritis mouse models [ 70].

It will be interesting to compare the expression of SIGIRR in RA patients with its expression in control patients, or to investigate whether the function of SIGIRR is compromised in RA patients.

TRAF1 is a unique member of the TRAF protein family because it lacks a RING finger domain and therefore lacks ubiquitin ligase activity.

TRAF1 - deficient dendritic cells, however, show attenuated responses to secondary stimulation by TRAF2 - dependent factors, suggesting a positive regulatory role in these cells.

Influenza A virus ( IAV) produces double - stranded RNA as an intermediate during the replication life cycle, which activates the intracellular pathogen recognition receptor RIG - I and induces the production of proinflammatory cytokines and antiviral interferon.

Here, we demonstrate that silencing of the expression of the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells 5 ( NFAT5) by RNA interference ( RNAi) inhibits Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( MTb) - stimulated HIV - 1 replication in co - infected macrophages.

Thus, the innate immune response to MTb infection induces NFAT5 gene and protein expression, and NFAT5 plays a crucial role in MTb regulation of HIV - 1 replication via a direct interaction with the viral promoter.

We previously showed that the most primordial member of the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT) family, NFAT5 ( also known as TonEBP), binds to a site within the HIV - 1 LTR that is highly conserved across all HIV - 1 subtypes, and is also conserved in HIV - 2 and SIV LTRs.

Moreover, we demonstrate that MTb infection increases NFAT5 gene expression in human monocytes in a MyD88 - dependent manner.

Thus, these results expand the known stimuli of NFAT5 expression to the PRR - mediated innate immune response, and demonstrate that NFAT5 is a critical modulator of MTb - induced enhancement of HIV - 1 replication.

Although the transcription factor NFAT5 binds to a core NF - kappaB binding motif in the HIV - 1 LTR enhancer region of subtype B, when two thymines ( TT) are changed to cytosines ( CC) in the proximal NF - kappaB binding motif ( named N5 - Mut) ( bottom of Figure 1B), the binding of NFAT5 can be disrupted while leaving binding of NF - kappaB unperturbed [ 31].

To determine whether MTb lysate stimulation directly enhances NFAT5 expression in THP - 1 cells, we stimulated cells for 8 or 24 hours or left them unstimulated and examined NFAT5 protein levels by western blot.	"NFAT5	62	67	Protein"	"NFAT5	174	179	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 174, ""end_span"": 179, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As shown in Figure 1C, we found that NFAT5 protein levels steadily increased in response to MTb lysate stimulation, revealing that TLR engagement by MTb results in enhanced levels of NFAT5, consistent with its playing a role in MTb - induced activation of the HIV - 1 LTR.	"NFAT5	37	42	Protein"	"NFAT5	183	188	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 183, ""end_span"": 188, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As shown in Figure 2A, stimulation with MTb lysate significantly increased NFAT5 mRNA levels at 24 ( p < 0. 05) and 48 ( p < 0. 01) hours, whereas infection with viable or heat - inactivated HIV - 1 isolates did not increase NFAT5 mRNA levels ( Figure 2A).

To perform this experiment, we first constructed an HIV - 1Lai clone bearing the CCR5 - tropic envelope region of HIV - 1Bal ( HIV - 1Lai / Bal - env) so that it would efficiently infect primary MDM.

Specifically, we constructed a clone in which the NFAT5 binding site was mutated ( named HIV - 1Lai / Bal - env - N5 - Mut) by changing the CC dinucleotide to TT in the core NFAT5 binding site and introduced substitution mutations into the NF - kappaB / NFAT5 shared binding element that we predicted would disrupt NF - kappaB binding but preserve NFAT5 binding.

By contrast, changing the GG dinucleotide to TA in either NF - kappaB binding motif, as predicted, inhibited p50 / p65 binding at each site ( compare lanes 2 - 5 with lanes 7 - 10 and lanes 12 - 15 of Figure 3C).	"p50	109	112	Protein"	"p65	115	118	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""p50"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As expected, mutation of both NF - kappaB sites ( kappaB I + II - Mut) resulted in abrogation of p50 / p65 binding to the LTR.

We next examined the functional impact of specifically disrupting NF - kappaB or NFAT5 binding on regulation of HIV - 1 replication by infecting bulk PBMC from four normal donors with the wild - type or mutant HIV - 1Lai / Bal - env molecular clones.

To begin to decipher the cellular mechanisms underlying NFAT5 - dependent, MTb - induced HIV - 1 replication, we next investigated the requirement for specific signaling molecules in the TLR pathway that are required for MTb stimulation of NFAT5 gene expression.	"NFAT5	56	61	Protein"	"NFAT5	240	245	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 240, ""end_span"": 245, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We began by examining the requirement of TLR2 ligation in enhancing NFAT5 mRNA levels.

When THP - 1 cells were treated with the TLR2 - specific agonist Pam3Cys for 16 hours, NFAT5 mRNA levels were significantly increased in Pam3Cys - stimulated cells as compared to mock - stimulated control cells ( Figure 7A).	"TLR2	41	45	Protein"	"NFAT5	87	92	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TLR2"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Notably, MTb infection enhanced NFAT5 mRNA levels to a greater extent than Pam3Cys stimulation, suggesting that additional PRRs may be triggered during actual MTb infection, augmenting its stimulatory effect on NFAT5 gene expression ( Figure 7A).	"NFAT5	32	37	Protein"	"NFAT5	211	216	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 211, ""end_span"": 216, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The adaptor molecule MyD88 transmits signals upon TLR2 ligation ( reviewed in [ 53]).

To confirm that this protein and, therefore, that this TLR - dependent pathway is important for MTb induction of NFAT5 gene expression, we constructed a THP - 1 cell line that constitutively expresses a lentivirally - delivered short hairpin ( sh) RNA targeting MyD88.	"NFAT5	113	118	Protein"	"MyD88	262	267	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""MyD88"", ""start_span"": 262, ""end_span"": 267, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Real - time PCR analysis demonstrated that MyD88 mRNA levels in these cells were constitutively and significantly reduced in comparison to control THP - 1 cells transduced with a lentivirus expressing control GFP shRNA ( data not shown).

These MyD88 knockdown THP - 1 cells were then infected with MTb ( CDC1551) and NFAT5 mRNA levels were examined.	"MyD88	6	11	Protein"	"NFAT5	79	84	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MyD88"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
For a negative control, we measured mRNA levels of the MyD88 - independent gene CD86 [ 55], [ 56].	"MyD88	55	60	Protein"	"CD86	80	84	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MyD88"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD86"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, MTb regulation of NFAT5 is dependent upon MyD88.	"NFAT5	24	29	Protein"	"MyD88	48	53	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""MyD88"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Based on our demonstration here that the host innate immune response to MTb infection induces MyD88 - dependent upregulation of NFAT5 gene expression, we have expanded this list to include MTb as an additional stimulus.	"MyD88	94	99	Protein"	"NFAT5	128	133	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MyD88"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Multiple studies of HIV - 1 activation have shown that initial recruitment of the NF - kappaB p50 / p65 heterodimer to the HIV - 1 proviral enhancer region is crucial for HIV gene transcription ( reviewed in [ 67], [ 68]).	"p50	94	97	Protein"	"p65	100	103	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""p50"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This hypothesis is consistent with our quantitative DNase I footprinting analysis that shows that specific disruption of NF - kappaB site I results in enhanced binding of NFAT5 to the LTR.

In the co - infection model utilized in this report, in which clinical isolates of both MTb and HIV - 1 subtype C were used to infect freshly prepared human peripheral blood cells, we found that specific disruption of NFAT5 binding to the LTR significantly impaired viral replication during MTb co - infection, indicating that even the presence of three intact NF - kappaB binding sites, which is typical for HIV - 1 subtype C isolates [ 30], cannot compensate for loss of NFAT5 recruitment to the viral LTR in the context of MTb co - infection.

Because NFAT5 expression continues to rise for at least 48 hours post - MTb infection ( Figure 2A), one possibility is that the host factors NF - kappaB and NFAT5 associate with the LTR at different stages after viral activation.	"NFAT5	8	13	Protein"	"NFAT5	157	162	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 162, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, NFAT5, which is pivotal for HIV - 1 transcription in unstimulated cells [ 31], may, after Mtb infection, perpetuate viral transcriptional initiation begun by NF - kappaB and, with Tat levels also elevated, promote high levels of sustained HIV - 1 transcription.

Functional NF - kappaB interaction with the viral LTR is also required, but fully intact NF - kappaB binding elements are unable to compensate for the loss of NFAT5 recruitment to the viral promoter.

Quantitative real - time PCR analysis of NFAT5 mRNA expression levels revealed that the low, constitutively present level of NFAT5 mRNA expressed in untreated cells was not affected by exposure to live or inactivated HIV - 1, but was significantly increased at both 24 ( *, p < 0. 05) and 48 ( * *, p < 0. 01) hours following infection with MTb.

MDM ( 1x106 cells / well in a 6 - well plate) from four normal donors were transfected with siRNA specific for NFAT5 or, as a control, GFP, and were then infected with MTb ( 1: 1 MDM: bacilli) or left uninfected.

In this work, we investigated the signaling mechanisms controlled by the necroptosis mediator receptor interacting protein - 1 ( RIP1) kinase.	"receptor interacting protein - 1	94	126	Protein"	"RIP1	129	133	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""receptor interacting protein - 1"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RIP1"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Akt activity, mediated in part through mTORC1, links RIP1 to JNK activation and autocrine production of TNFalpha.	"RIP1	53	57	Protein"	"TNFalpha	104	112	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RIP1"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
A complex consisting of two related Ser / Thr kinases, RIP1 and RIP3, plays a critical role in the initiation of necroptosis in multiple systems [ 7], [ 8], [ 9].	"RIP1	55	59	Protein"	"RIP3	64	68	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RIP1"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RIP3"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, the specific signaling pathways activated during necroptosis and their connections to RIP1 and RIP3 remain poorly understood.	"RIP1	95	99	Protein"	"RIP3	104	108	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RIP1"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RIP3"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Importantly, RIP1 kinase dependent activation of JNK and TNFalpha production has recently been described to be independent of its role in necroptosis [ 15].	"RIP1	13	17	Protein"	"TNFalpha	57	65	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RIP1"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore, the key question of whether insulin - dependent Akt activity solely provides an environment conducive for necroptosis or if Akt activation is an intrinsic component of necroptosis signaling that is linked to RIP1 kinase has not been explored.	"insulin	41	48	Protein"	"RIP1	221	225	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""insulin"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RIP1"", ""start_span"": 221, ""end_span"": 225, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore, we found that downstream Akt signaling through mTORC1 and S6 contributes to the activation of necroptosis and TNFalpha production.	"S6	71	73	Protein"	"TNFalpha	123	131	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""S6"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Further data suggested that in multiple other cell types including FADD deficient Jurkat cells, RAW and J774. 1 macrophage cell lines, and mouse lung fibroblasts Akt provides a key link to TNFalpha production, but is dispensible for cell death per se.	"FADD	67	71	Protein"	"TNFalpha	189	197	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FADD"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 189, ""end_span"": 197, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Interestingly, while necroptosis was initially identified as a back - up form of cell death triggered by pro - apoptotic stimuli in the presence of apoptosis inhibitors [ 17], recent analysis of physiological cell death during mouse development has suggested that the loss of apoptotic regulators, such as caspase - 8 and FADD [ 18], [ 19], [ 20], leads to robust induction of necroptosis and death of E10. 5 embryos even though apoptosis is not normally induced in wild type embryos.	"caspase - 8	306	317	Protein"	"FADD	322	326	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""caspase - 8"", ""start_span"": 306, ""end_span"": 317, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FADD"", ""start_span"": 322, ""end_span"": 326, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In contrast, TNFalpha triggered necroptosis equally efficiently in the absence of serum ( Fig. 1A), suggesting that either growth factors and zVAD. fmk or TNFalpha are required for necroptotic death in L929 cells.	"TNFalpha	13	21	Protein"	"TNFalpha	155	163	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 163, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To further validate the role of RIP1, we used an inactive analog, 7 - Cl - O - Nec - 1i ( Nec - 1i) ( Fig. S1A), which contains an extra N - methyl group that leads to almost complete loss of RIP1 kinase inhibitory activity in vitro [ 23].	"RIP1	32	36	Protein"	"RIP1	192	196	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RIP1"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RIP1"", ""start_span"": 192, ""end_span"": 196, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Nec - 1i was unable to protect L929 cell death under serum condtions treated with zVAD. fmk or TNFalpha ( Fig. S1B) or serum free conditions treated with bFGF / zVAD. fmk ( Fig. S1C).	"TNFalpha	95	103	Protein"	"bFGF	154	158	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""bFGF"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We used two bFGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( PD173074 and PD166866), and determined that inhibition of bFGF signaling strongly inhibited zVAD. fmk - induced necroptosis under normal serum conditions ( Fig. 1D).	"bFGF receptor tyrosine kinase	12	41	Protein"	"bFGF	113	117	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bFGF receptor tyrosine kinase"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""bFGF"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In contrast, neither bFGF receptor inhibitor was able to attenuate TNFalpha - induced necroptosis ( Fig. 1D), consistent with growth factors being dispensable for this pathway ( Fig. 1A).	"bFGF receptor	21	34	Protein"	"TNFalpha	67	75	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bFGF receptor"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Inhibition of Akt ( Akt inhibitor VIII) strongly protected the cells from growth factor - sensitive necroptosis induced by zVAD. fmk [ 16] as well as cell death triggered by bFGF or IGF - 1 / zVAD. fmk under serum free conditions ( Fig. 2B).	"bFGF	174	178	Protein"	"IGF - 1	182	189	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bFGF"", ""start_span"": 174, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IGF - 1"", ""start_span"": 182, ""end_span"": 189, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
No expression of Akt3 was seen in L929 cells ( Fig. S2C) and, consistently, Akt3 siRNA had no additional effect on necroptosis.	"Akt3	17	21	Protein"	"Akt3 siRNA	76	86	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Akt3"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Akt3 siRNA"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The RIP1 kinase inhibitor, Nec - 1, completely prevented the increase in Thr308 Akt phosphorylation, while Nec - 1i did not ( Fig. 3A, Fig. S1D).	"RIP1	4	8	Protein"	"Akt	80	83	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RIP1"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Akt"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We found that the addition of bFGF alone or in combination with zVAD. fmk led to a substantial rapid and transient increase in both Thr308 and Ser473 phosphorylation of Akt as well as JNK and c - Jun at 15 minutes, reflecting the expected response to growth factor stimulation ( Fig. 3C).	"bFGF	30	34	Protein"	"c - Jun	192	199	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bFGF"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""c - Jun"", ""start_span"": 192, ""end_span"": 199, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Significantly, the combination of bFGF / zVAD. fmk, but not bFGF alone, also caused a robust, second, delayed increase in the phosphorylation of Thr308, but not Ser473, of Akt as well as a delayed increase in the phosphorylation of JNK and Jun.	"bFGF	34	38	Protein"	"bFGF	60	64	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bFGF"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""bFGF"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Consistent with TNFalpha inducing necroptosis independently of growth factors ( Fig. 1A), FGFR inhibitors did not attenuate TNFalpha - induced changes in Akt or JNK phosphorylation, while efficiently preventing these changes in response to zVAD. fmk ( Fig. S4A).	"TNFalpha	16	24	Protein"	"TNFalpha	124	132	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore, addition of TNFalpha led to comparable late activation of Akt p308 signal under both normal and serum free conditions ( Fig. S4B, C), indicating that TNFalpha signaling to Akt Thr308 is growth factor - independent.	"TNFalpha	25	33	Protein"	"TNFalpha	163	171	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 163, ""end_span"": 171, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
TNFalpha treatment caused an early and robust increase in the phosphorylation of JNK and c - Jun.

Secondly, we saw that the ability of the Akt inhibitor to protect cells from necroptosis rapidly declined after 6 hrs of stimulation with zVAD. fmk, TNFalpha or bFGF / zVAD. fmk and no protection was observed when the inhibitor was added at 9 hrs ( Fig. 4B, C).

Finally, we terminated the bFGF signal one hour after addition of bFGF by the addition of PD173074.

mTORC1 regulates translation through activation of p70S6 kinase and, subsequently, ribosomal protein S6 [ 32].

Consistently, we found that the small molecule inhibitor of p70S6K PF - 4708671 [ 33] attenuated necroptosis at the concentrations required to block S6 phosphorylation ( Fig. S5C, D).	"p70S6K	60	66	Protein"	"S6	149	151	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""p70S6K"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""S6"", ""start_span"": 149, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
RIP1 kinase, Akt, mTORC1 and JNK control the upregulation of TNFalpha accompanying necroptosis.

Under serum free conditions, bFGF alone triggered some induction of TNFalpha mRNA, while its combination with zVAD. fmk ( but not zVAD. fmk alone) caused a pronounced further increase ( Fig. 6A).	"bFGF	29	33	Protein"	"TNFalpha	68	76	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bFGF"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Conversely, PDGF caused a modest upregulation of TNFalpha mRNA, which was not further increased in the presence of zVAD. fmk ( Fig. 6A), demonstrating that activation of necroptosis is specifically accompanied by a marked increase in autocrine TNFalpha synthesis.	"TNFalpha	49	57	Protein"	"TNFalpha	244	252	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 244, ""end_span"": 252, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Further analysis suggested that both Akt and mTORC1 contribute to the upregulation of TNFalpha mRNA during necroptosis as both small - molecule inhibition and siRNA knockdown of Akt and mTOR reduced TNFalpha mRNA levels in necroptotic cells ( Fig. 6B, C, D).	"TNFalpha	86	94	Protein"	"TNFalpha	199	207	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 199, ""end_span"": 207, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Importantly, inhibition of Akt only inhibited the delayed, but not the early, increase in bFGF / zVAD. fmk induced JNK and c - Jun phosphorylation ( Fig. S6F).	"bFGF	90	94	Protein"	"c - Jun	123	130	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bFGF"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""c - Jun"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Knockdown of mTOR, rapamycin and the p70S6K inhibitor PF - 4708671 also attenuated the necroptosis - associated increase in JNK and c - Jun phosphorylation ( Fig. 6F, S6E, G, Fig. S5D).	"p70S6K	37	43	Protein"	"c - Jun	132	139	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""p70S6K"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""c - Jun"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Overall, these data suggested that the Akt - mTORC1 - S6K axis, acting downstream from RIP1 kinase, is required for the increase in JNK activity during necroptosis in L929 cells.	"S6K	54	57	Protein"	"RIP1	87	91	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""S6K"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RIP1"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In the membrane, Akt is phosphorylated on Thr308 and Ser473 by 3 - phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase - 1 ( PDK1) and mTORC2 ( or DNA - PK), respectively [ 35].	"3 - phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase - 1	63	112	Protein"	"PDK1	115	119	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""3 - phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase - 1"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PDK1"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Likewise, siRNA knockdown of PDK1 protected cells from death and inhibited Akt Thr308 phosphorylation ( Fig. S7E, F) Therefore, PI3K and PDK1 activity is still required for non - canonical Akt activation during necroptosis.	"PDK1	29	33	Protein"	"PDK1	137	141	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PDK1"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PDK1"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Constitutively active Akt1 ( Myr - Akt) was generated as previously described [ 37] by the addition of a myristoylation signal which provides constitutive localization to the plasma membrane and by the deletion of the auto - inhibitory PH domain ( Fig. 7A) resulting in an Akt that is active under serum free.	"Akt1	22	26	Protein"	"Myr - Akt	29	38	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Akt1"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Myr - Akt"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Under serum free conditions Myr - Akt, but not the K179M mutant, fully restored zVAD. fmk - induced necroptosis ( Fig. 7A, B).	"Myr - Akt	28	37	Protein"	"K179M	51	56	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Myr - Akt"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""K179M"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Myr - Akt also allowed other zVAD. fmk - dependent events, including activation of JNK and c - Jun phosphorylation ( Fig. 7C) and upregulation of TNFalpha mRNA ( Fig. 7D) to occur under serum free conditions, confirming an important role for Akt at the apex of necroptotic signaling.

RIP1 kinase was still able to regulate Akt activation during necroptosis, suggesting that growth factors and RIP1 kinase provide two independent inputs required for Akt changes during necroptosis.	"RIP1	0	4	Protein"	"RIP1	109	113	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RIP1"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RIP1"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Phosphorylation of many previously described Akt substrates was increased upon the expression of Myr - Akt, but not the K179M mutant, confirming that these molecules are Akt substrates in L929 cells ( Fig. 7C).	"Myr - Akt	97	106	Protein"	"K179M	120	125	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Myr - Akt"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""K179M"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Under serum free conditions all zVAD. fmk - induced downstream events ( cell death, JNK activation, TNFalpha production) were dependent on the over expressed Myr - Akt.	"TNFalpha	100	108	Protein"	"Myr - Akt	158	167	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Myr - Akt"", ""start_span"": 158, ""end_span"": 167, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As expected, the S473D mutant, which was phosphorylated on Thr308 after the addition of zVAD, displayed only slightly reduced activity, while S473A was significantly less active in all aspects of necroptosis.	"S473D mutant	17	29	Protein"	"S473A	142	147	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""S473D mutant"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""S473A"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 147, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
S473A was unable to be efficiently phosphorylated on Thr308 possibly due to the inability of the Ala mutated 473 site to be phosphorylated and provide a docking site for PDK1 to phosphorylate Thr308 [ 39].	"S473A	0	5	Protein"	"PDK1	170	174	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""S473A"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PDK1"", ""start_span"": 170, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Strikingly, both Ala and Asp mutants of Thr308 were significantly less active in promoting cell death, phosphorylation of JNK and c - Jun, and TNFalpha mRNA.	"c - Jun	130	137	Protein"	"TNFalpha	143	151	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""c - Jun"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore, TNFalpha mRNA levels were increased in each of these cell types during necroptosis and efficiently inhibited by both RIP1 and Akt inhibitors ( Fig. 8A, C, E).	"TNFalpha	13	21	Protein"	"RIP1	130	134	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RIP1"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These results indicate that regulation of autocrine TNFalpha synthesis and necroptosis - associated inflammatory signaling may be a more important function of Akt pathway activation by RIP1 kinase in multiple cell types compared to its contribution to cell death.	"TNFalpha	52	60	Protein"	"RIP1	185	189	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RIP1"", ""start_span"": 185, ""end_span"": 189, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Expression of catalytically active Akt ( Myr - Akt) in these cells restored TNFalpha mRNA production in response to TNFalpha and zVAD. fmk ( Fig. 8G) without re - establishing cell death ( Fig. S9D).

Second, our data suggested that Akt activation provides a pivotal link connecting RIP1 kinase to known downstream signaling and execution events in necroptotic L929 cells, namely, JNK activation and autocrine TNFalpha synthesis, a critical event in necroptosis in L929 cells [ 15].

It has been published that SP600125 is a somewhat non - specific inhibitor that may inhibit the p110delta subunit of PI3K [ 41] and PDK1 [ 42].

Therefore, to examine the role of JNK, we switched to a more specific JNK inhibitor, JNK inhibitor VIII [ 43], and siRNAs against JNK1 and JNK2 ( Fig. S10B - G).	"JNK1	130	134	Protein"	"JNK2	139	143	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""JNK1"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""JNK2"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, autocrine TNFalpha production, dependent on c - Jun, may create a feedback loop that contributes to the delayed activation of Akt.

It is also important to note that we observed an overall increase in the protein level of c - Jun after treatment of L929 cells with zVAD. fmk or TNFalpha, which was both Akt and mTOR - dependent ( Fig. 6E, F).	"c - Jun	90	97	Protein"	"TNFalpha	146	154	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""c - Jun"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These new data led us to an unexpected, but important conclusion that c - Jun is critical for necroptosis, while JNK activity may serve as a useful marker of pathway activation, but may be either redundant ( e. g. phosphorylation of c - Jun on a site other than Ser63 may occur [ 44]) or dispensable functionally.

This provides a link connecting RIP1 kinase to downstream signaling and execution events during necroptosis in L929 cells, including JNK activation, autocrine TNFalpha synthesis and eventual cell death.

At the same time, expression of Myr - Akt is not sufficient for the induction of necroptosis or efficient activation of JNK and TNFalpha synthesis.

Another possibility is that the increase in Thr308 results from RIP1 kinase targeting PDK1, Akt or scaffolding factors that bring these two kinases together.

Given the activation of JNK by TNFalpha and the importance of mTORC1 - dependent translational control in necroptosis, one possibility is that mTORC1 contributes to the translation of TNFalpha and forms a positive feed forward loop with JNK.

Importantly, in mouse lung fibroblasts, FADD - deficient Jurkat cells, and macrophages, Akt signaling contributed more prominently to an increase in TNFalpha synthesis, rather than cell death per se, unlike its role in L929 cells.

A recent study [ 15] has demonstrated that, in addition to its role in necroptosis, RIP1 plays an important role in mediating the production of TNFalpha.

Our results highlight an important notion that inflammation not only passively accompanies necroptosis in a variety of cellular systems by the virtue of rapid loss of plasma membrane integrity characteristic for necrotic cell death, but also that it is an intrinsic and regulated component of necroptosis due to the specific activation of TNFalpha synthesis by RIP1 / Akt kinases.

Along these lines, another recent paper by Duprez et al. has shown that RIP1 and RIP3 mediate the cellular damage introduced by TNF - induced SIRS [ 6].

The role of RIP1 kinase in acute and chronic inflammatory diseases warrants further investigation, as efficient and specific RIP1 kinase inhibitors may offer therapeutic benefit for treating these conditions.

Because the human and mouse cebpb 3 ' untranslated regions are not identical, these species - specific shRNAs cannot knockdown expression of endogenous C / EBP - beta when used on cells of the other species; therefore we used the human CEBPB shRNA as a control in these experiments as in [ 38].

Of note, there are previous reports of combinatorial interactions between C / EBP - beta and CRE binding proteins ( CREB) and AP - 1 [ 63], and C / EBP - beta has been reported to physically interact with AP - 1, and NF - kappaB to promote gene expression of inflammatory mediators [ 63]; [ 66].

C / EBP - beta, like SerpinB2, plays an important role in inflammation, as it is upregulated by LPS and a host of other inflammatory cytokines [ 59]; [ 62].

Furthermore, C / EBP - beta - null mice are susceptible to bacterial infection [ 69]; [ 70] and SerpinB2 has been demonstrated to protect from bacterial and viral - induced cell death [ 14] - [ 16]; [ 25].

Since C / EBP - beta S64 is constitutively phosphorylated in both RAW264. 7 cells and MEFs [ 73], it is likely that dephosphorylation at this site may be a critical event during LPS - induced transcription of SerpinB2 to increase its promoter activity.
