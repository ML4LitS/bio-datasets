We observed no genetic alterations in the IRF - 4 promoter, which can account for the lack of IRF - 4 expression: The detected base pair changes at position - 1081 ( T to C substitution), at position - 1068 ( A to C substitution) and at position - 116 ( A to C substitution) are unlikely responsible for absent IRF - 4 - expression since the first two mutations were found both in IRF - 4 - positive and - negative cells whereas the latter change was not detected consistently in all IRF - 4 - negative or - positive cells and may thus be a polymorphism.

Transfection of HEK 293T cells with an NF - kappaB luciferase reporter vector in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of a Foxp3 expression vector or a control vector ( enhanced green fluorescent protein [ EGFP]) was performed, and cells were harvested after 24 h to assay for luciferase activity and Foxp3 mRNA expression.

Transactivation of the HTLV - I LTR was stimulated about 55 - fold by overexpression of Tax ( Figure 4B), while transfection of Foxp3 suppressed Tax - dependent HTLV - I LTR activation, although HTLV - I LTR activation in the presence or absence of Tax is independent of NF - kappaB or NF - AT ( another transcriptional activator known to interact with Foxp3).

To determine whether Foxp3 inhibited the transactivation functions of Tax by directly associating with this viral protein, we generated an expression vector in which HTLV - I Tax was fused in - frame to the carboxyl terminus of the Gal4 DNA - binding domain ( Gal4 - BD).

Although Foxp3 could down - regulate Tax - dependent transactivation of the HTLV - I LTR ( Figure 4B) and inhibit Tax expression from an infectious molecular clone ( Figure 5), Foxp3 failed to modulate Tax function in the absence of the viral promoter ( Figure 4D).

As shown in Figure 6D, activation of a Gal4 - responsive reporter vector by Gal4 - BD - CREB - 1 was down - regulated by Foxp3 compared to control vector ( EGFP), indicating that Foxp3 functions by directly or indirectly interacting with CREB - 1.

pFA - Tax ( encoding a fusion protein consisting of the Gal4 DNA - binding domain fused in - frame to HTLV - I Tax) was constructed by PCR amplification of HTLV - I Tax using pCMV4 - Tax as a template and BamHI / BglII - tagged primers.

Both the membrane proximal and distal cytoplasmic regions of CD40 that bind TRAF6 and TRAFs2 / 3 / 5, respectively, are necessary for GC formation, but either region is sufficient to induce extrafollicular B cell differentiation and restore low affinity antibody production [ 22].

This higher level of proliferation was observed in lymphomas that express both high ( Table 1, LMP1 - L2 and LMP1 - L3) and low ( Table 1, LMP1 - L5) levels of LMP1, suggesting that even small amounts of LMP1 is sufficient to induce dramatic effects in proliferation.

However, considering that Akt activation did not induce FoxO1 degradation in LMP1 transgenic B cells, Akt may not be the sole regulator of FoxO1, and it may be that progression to lymphoma requires modulation of multiple pathways.

Strikingly, Runx3 - / - CD8 + T cells were strongly impaired in their ability to differentiate into effector CTLs, as judged by expression of perforin, granzyme B, and IFN - gamma ( Fig. 3).

Furthermore, Runx3 was required for maximal production of IFN - gamma, but not TNF or IL - 2, by CD8 + T cells restimulated at day 6 ( Fig. 3 C).	"Runx3	13	18	Protein"	"IFN - gamma	58	69	Protein"	"TNF	79	82	Protein"	"IL - 2	86	92	Protein"	"CD8	97	100	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Runx3"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IFN - gamma"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TNF"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 2"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD8"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To test this hypothesis, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP) assays to ask whether Eomes and Runx3 bound regulatory regions of the Prf1, Ifng, and Gzmb genes ( Fig. 3 D).	"Eomes	93	98	Protein"	"Runx3	103	108	Protein"	"Prf1	141	145	Protein"	"Ifng	147	151	Protein"	"Gzmb	157	161	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Eomes"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Runx3"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Prf1"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Ifng"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Gzmb"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In addition, Runx3 - / - T cells showed a compensatory up - regulation of Runx1, which was suppressed upon reconstitution with Runx3, indicating that Runx1 is a target of repression by Runx3.

For TNF and IL - 2, the requirement for Runx3 subsides by day 6 ( Fig. 3 C), possibly because of compensation by Runx1, which is derepressed in Runx3 - / - cells ( Fig. 4 A).

We showed that development of IL - 10 - producing Th1 cells required high T cell receptor ( TCR) ligation, sustained ERK1 and ERK2 MAP kinases phosphorylation, and IL - 12 - induced STAT4 transcription factor activation.

Th2 cell development, with expression of IL - 4, IL - 5, and IL - 13, requires IL - 4, STAT6, and the transcription factor GATA binding protein ( GATA) - 3 ( Glimcher and Murphy, 2000).

Whereas high doses of antigen, with sustained TCR signaling and extracellular - signal regulated ( ERK) mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK) phosphorylation, result in Th1 cells producing IFN - gamma via an IL - 12 - independent mechanism, low doses of antigen, with transient ERK1 and ERK2 activation, favor Th2 responses and IL - 4 secretion ( Constant et al., 1995; Hosken et al., 1995; Jorritsma et al., 2003; Yamane et al., 2005).

To study the differentiation of Th1 cells coproducing IFN - gamma and IL - 10, we cultured purified TCR - transgenic DO11. 10 naive CD4 + T cells with purified DCs as APCs and increasing doses of ovalbumin peptide 323 - 339 ( OVA).

To investigate whether the lack of IL - 10 produced by Th1 cells resulted from inhibition of IL - 10 production by DCs and high antigen dose or alternatively required IL - 12, we cultured naive CD4 + T cells with increasing doses of antigen presented by DC in the presence of IL - 12.

At low doses of antigen, IL - 12 abrogated the development of Th2 cells and induced IFN - gamma expression but only low levels of IL - 10 expression, suggesting that IL - 12 per se was not sufficient to induce significant IL - 10 production in Th1 cells ( Figure 1A).	"IL - 12	25	32	Protein"	"IFN - gamma	84	95	Protein"	"IL - 10	130	137	Protein"	"IL - 12	166	173	Protein"	"IL - 10	222	229	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IFN - gamma"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 166, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 222, ""end_span"": 229, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Because the presence of IL - 12 reduced the proliferation of CD4 + T cells at both high and low antigen doses ( Table S1), and only the former showed IL - 10 production, the development of high IL - 10 - producing cells is most likely not related to limited IL - 2.

Naive CD4 + T cells from DO11. 10 / recombination - activating gene 1 ( Rag1) - deficient animals, cultured with high doses of antigen in the presence of IL - 12, also resulted in IL - 10 expression by Th1 cells, showing that this expression was not dependent on the presence of effector or memory T cells or Treg cells ( Figure S2).

Because IL - 10 expression is associated with an IL - 4 - induced Th2 cell phenotype, we investigated whether the differentiation of the IL - 10 - producing Th1 cells depended on signaling through the IL - 4 receptor via STAT6 activation ( Glimcher and Murphy, 2000; Murphy et al., 2000).

The secretion of IL - 10 as induced by high antigen dose, and IL - 12 was not affected by an absence of IFN - gamma ( Figure 2D), showing that the expression of IL - 10 by Th1 cells is independent of IFN - gamma.

We also tested for any potential role of IL - 4 in the development of Th1 cells producing IL - 10 by culturing DO11. 10 or DO11. 10 IL - 4 - deficient naive CD4 + T cells with IL - 12 and increasing doses of antigen.

Although the apparent peak and amount of ERK1 and ERK2 activation varied slightly between experiments, a consistent finding was that high antigen dose differentiated Th1 cells always showed enhanced and prolonged ERK1 and ERK2 activation in the presence of IL - 12, regardless of whether they were restimulated with high or low antigen dose ( Figure 5B).

We showed that ERK1 and ERK2 activation is a common pathway required for induction of IL - 10 in different Th cell subsets because IL - 10 production by both Th2 and Th17 cells was markedly inhibited in the presence of the MEK inhibitor ( PD184352) ( Figure 5D and Figure S5B).

In Th17 cells that expressed IL - 17a as well as IL - 10 mRNA ( Figure 6C), T - bet and GATA - 3 mRNA were undetectable ( data not shown), whereas that of ROR - gammat was high ( Figure 6C) ( Ivanov et al., 2007).

Here, we showed that Th1 cells required high - antigen - dose - induced ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation and IL - 12 - induced STAT - 4 activation to produce IL - 10.

Similarly, the immune response to a clinical isolate of L. major, which produces heavily infected nonhealing lesions, was found to be regulated by IL - 10 derived from Foxp3 - Th1 cells that coproduce IL - 10 and IFN - gamma ( Anderson et al., 2007), and the immune response during T. gondii infection was found also to be regulated by Foxp3 - Th1 cells ( Jankovic et al., 2007).

We now also reported that CD4 + T cells cultured with high antigen dose and IL - 12 differentiate into canonical Th1 effector cells, which, in addition to expressing large amounts of IFN - gamma and IL - 10, lose their IL - 2 expression as described before in certain chronic infection models ( Sallusto et al., 2004).

Members of the TNF receptor - associated factor ( TRAF) family, including TRAF1, TRAF2, TRAF3, and TRAF6, appear to be particularly important for the initiation and regulation of CD40 signaling [ 4].

We recently demonstrated that HOIL - 1L interacting protein ( HOIP), a ubiquitin ligase that can catalyze the assembly of linear polyubiquitin chains [ 5], is recruited to CD40 in a TRAF2 - dependent manner following engagement of CD40 by agonistic antibody [ 6].

We also found that the recruitment of HOIP to CD40 was TRAF2 - dependent and that overexpression of a truncated HOIP mutant partially inhibited CD40 - mediated NF - kappaB activation.

To enable us to confirm that any signaling or functional defects observed in HOIP - deficient cells were due to disruption of the Rnf31 gene, both HOIP - deficient cell lines were transduced with a retrovirus encoding FLAG - tagged wild - type HOIP, thus restoring HOIP protein expression ( Fig. 1B).

In contrast, upregulation of CD80 was restored in HOIP - reconstituted cells, confirming that the defect in CD80 upregulation in the HOIP - deficient cells was due to the disruption of Rnf31.

To determine whether HOIP is required in the initiation of the class switching process, the relevant B cell lines were stimulated through CD40 in the presence of IL - 4 and tested for production of germline epsilon ( GLepsilon) transcripts ( Fig. 3).

In contrast, IKKalpha / beta and IKKgamma were not detectable in CD40 immunoprecipitates recovered from HOIP - deficient cells ( Fig. 5B, C).

At the molecular level, our data indicate that HOIP functions downstream of TRAF2 in the CD40 signaling pathway and that HOIP has a key role in promoting the recruitment of the IKK complex to CD40.

While our previous work indicated a potentially important link between TRAF2 and HOIP in CD40 signaling, the signals and functions tested here are dependent upon TRAF6 as well as TRAF2.

In previous experiments with TRAF - deficient A20. 2J cells, we found that the activation of NF - kappaB by CD40 could be mediated by either TRAF2 or TRAF6, while activation of JNK by CD40 was largely dependent on TRAF6 alone [ 8].

HOIP deficiency compromises the CD40 - mediated activation of both NF - kappaB and JNK, indicating that signals mediated by both TRAF2 and TRAF6 likely pass through HOIP.

Our previous work also demonstrated that the CD40 - mediated activation of NF - kappaB and JNK, while TRAF6 - dependent, was not compromised by the disruption of the binding site for TRAF6 in the cytoplasmic domain of CD40 or deletion of the receptor binding domain ( the TRAF - C domain) in TRAF6 [ 8].
