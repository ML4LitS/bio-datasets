The calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporin A and FK506 also downregulated the IL - 17 secretion as well as the mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK) p38 inhibitor SB203580 did, whereas rapamycin and PD98059 had no effect on IL - 17 levels ( Fig. 3).

In contrast, the AP - 1 pathway was not activated by stimulation with anti - CD3 plus anti - CD28 ( data not shown), demonstrating that NF - kappaB is the main intracellular signaling pathway in IL - 17 production by activated PBMC from patients with RA.

However, there are few data available on the agents that stimulate IL - 17 production in RA, although the highest level of IL - 17 production can be achieved by anti - CD3 / anti - CD28 stimulation in healthy individuals [ 25].

In our experiments, PHA as mitogens, as well as anti - CD3 / anti - CD28 for signaling through the T cell receptor, increased IL - 17 production from RA PBMC in a dose - dependent manner.

Our studies demonstrated that IL - 15 and MCP - 1 as well as TCR ligation significantly increased the production of IL - 17 in RA PBMC.

Adding IL - 15 or MCP - 1 to TCR ligation augmented IL - 17 production more markedly.

In contrast, IL - 1 and TNF - alpha, which are known to have proinflammatory properties and to be increased in RA joints, did not affect IL - 17 production.

Our data were consistent with a recent report that IL - 15 triggered in vitro IL - 17 production in PBMC, but TNF - alpha did not do so [ 13].

In myocytes, IkappaB kinase - beta is activated by p38 [ 32], and the activated p38 can stimulate NF - kappaB by a mechanism involving histone acetylase p300 / CREB - binding protein [ 33].

In view of the fact that NF - kappaB was also activated by anti - CD3 / anti - CD28, IL - 15 or mitogens in our experiments, it is most likely that the NF - kappaB pathway is also actively involved in the induction of IL - 17 in RA PBMC.

Our data clearly demonstrated that PI3K / Akt and resultant NF - kappaB activation could be an important arbitrator of the upregulation of IL - 17 in RA, on the basis of our experiments showing simultaneous blocking of NF - kappaB binding activity in the IL - 17 promoter by PDTC and LY294002.

The normal expression of Sox6 in wild - type fetal liver and the ectopic expression of epsilony in p100H homozygous fetal liver demonstrate that Sox6 functions in definitive erythropoiesis.

The present study shows that Sox6 is required for silencing of epsilony globin in definitive erythropoiesis and suggests a role for Sox6 in erythroid cell maturation.

Among the HMG box proteins distantly related to Sry ( the first member identified of the Sox transcription factor family) that similarly bind to the minor groove and bend DNA, but without sequence specificity, are the ubiquitously expressed HMG1 and HMG2 proteins [ 17].

In the absence of Sox6, epsilony globin is ectopically expressed in the fetal liver, demonstrating that Sox6 functions in definitive erythropoiesis.

Interestingly, the expression levels of the other two embryonic globin genes ( zeta and betah1) are also higher in p100H homozygous mice, compared with WT mice, but to a much lesser extent than seen for epsilony globin at 18. 5 dpc ( Figure 1).

We note that the level of epsilony expression in the livers of 15. 5 dpc and 18. 5 dpc homozygous mutant mice is statistically equivalent to the level of betamaj / min expression in the livers of 15. 5 dpc and 18. 5 dpc homozygous WT mice.

We generated an epsilony promoter reporter construct ( E - Luc) by fusing a micro - LCR ( muLCR) element ( 2. 5 kb) [ 31] to the epsilony proximal promoter ( 2. 2 kb), followed by the luciferase reporter gene, as shown in Figure 2A ( detailed in Materials and Methods).

Sox6 has been shown to act as a repressor and to interact with a widely expressed co - repressor, CtBP2, on the fgf - 3 promoter [ 5].

Deletion analysis of the epsilony promoter, as shown in Figure 2C, defined a region ( - 63 to - 37) within the epsilony proximal promoter that is critical for Sox6 repression.

Sox6 might repress the epsilony promoter, either through direct physical contact with the promoter or by regulating intermediates affecting the epsilony promoter.

Moreover, both c - Myc and Sox6 antibodies supershift the band, indicating that the binding is Sox6 - specific.

To rule out the possibility that the c - Myc tag itself binds to the probe, an HA - tagged Sox6 was used in another EMSA that confirmed these results ( Figure 3C).

The above data ( Figures 3 and 4) clearly indicate that Sox6 acts as a repressor of the epsilony gene by directly binding to the epsilony promoter, probably as a dimer.

The Persistent Expression of epsilony Globin in Sox6 - Deficient Mice Is Due to a Defect in the epsilony - Gene - Silencing Mechanism in Definitive Erythroid Cells	"epsilony Globin	29	44	Protein"	"Sox6	48	52	Protein"	"epsilony	96	104	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""epsilony Globin"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Sox6"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""epsilony"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To determine whether the persistent expression of epsilony globin is due to residual primitive erythrocytes or is due to ectopic expression of epsilony globin in definitive erythrocytes, we examined the spatial pattern of epsilony globin transcripts in mouse embryos by in situ hybridization ( Figure 5).	"epsilony globin	50	65	Protein"	"epsilony globin	143	158	Protein"	"epsilony globin	222	237	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""epsilony globin"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""epsilony globin"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""epsilony globin"", ""start_span"": 222, ""end_span"": 237, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These data demonstrate that the persistent high levels of epsilony are due to ectopic expression in the definitive erythroid cells that mature in the fetal liver, suggesting that there is an intrinsic defect of the epsilony silencing mechanism in Sox6 - null mice.

The observation that Sox6 - deficient mice ectopically express epsilony globin in liver, where definitive erythroid cells mature, suggests that Sox6 is an important regulator in definitive erythropoiesis.

Sox6 expression is temporally and spatially coincident with definitive ( but not primitive) erythropoiesis ( Figure 6), and Sox6 represses epsilony globin expression both in vivo ( Figure 1) and in vitro ( Figure 2).

Like epsilony, levels of zeta and betah1 are dramatically higher in mutant mice at 15. 5 dpc.

At this point in development, the levels of zeta and betah1 RNA were undetectable both in mutant and WT; however, adult beta - like globin RNA levels were moderately elevated in the mutant RNA compared with WT ( unpublished data), similar to what we observe at 18. 5 dpc ( Figure 1).

These findings suggest that Sox6 continues to function postnatally to silence epsilony globin expression and has a unique function in the regulation of epsilony - globin.

Because murine Sox6 and its human counterpart are 94% identical at the amino acid level [ 48], it is possible that human Sox6 may also be important in human epsilon globin silencing.

Thus, elucidation of the Sox6 repression mechanism and identification of other components of the Sox6 - containing complex may further our understanding of epsilon globin regulation and potentially reveal additional molecular targets for the treatment of sickle cell anemia and beta thalassemias.

A 2. 2 - kb fragment upstream of the epsilony globin initiation codon ( ATG) was used, because it has been shown that all sequences required for epsilon gene silencing are located within a 3. 7 - kb EcoRI fragment containing about 2 kb of sequence upstream of the epsilon globin gene cap site [ 50].

A 2. 5 - kb SstI / XhoI fragment of muLCRbeta 9. 3 ( micro LCR; [ 31]) was then inserted upstream of the epsilony promoter in the above pGL3 Basic plasmid, resulting in a reporter construct in which luciferase expression is driven by the epsilony promoter.

beta - ( 1 - > 3) - D - glucan modulates DNA binding of nuclear factors kappaB, AT and IL - 6 leading to an anti - inflammatory shift of the IL - 1beta / IL - 1 receptor antagonist ratio	"IL - 6	87	93	Protein"	"IL - 1beta	141	151	Protein"	"IL - 1 receptor antagonist	154	180	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 6"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 1beta"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 1 receptor antagonist"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 180, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
An increase in IL - 1receptor antagonist ( RA) production ( peak at 24 h: 12000 pg / ml) by glucan phosphate - treated cells positively correlated with IL - 8 levels.

Further, glucan phosphate modulated the TSST - 1 - induced inflammatory response via reduction of IL - 1beta and IL - 6.

As a consequence, glucan phosphate shifted the TSST - 1 - induced IL - 1beta / IL - 1RA ratio towards an anti - inflammatory phenotype.

Subsequently, glucan phosphate decreased the TSST - 1 - induced, IL - 1 - dependent production of IL - 2.

Similarly, it has been shown that beta - 1 to 3 - D - glucans activate NFkappaB in a human monocyte - like cell line [ 15] and in human polymorphonuclear neutrophils ( PMN), in the latter case without secretion of pro - inflammatory cytokines ( IL - 1, IL - 6, TNFalpha) [ 16].

A supershift, conducted for an NFkappaB consensus site from the IL - 8 promoter, demonstrated a GP - induced predominant binding of NFkappaB p65 and to a lesser degree of p50 ( Fig. 1A).

Accordingly, an immunoblot of nuclear extracts from GP - treated PBMC showed a strong binding of NFkappaB p65 and a weaker reaction of p50, whereas p52 was negative ( Fig. 2).

An immunoblot for two NFAT subunits demonstrated a GP - induced binding of NFATc2 and to a lesser degree of NFATc1 ( Fig. 2).

When combined with TSST - 1 or GP / TSST - 1 calc., GP seemed to exert a synergistic effect on TNFalpha secretion after 36 h ( n = 3; p < 0. 05), but overall an enhancement of only 10% was observed ( p > 0. 05; data not shown in detail).

There were also no significant differences between medium control, LPS, TSST - 1, GP, GP + LPS, GP / LPS calc. and GP + TSST - 1 or GP / TSST - 1 calc. over 48 h ( data not shown).	"TSST - 1	72	80	Protein"	"TSST - 1	120	128	Protein"	"TSST - 1	137	145	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TSST - 1"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TSST - 1"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TSST - 1"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
GP modulated the TSST - 1 - induced IL - 1beta / IL - 1RA ratio towards an anti - inflammatory phenotype	"TSST - 1	17	25	Protein"	"IL - 1beta	36	46	Protein"	"IL - 1RA	49	57	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TSST - 1"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 1beta"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 1RA"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
vs. GP + TSST - 1, we observed a pronounced anti - inflammatory action of GP, as demonstrated by an about 10 - 100 fold reduced ratio at 18 h and 24 h of incubation, i. e. a higher production of IL - 1RA than of IL - 1beta ( n = 3; both p < 0. 05; Fig. 6).

In addition, our EMSA / supershift and immunoblotting results demonstrated a GP - mediated predominant binding of NFkappaB p65 and to a lesser extent of p50 to a kappaB consensus site of the IL - 8 promoter ( Figs. 1A, 2).	"p65	123	126	Protein"	"p50	153	156	Protein"	"IL - 8	191	197	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p50"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 8"", ""start_span"": 191, ""end_span"": 197, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Unlike LPS or TSST - 1, we found that GP did not induce IL - 1beta, but it strongly induced IL - 1RA, suggesting an immediate anti - inflammatory potential of GP.	"TSST - 1	14	22	Protein"	"IL - 1beta	56	66	Protein"	"IL - 1RA	92	100	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TSST - 1"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 1beta"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 1RA"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Of the four examined NFkappaB sites from the IL - 1RA promoter, mostly the TSST - 1 - and LPS - induced binding to the NFkappaB3 and the TSST - 1 - induced binding to the new NFkappaB consensus site seemed to be increased by GP.	"IL - 1RA	45	53	Protein"	"TSST - 1	75	83	Protein"	"TSST - 1	137	145	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 1RA"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TSST - 1"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TSST - 1"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
So, while we observed a GP - mediated down - regulation of the LPS - and the TSST - 1 - induced NFkappaB binding to sites of the TNFalpha promoter, there was an up - regulation to NFkappaB3 and NFkappaB consensus sites of the IL - 1RA promoter.	"TSST - 1	77	85	Protein"	"TNFalpha	129	137	Protein"	"IL - 1RA	226	234	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TSST - 1"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 1RA"", ""start_span"": 226, ""end_span"": 234, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The GP - modulated increase in TSST - 1 - induced binding to the new NFkappaB3 and NFkappaB consensus site, the NFIL - 6 site [ 32] as well as to the novel NFATP2 / 3 site may explain the synergistic up - regulation of the TSST - 1 - induced IL - 1RA production.

We think that this GP - modulated activation of transcription was reflected by the decrease of the IL - 1beta / IL - 1RA ratio following GP + TSST - 1 ( Fig. 6).	"IL - 1beta	99	109	Protein"	"IL - 1RA	112	120	Protein"	"TSST - 1	142	150	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 1beta"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 1RA"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TSST - 1"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In this context, it has been postulated that in vitro a 100fold excess of IL - 1RA over IL - 1beta might control the biological effects of IL - 1 [ 46, 47].	"IL - 1RA	74	82	Protein"	"IL - 1beta	88	98	Protein"	"IL - 1	139	145	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 1RA"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 1beta"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 1"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Indeed, GP reduced the TSST - 1 - induced, IL - 1 - dependent IL - 2 production of murine EL - 4 cells ( data not shown in detail).	"TSST - 1	23	31	Protein"	"IL - 1	43	49	Protein"	"IL - 2	62	68	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TSST - 1"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 1"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 2"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In summary, our data demonstrated that in vitro glucan phosphate induced a transcription factor binding and a subsequent cytokine profile different from LPS and also from TSST - 1 and, moreover, switched a pro - inflammatory TSST - 1 - induced response to an IL - 1RA - mediated anti - inflammatory reaction.

Mutations in the P2 site of the IFNgamma promoter [ 29] and in the kappa consensus sequence of the TNFalpha promoter [ 55] have been reported to interfere with sequences, which seem to be crucial for the binding of NFAT and NFkappaB proteins, respectively.

NF - kappaB activation by receptor activator of NF - kappaB ( RANK), a TNF receptor family member, is important for osteoclastogenesis, and defects in proper RANK - NF - kappaB signalling are likely to be involved in RA pathology and other diseases associated with bone loss [ 7].

CD40 is another TNF receptor family member that is functionally expressed on a variety of cell types, including smooth muscle fibroblasts from normal and RA patients and RA synovial cells, B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, and can be upregulated by proinflammatory cytokines including TNF [ 10].

Binding of the CD40 ligand ( CD154), which is transiently expressed on the surface of activated CD4 + T cells, triggers NF - kappaB activation resulting in fibroblast proliferation and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which contributes to joint destruction.

Myeloid - related protein 8 and myeloid - related protein 14, damage - associated molecular pattern molecules belonging to the S100 family of calcium - binding proteins, are also abundantly present in RA synovial fluid, and have been suggested to be involved in TLR4 - induced chronic inflammation in RA [ 17, 18].

MyD88 in turn recruits members of the IL - 1R - associated kinase ( IRAK) family and TRAF6, leading to oligomerisation and selfubiquitination of TRAF6 [ 24].

All this contributes to releasing NIK from its constitutive degradation, resulting in NIK accumulation and IKK1 phosphorylation [ 28, 29] ( Figure 2).

It should be mentioned that CD40, lymphotoxin beta receptor and RANK mediate the activation of both canonical and noncanonical NF - kappaB signalling pathways.

Several other proteins involved in the negative regulation of NF - kappaB - dependent inflammatory responses, such as MyD88s, IRAK - M, and TOLLIP, have been described ( reviewed in [ 33]).

Interestingly, a recent study has demonstrated that IKK1 phosphorylates NIK in negative feedback regulation of the noncanonical NF - kappaB pathway [ 36], supporting the idea that IKK1 plays important roles in terminating both canonical and noncanonical NF - kappaB pathways with possible implications for chronic inflammatory diseases like RA.

We recently showed that mice specifically lacking A20 in intestinal epithelial cells exhibit increased susceptibility to experimental colitis due to the hypersensitivity of their intestinal epithelial cells to TNF - induced apoptosis, confirming A20 as a major antiapoptotic protein in the intestinal epithelium [ 47].

Many of these are also targeted by A20 and it is still not clear why the cell needs A20 as well as CYLD to control NF - kappaB activation.

These findings suggest that CYLD - mediated inhibi - tion of RANK - induced NF - kappaB signalling plays a key role in the negative regulation of osteoclastogenesis and indicate CYLD as a potential genetic factor involved in the pathology of bone disorders such as RA.

TAK1 then phosphorylates and activates IKK2, which in turn phosphorylates IkappaBalpha, triggering its K48 - linked ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.

As a result, TRAF3 is degraded and NIK is stabilised, resulting in increased NIK levels in the cell.

This is followed by K48 - linked polyubiquitination and partial proteasomal degradation of p100 to p52, which forms a heterodimer with RelB to activate transcription.

On the other hand, deubiquitinating enzymes ( DUBs), such as DUBA [ 28], CYLD [ 29], [ 30] and OTUB1 / 2 [ 31] have been shown to negatively regulate RLR signaling by specifically removing K63 - linked polyubiquitin chains from several signaling molecules.

Both catalytic and noncatalytic mechanisms were previously shown to be involved in the negative regulation of proinflammatory signaling by A20 in response to multiple receptors such as TNF receptor I [ 37] - [ 39], TLR4 [ 40], and IL - 1R [ 41].

In contrast to its well established function in the regulation of proinflammatory responses, the role of A20 in the regulation of antiviral immune responses is less well described and limited to a number of in vitro studies using overexpression or silencing in specific cell lines, indicating that A20 may regulate RIG - I - and TLR3 - induced signaling to NF - kappaB and IRF - 3 [ 49] - [ 52].

RIG - I signaling induces the activation of NF - kappaB, IRF3 and IRF7 transcription factors, which promote the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs that restrict further viral propagation.

Similar to its inhibitory effect on NF - kappaB and IRF3 activation, A20 also prevented RIG - I - induced IRF7 activation ( figure 1A, right graph).

These results demonstrate the potential of A20 to inhibit RIG - I - induced NF - kappaB and IRF3 / 7 activation.

To stimulate the RIG - I receptor, we transfected A20myel - KO BMDM and wild type control cells with minimal amounts of low molecular weight ( LMW) poly ( I: C), which is known to preferentially bind and activate RIG - I rather than MDA5 [ 57].

IRF3 is known to be activated upon phosphorylation of a series of carboxyl terminal serine residues by the IKK - like kinases TBK1 and IKKepsilon [ 58], leading to its dimerization and subsequent translocation to the nucleus [ 59].

Levels of KC and MIP - 2 chemokines, as well as IL - 6 were significantly higher at day 7 p. i. in BAL from IAV infected A20myel - KO mice compared to IAV infected wild type mice ( figure 3C).

Consistent with the higher KC and MIP - 2 levels in A20myel - KO mice, the number of neutrophils ( CD11b + Ly6C + Ly6G + F4 / 80 -) that were recruited in the bronchoalveolar spaces upon IAV infection was clearly higher throughout infection in A20myel - KO mice compared to control animals ( figure 3D).

Also levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL - 6, TNF and IL - 1beta, which are often associated with immunopathogenesis in humans [ 64], were increased in the lungs of A20myel - KO mice compared to control animals ( figure 4C and figure S3A).

Multiple other deubiquitinating enzymes ( DUBs), such as DUBA [ 28], CYLD [ 29], [ 30], OTUB1 / 2 [ 31], and A20 [ 49] - [ 52] have been shown to negatively regulate RIG - I signaling to NF - kappaB and IRF - 3, implicating possible redundancy.

Granzyme B ( GrB) and IFNgamma expressing CD8 + T cells were determined by treating the mice intranasally with 50 microg Brefeldin A ( Sigma) as previously described [ 86].

Furthermore, TNF - alpha induces macrophage inflammatory protein - 2 ( MIP - 2) that recruits neutrophils under pathological conditions, including SE [ 14, 20].

TNF receptor expressions were also up - regulated in astrocytes ( TNFp55R and TNFp75R) and endothelial cells ( TNFp75R).	"TNFp55R	66	73	Protein"	"TNFp75R	78	85	Protein"	"TNFp75R	111	118	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNFp55R"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TNFp75R"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TNFp75R"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore, sTNFp55R infusion effectively inhibited p65 - Ser276 and p65 - Ser311phosphorylation in astrocytes following SE.	"sTNFp55R	13	21	Protein"	"p65	53	56	Protein"	"p65	70	73	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""sTNFp55R"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, it is likely that enhanced p65 - Ser276 and p65 - Ser311 phosphorylation may be involved in TNF - alpha - mediated BBB disruption.

However, sTNFp55R infusion could not prevent p65 - Ser529 and p65 - Ser536 phosphorylations from SE insults.

sTNFp55R infusion effectively reduces p65 - Thr435 and preserves SMI - 71 expression in GLUT - 1 - positive endothelial cells ( arrows).

The mRNA and protein levels of TNF - alpha, IL - 1beta, IL - 6, and MMP9 were also evaluated.

The present study demonstrated that scratch injury induced the upregulation of NF - kappaB DNA binding activity and overexpression of TNF - alpha, IL - 1beta, IL - 6, and MMP9 in cultured astrocytes.

As a transcript factor, NF - kappaB binds with DNA once it was activated and induces transcription of MMP9 and a battery of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF - alpha, IL - 1beta, and IL - 6, in brain tissues after TBI [ 3, 10, 11].

Here, our results revealed that overexpression of TNF - alpha, IL - 1beta, IL - 6, and MMP9 after scratch injury was more aggravated in cultured Nrf2 knockout astrocytes than in wildtype astrocyetes for the first time, and overexpression of these proinflammatory mediators led to more astrocytes deaths.

Our results demonstrated the upregulated expression of TNF - alpha, IL - 1beta, IL - 6, and MMP9 in Nrf2 knockout astrocytes after scratch injury for the first time.

In conclusion, depletion of Nrf2 induced the activation of NF - kappaB and the expression of TNF - alpha, IL - 1beta, IL - 6, and MMP9 resulting in more cell deaths in astrocytes after scratch injury.

Given that NFAT5 has previously been shown to be transcriptionally activated by the MAP kinase p38, which is downstream of MyD88 signaling, [ 32], we speculated that NFAT5 may also be involved in MTb - induced activation of HIV - 1 replication via a TLR - mediated pathway in monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC).

The HIV - 1Lai / Bal - Env infectious molecular clone was constructed by replacing the envelope ( env) gp160 amino acids 103 - 717 of the HIV - 1Lai ( B subtype that utilizes CXCR4) molecular clone with the corresponding region of HIV - 1Bal ( B subtype that utilizes CCR5).

The HIV - 1Lai / Bal - Env infectious clone is isogenic for the entire sequence of the parental HIV - 1Lai infectious clone except for the substitution of the HIV - 1Bal envelope co - receptor binding region in place of the HIV - 1Lai envelope co - receptor binding region.

Next, we knocked down NFAT5 mRNA levels in MDM using an siRNA that suppresses both NFAT5 mRNA and NFAT5 protein levels [ 31].

As shown in Figure 2, transfection of the siRNA specific for NFAT5 reduces NFAT5 mRNA levels in both MTb - uninfected ( p = 0. 048) and MTb - infected ( p = 0. 021) MDM as compared to transfection of control GFP siRNA into MTb - uninfected or - infected MDM ( Figure 2B).

Free virus levels were then measured in culture supernatants from MDM transfected with NFAT5 - specific siRNA or GFP control siRNA at days 6, 9 and 12 post - HIV - 1 infection to measure the impact of NFAT5 inhibition on MTb - induced HIV replication.

Specifically, we mutated two guanines ( GG) in the kappaB I site and changed them to thymine and adenine ( TA) ( HIV - 1Lai / Bal - env - kappaB I - mut) and also introduced the same GG to TA change in the second, more distal NF - kappaB site ( kappaB II) in HIV - 1Lai / Bal - env ( HIV - 1Lai / Bal - env - kappaB II - Mut).

As shown in Figure 3B, the N5 - Mut LTR could not bind NFAT5 ( compare lanes 12 - 15 and lanes 17 - 20), but p50 / p65 binding was not impaired ( compare lanes 2 - 5 with lanes 7 - 10).

Thus, binding of NFAT5 or NF - kappaB p50 / p65 to their respective motifs can be specifically disrupted within an overlapping or shared binding site.

Moreover, p24 levels were significantly lower at day 12 in cultures infected with HIV - 1Lai / Bal - env - kappaB II - Mut and HIV - 1Lai / Bal - env - kappaB I + II - Mut as compared to infection of cells with wild - type virus ( Figure 5D).

Since TNF is a MyD88 - dependent gene [ 21], [ 54], [ 55], as a positive control we measured TNF mRNA levels.

As shown in Figures 7C and 7D, knockdown of both IRAK1 and TRAF6 significantly inhibited MTb induced NFAT5 mRNA levels.

In this report we directly examined the relative roles of NFAT5 and NF - kappaB p50 / p65 in HIV - 1 replication under conditions of activation by MTb co - infection, when NF - kappaB levels in the nucleus are elevated.

Indeed, in response to hypertonic stress, NFAT5 binds to the aldose reductase ( AR) promoter and induces rapid hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4 [ 76].

( B) Specific mutation of the NFAT5 binding site abolishes NFAT5 binding to the viral LTR but does not affect NF - kappaB p50 / p65 binding to the overlapping NF - kappaB binding site.

These findings suggest that melanoma growth was inhibited in the CCR5 - / - mice, and that the elevation of IL - 1Ra, accompanied with decreased NF - kappaB, is significant in the inhibition of melanoma growth in CCR5 - / - mice.

Taken together, in the cytokine array experiment, the level of MIP - 1alpha ( which has a potent activity of T cell and B cell migration) was increased in the CCR5 - / - mice compared with those in the CCR5 + / + mice.

Our data thus show significant clinical implications of CCR5, because CCR5 is a G protein - coupled receptor and it is amenable to use as a small molecule for the inhibition of CCR5.

Interestingly, this does not reflect a generic requirement for growth factor signaling, as only some growth factors ( bFGF and IGF - 1, but not EGF and PDGF) promoted death ( Fig. 1B).

Secondly, simultaneous knockdown of Akt isoforms Akt1 and Akt2 using siRNAs protected cells from necroptosis induced by both zVAD. fmk and TNFalpha ( Fig. 2C).

We also observed an increase in the phosphorylation of both the p46 and p54 isoforms of JNK and its major substrate c - Jun ( Fig. 3A).

This again separated early RIP1 - independent changes, which likely reflect the ability of additional upstream kinases, such as Ask1 to activate JNK [ 27], from the late RIP1 kinase - dependent necroptotic signaling.

In some cases ( FoxO1, FoxO4, MDM2), a robust increase was observed.

Partial siRNA knockdown of S6 protein attenuated necroptosis as well ( Fig. S5E), suggesting that translational control by p70S6K / S6 may play a role in necroptosis.

RIP1 kinase - dependent Thr308 phosphorylation of Myr - Akt during necroptosis increased Myr - Akt activity as it did with endogenous Akt ( Fig. 5).

Some substrates, including p70S6K, S6, GSK - 3 and FoxO4, were fully phosphorylated even in the absence of zVAD. fmk.

On the other hand, phosphorylation of FoxO1 and MDM2 was significantly increased in the presence of zVAD. fmk, indicating that necroptotic Thr308 phosphorylation of Myr - Akt still promoted its activity.

Fas - associated protein with death domain ( FADD) - deficient Jurkat T lymphocytes and the macrophage cell lines ( J774A. 1 and RAW264. 7) are other models of necroptosis, which can be induced by stimulation with TNFalpha or zVAD. fmk, respectively [ 17].

As expected, specific inhibition or knockdown of JNK1 / 2 allowed phosphorylation of Akt on Thr308 while inhibiting the phosphorylation of c - Jun at Ser63 ( Fig. S10B, E), agreeing with our model.

Previous reports also suggested a critical role for c - Jun in necroptosis and autocrine TNFalpha synthesis [ 13], [ 14], [ 15] and we confirmed these conclusions using c - Jun siRNA knockdown ( Fig. S10H - J).

Importantly, while it is possible that necroptosis - specific targets of Akt exist, this regulation clearly involves a number of well established Akt targets including mTORC1, and potentially, GSK - 3, FoxO1 / 4, and MDM2.
