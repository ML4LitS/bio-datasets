Therefore, we investigated whether IRF - 4 promoter methylation or mutation may be involved in the regulation of IRF - 4 expression in leukemia cells.	"IRF - 4	35	42	Protein"	"IRF - 4	113	120	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
First, treatment of IRF - 4 - negative lymphoid, myeloid and monocytic cell lines with the methylation - inhibitor 5 - aza - 2 - deoxycytidine resulted in a time - and concentration - dependent increase of IRF - 4 mRNA and protein levels.	"IRF - 4	20	27	Protein"	"IRF - 4	206	213	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 206, ""end_span"": 213, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Second, using a restriction - PCR - assay and bisulfite - sequencing we identified specifically methylated CpG sites in IRF - 4 - negative but not in IRF - 4 - positive cells.	"IRF - 4	120	127	Protein"	"IRF - 4	150	157	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Together, these data suggest CpG site - specific IRF - 4 promoter methylation as a putative mechanism of down - regulated IRF - 4 expression in leukemia.	"IRF - 4	49	56	Protein"	"IRF - 4	122	129	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Treatment with interferon alpha ( IFN - alpha) prolongs survival of CML patients and is associated with a complete cytogenetic response in 5 - 33% of CML patients ( 1, 2).	"interferon alpha	15	31	Protein"	"IFN - alpha	34	45	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""interferon alpha"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IFN - alpha"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Consistent with the restriction of expression to immunocompetent cells, mice with deletion of IRF - 4 failed to develop mature and functionally active B - and T - lymphocytes ( 12), and the impaired expression of IRF - 4 in CML was predominately found in T - cells ( 3).	"IRF - 4	94	101	Protein"	"IRF - 4	213	220	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 213, ""end_span"": 220, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We analyzed the IRF - 4 promoter region for genetic aberrations and methylational status in IRF - 4 - positive and - negative hematopoietic cells.	"IRF - 4	16	23	Protein"	"IRF - 4	92	99	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
RNA expression analysis for IRF - 4 and the reference gene beta - actin was carried out by semi - quantitative PCR as described previously ( 3, 27).	"IRF - 4	28	35	Protein"	"beta - actin	59	71	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""beta - actin"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
After sequencing of the IRF - 4 promoter, it could be excluded that absence of IRF - 4 expression in any of the above cell lines was due to genetic aberrations.	"IRF - 4	24	31	Protein"	"IRF - 4	79	86	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, 2 bp changes ( nucleotide - 1081, T to C and - 1068, A to C) could be detected in both the IRF - 4 - positive BV - 173 and the IRF - 4 - negative LAMA - 84, EM - 2 and K - 562 ( Figure 1B).	"IRF - 4	100	107	Protein"	"IRF - 4	136	143	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Accordingly, treatment of the IRF - 4 - positive cell line BV - 173, SD - 1 and RPMI - 8226 with AzadC had no effect on IRF - 4 expression ( Figure 2D).	"IRF - 4	30	37	Protein"	"IRF - 4	120	127	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This implied that promoter methylation may control IRF - 4 expression, but an alternative explanation may be activation of positive transcriptional regulators of IRF - 4 by AzadC ( or AzaC).	"IRF - 4	51	58	Protein"	"IRF - 4	162	169	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 162, ""end_span"": 169, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This implied that IRF - 4 transcription in SD - 1 and BV - 173 cells is associated with less promoter methylation ( in BV - 173 especially at HpaII sites) as compared with the tested IRF - 4 - negative cells.	"IRF - 4	18	25	Protein"	"IRF - 4	183	190	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 183, ""end_span"": 190, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Intriguingly, a stretch of 13 CpG sites ( # 10 - 22; R2) was detected in between these regions, which were highly methylated in IRF - 4 - negative ( mean number of methylated clones 7. 1 of 8 with 89% methylated CpGs) but totally non - methylated in IRF - 4 - positive cells ( Figure 4A and B).	"IRF - 4	128	135	Protein"	"IRF - 4	250	257	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 250, ""end_span"": 257, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In addition, two CpG sites located in a NFkappaB ( # 48) and a SP1 element ( # 45) are less methylated in IRF - 4 - positive than in IRF - 4 - negative cells ( mean number of methylated clones: 1 / 8 versus 8 / 8).	"IRF - 4	106	113	Protein"	"IRF - 4	133	140	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To provide evidence for a direct effect of methylational status on IRF - 4 promoter activity we performed reporter gene assays with IRF - 4 promoter constructs before and after their in vitro methylation.	"IRF - 4	67	74	Protein"	"IRF - 4	132	139	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Intriguingly, methylation of the IRF - 4 promoter significantly decreased promoter activity in IRF - 4 - positive SD - 1 cells by 85. 0% ( Figure 5B).	"IRF - 4	33	40	Protein"	"IRF - 4	95	102	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The silencing effect of CpG methylation was not restricted to IRF - 4 - positive cells, since in vitro methylation led to a 92. 9% abrogation of promoter activity in IRF - 4 - negative Jurkat cells ( Figure 5C).	"IRF - 4	62	69	Protein"	"IRF - 4	166	173	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 166, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Since IRF - 4 expression in cell lines and CML can be induced by demethylation and successful IFN - alpha therapy ( 3), respectively, the existence of such genetic aberrations seems unlikely.	"IRF - 4	6	13	Protein"	"IFN - alpha	94	105	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IFN - alpha"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We then investigated whether the previously described down - regulation of IRF - 4 expression in human myeloid leukemias was due to a differential hypermethylation of the promoter, since the presented re - expression due to AzadC - treatment might also be a result of activation of positive transcriptional regulators of IRF - 4.	"IRF - 4	75	82	Protein"	"IRF - 4	321	328	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 321, ""end_span"": 328, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Methylation of CpG sites is a common mechanism of silencing genes in leukemia and has also been shown for another IRF, IRF - 7 ( 35) and for PU. 1 ( 36), an interacting partner of IRF - 4.	"IRF - 7	119	126	Protein"	"IRF - 4	180	187	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IRF - 7"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 180, ""end_span"": 187, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We found that IRF - 4 expression could indeed be connected to the methylation status of distinct CpG motifs in the IRF - 4 promoter.	"IRF - 4	14	21	Protein"	"IRF - 4	115	122	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
At two further CpG sites ( # 48, 45) the methylation status in IRF - 4 - positive was lower than that of IRF - 4 - negative cells.	"IRF - 4	63	70	Protein"	"IRF - 4	105	112	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Via in vitro methylation and reporter gene assays we could clearly appoint the silencing of the IRF - 4 promoter to a methylation effect, which may thus be the mechanism of IRF - 4 deregulation in vivo.	"IRF - 4	96	103	Protein"	"IRF - 4	173	180	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 173, ""end_span"": 180, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Interestingly, a positive correlation between DNMT1 expression levels and hypermethylation of p15INK4b has been detected in AML ( 25).	"DNMT1	46	51	Protein"	"p15INK4b	94	102	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""DNMT1"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p15INK4b"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The finding that IRF - 4 expression is silenced by promoter hypermethylation might represent a mechanism that accounts for the previously observed loss of IRF - 4 expression in CML.	"IRF - 4	17	24	Protein"	"IRF - 4	155	162	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 162, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Still, the obvious functional diversity of IRF - 4 remains remarkable and cannot be fully explained by the IRF - 4 promoter methylation status.	"IRF - 4	43	50	Protein"	"IRF - 4	107	114	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Overexpression of Foxp3 in HEK 293T and purified CD4 + T cells resulted in a dose - dependent and time - dependent decrease in basal levels of nuclear factor - kappaB ( NF - kappaB) activation.	"Foxp3	18	23	Protein"	"CD4	49	52	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Deletion of the carboxyl - terminal forkhead ( FKH) domain, critical for nuclear localization and DNA - binding activity, abrogated the ability of Foxp3 to suppress NF - kappaB activity in HEK 293T cells, but not in Jurkat or primary human CD4 + T cells.

Suppression of pathogenic T cell responses is mediated by naturally arising CD4 + CD25 + T regulatory cells ( Tregs) [ 2, 3].

Although it is clear that Foxp3 regulates T cell proliferation and cytokine production, very little is known concerning the molecular mechanisms of Foxp3 function.	"Foxp3	26	31	Protein"	"Foxp3	148	153	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In the present study, we expanded upon these observations by defining additional requirements of Foxp3 - mediated repression of NF - kappaB activation, and investigated whether Foxp3 could target additional signaling pathways by examining transcriptional activation of NF - kappaB - dependent and NF - kappaB - independent retroviral pathogens.	"Foxp3	97	102	Protein"	"Foxp3	177	182	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 182, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The characterization of the molecular targets of Foxp3 and the mechanism ( s) utilized by Foxp3 to support Treg development and function will aid in our understanding of the role Tregs play in the pathogenesis of human autoimmune disease.

Foxp3 mRNA was also assayed to monitor activity of the Foxp3 expression vector ( Figure 1B).	"Foxp3	0	5	Protein"	"Foxp3	55	60	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Extending these results from established, in vitro HEK cell lines to primary human lymphocytes, overexpression of Foxp3 in purified CD4 + T cells from three healthy donors also down - regulated the steady - state level of NF - kappaB activation ( Figure 1D).	"Foxp3	114	119	Protein"	"CD4	132	135	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These results recapitulate those from Bettelli and colleagues [ 15] demonstrating that Foxp3 functions, in part, to block NF - kappaB - dependent transcription in human cell lines as well as in primary human CD4 + T cells.	"Foxp3	87	92	Protein"	"CD4	208	211	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 208, ""end_span"": 211, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Unlike full - length Foxp3, which localizes almost exclusively to the nucleus and can bind in a sequence - specific manner to forkhead binding sites, the deltaFKH mutant fails to localize to the nucleus and thus cannot interact with promoter elements or nuclear proteins [ 16].	"Foxp3	21	26	Protein"	"deltaFKH mutant	154	169	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""deltaFKH mutant"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 169, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, we utilized the deltaFKH mutant to determine whether nuclear localization ( or other function associated with the FKH domain) of Foxp3 was a prerequisite for inhibition of NF - kappaB activation.	"deltaFKH mutant	27	42	Protein"	"Foxp3	140	145	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""deltaFKH mutant"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Although Foxp3 interaction with NF - kappaB presumably takes place in the nucleus, it may also be possible for a cytoplasmic Foxp3 protein to bind to NF - kappaB in the cytoplasm and prevent localization to the nucleus following an activation stimulus.	"Foxp3	9	14	Protein"	"Foxp3	125	130	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Overexpression of full - length Foxp3, but not of deltaFKH, was able to suppress activation of a cotransfected NF - kappaB reporter vector in HEK 293T cells ( Figure 2B).	"Foxp3	32	37	Protein"	"deltaFKH	50	58	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""deltaFKH"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Both Foxp3 and deltaFKH were expressed at very high levels following transfection as detected by real - time RT - PCR ( unpublished data).	"Foxp3	5	10	Protein"	"deltaFKH	15	23	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""deltaFKH"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These results are very interesting with respect to Foxp3 function, because they suggest that the carboxyl - terminal FKH domain, and possibly nuclear localization, are dispensable for Foxp3 function in T cell populations.	"Foxp3	51	56	Protein"	"Foxp3	184	189	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 184, ""end_span"": 189, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
If Foxp3 functions as a repressor of NF - kappaB - dependent gene expression, then we hypothesized that Foxp3 overexpression could selectively down - regulate transcription from promoters previously shown to be responsive to NF - kappaB.	"Foxp3	3	8	Protein"	"Foxp3	104	109	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Overexpression of full - length Foxp3, but not deltaFKH, in HEK 293T cells was able to inhibit basal activation of the HIV - 1 LTR ( Figure 3A), similar to what was previously demonstrated with the synthetic NF - kappaB reporter vector ( Figure 2B).	"Foxp3	32	37	Protein"	"deltaFKH	47	55	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""deltaFKH"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore, HIV - 1 LTR activation was suppressed by full - length Foxp3 and deltaFKH in Jurkat T cells ( Figure 3B).	"Foxp3	68	73	Protein"	"deltaFKH	78	86	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""deltaFKH"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, directly comparing the effect of Foxp3 overexpression on the activation of these two viral promoters demonstrated that Foxp3 was more capable of suppressing transcriptional activation of the HIV - 1 LTR ( Figure 3D) compared to the mutated HIV - 1 LTR ( Figure 3E).	"Foxp3	42	47	Protein"	"Foxp3	128	133	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The Transactivation Functions of HTLV - I Tax Are Suppressed by Foxp3	"Tax	42	45	Protein"	"Foxp3	64	69	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Tax"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Previous studies by Bettelli and colleagues have demonstrated that Foxp3 can repress both the basal levels of NF - kappaB activation as well as tumor necrosis factor - alpha - stimulated NF - kappaB activation [ 15].	"Foxp3	67	72	Protein"	"tumor necrosis factor - alpha	144	173	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""tumor necrosis factor - alpha"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Since the HTLV - I Tax protein can function at multiple levels in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus to stimulate activation of NF - kappaB [ 28, 29], we hypothesized that overexpression of Foxp3 may interfere with this process.	"Tax	19	22	Protein"	"Foxp3	190	195	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Tax"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 190, ""end_span"": 195, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These observations further suggest that the carboxyl - terminal FKH domain is required for inhibiting activation of NF - kappaB in the presence of Tax in HEK 293T cells, strikingly similar to the requirements of Foxp3 inhibition of basal NF - kappaB activation shown in Figure 2B.	"Tax	147	150	Protein"	"Foxp3	212	217	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Tax"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 212, ""end_span"": 217, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The suppressive effects shown in Figure 4A and 4B were not the result of Foxp3 down - regulating the expression of the transfected Tax plasmid as determined by real - time RT - PCR ( Figure 4C).	"Foxp3	73	78	Protein"	"Tax	131	134	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Tax"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These results strongly suggest that Foxp3 interacts with transcriptional regulators in addition to NF - kappaB and NF - AT, and that the carboxyl - terminal FKH domain, and therefore localization to the nucleus, are not required for inhibition of Tax - mediated HTLV - I LTR activation ( even in HEK 293T cells).

This Gal4 - BD - Tax fusion protein activated transcription of a synthetic promoter containing five Gal4 binding sites, while Gal4 - BD was insufficient to stimulate transcription by itself ( Figure 4D).

As illustrated in Figure 5, the level of Tax mRNA synthesized from ACH was down - regulated in the presence of Foxp3 compared to the level produced in the presence of the control vector.	"Tax	41	44	Protein"	"Foxp3	111	116	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Tax"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
deltaFKH did not have a discernable affect on Tax expression.	"deltaFKH	0	8	Protein"	"Tax	46	49	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""deltaFKH"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Tax"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These data indicate that Foxp3 is capable of repressing the expression of Tax from an infectious HTLV - I molecular clone.	"Foxp3	25	30	Protein"	"Tax	74	77	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Tax"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
They also support our recent reports that high proviral loads, which have been shown to correlate with high Tax mRNA in HTLV - I - infected patients, are associated with reduced Foxp3 expression [ 8, 34].	"Tax	108	111	Protein"	"Foxp3	178	183	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Tax"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 178, ""end_span"": 183, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, we hypothesized that Foxp3 may inhibit Tax transactivation of the HTLV - I LTR via disruption of the CREB signaling pathway.	"Foxp3	32	37	Protein"	"Tax	50	53	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Tax"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To test this possibility, HEK 293T cells were transfected with an HTLV - I LTR or synthetic CREB reporter vector along with a control expression vector ( EGFP) or expression vectors encoding Foxp3 or deltaFKH.	"Foxp3	191	196	Protein"	"deltaFKH	200	208	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 191, ""end_span"": 196, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""deltaFKH"", ""start_span"": 200, ""end_span"": 208, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As shown in Figure 6A, Foxp3 down - regulated basal activation of the HTLV - I LTR and transcription of a synthetic CREB reporter vector, suggesting that Foxp3 down - regulates HTLV - I LTR activation by targeting the CREB pathway.	"Foxp3	23	28	Protein"	"Foxp3	154	159	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 159, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Deletion of the FKH domain of Foxp3 dampened the suppressive effect of Foxp3, but did not completely abrogate suppression, as is seen with NF - kappaB - responsive promoters in HEK 293T cells.	"Foxp3	30	35	Protein"	"Foxp3	71	76	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Importantly, the mechanism of Foxp3 - mediated inhibition of CREB - dependent transcription was not due to a block in CREB - 1 protein expression, as determined by Western blot analysis ( Figure 6E).	"Foxp3	30	35	Protein"	"CREB - 1	118	126	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CREB - 1"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Stimulation of CREB - dependent transcription by reagents that activate adenylate cyclase and increase cAMP levels ( e. g., forskolin) increase the transactivation potential of CREB through phosphorylation of serine 133 by protein kinase A, which permits binding and recruitment of coactivators CBP / p300 to the promoter [ 37, 38].	"CBP	295	298	Protein"	"p300	301	305	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CBP"", ""start_span"": 295, ""end_span"": 298, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p300"", ""start_span"": 301, ""end_span"": 305, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
While Foxp3 has been shown to bind to and repress activation of both NF - kappaB and NF - AT, exactly how Foxp3 functions to bring about this affect has not been elucidated.	"Foxp3	6	11	Protein"	"Foxp3	106	111	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To determine how Foxp3 blocks CREB - dependent transcription, we examined whether Foxp3 was capable of ( 1) disrupting the recruitment of coactivator proteins and / or ( 2) preventing phosphorylation of CREB at serine 133 ( which is a prerequisite for coactivator recruitment).	"Foxp3	17	22	Protein"	"Foxp3	82	87	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As expected, p300 overexpression stimulated transcription of the Gal4 - BD - CREB - 1 fusion protein.	"p300	13	17	Protein"	"Gal4 - BD - CREB - 1	65	85	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""p300"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Gal4 - BD - CREB - 1"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Overexpression of Foxp3 failed to reduce the detectable levels of CREB phosphorylation using a phosphospecific antibody for CREB - 1 ( unpublished data).	"Foxp3	18	23	Protein"	"CREB - 1	124	132	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CREB - 1"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Collectively, these results suggest that Foxp3 antagonizes CREB - dependent gene expression by directly interacting with coactivator p300 and interfering with its function and / or recruitment to CREB - responsive promoter sequences.	"Foxp3	41	46	Protein"	"p300	133	137	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p300"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
A region that may also be important with respect to Foxp3 function is the leucine zipper domain, as demonstrated by the number of mutations associated with IPEX that have been mapped in this region of Foxp3.	"Foxp3	52	57	Protein"	"Foxp3	201	206	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 201, ""end_span"": 206, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Because the pathogenesis of a number of retroviral - induced immunologic disorders such as HIV - 1 / AIDS and HTLV - I / HAM / TSP have been associated with dysregulation of Foxp3 expression [ 8, 45], we also examined the role of Foxp3 in retroviral gene expression.	"Foxp3	174	179	Protein"	"Foxp3	230	235	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 174, ""end_span"": 179, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 230, ""end_span"": 235, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
HIV - 1 LTR activation in CD4 + T cells is critically dependent on two tandem NF - kappaB sites located between nucleotide positions - 102 and - 81 within the HIV - 1 enhancer region, whereas HTLV - I LTR activation in the presence or absence of the HTLV - I - encoded transactivator protein Tax is independent of NF - kappaB [ 18].	"CD4	26	29	Protein"	"Tax	292	295	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Tax"", ""start_span"": 292, ""end_span"": 295, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In addition, the FKH domain of Foxp3 was required for this inhibitory effect in HEK 293T cells, but not in Jurkat T cells, similar to Foxp3 - mediated suppression of a synthetic NF - kappaB reporter.	"Foxp3	31	36	Protein"	"Foxp3	134	139	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Foxp3 also affected two well - known functions of HTLV - I Tax: transactivation of the NF - kappaB pathway and, most surprisingly, transactivation of the HTLV - I LTR.	"Foxp3	0	5	Protein"	"Tax	59	62	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Tax"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Transactivation of the HTLV - I LTR by Tax involves the interaction of ATF / CREB factors with Tax in the nucleus.	"Tax	39	42	Protein"	"Tax	95	98	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Tax"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Tax"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Binding of Tax enhances ATF / CREB dimerization and promotes assembly of Tax - ATF / CREB complexes onto specific sequences in the viral promoter known as Tax - responsive elements.	"Tax	11	14	Protein"	"Tax	73	76	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Tax"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Tax"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Previous studies have demonstrated that the HTLV - I proviral load directly correlates with HTLV - I Tax mRNA load, the frequency of immunopathogenic virus - specific CD8 + T cells, and disease severity in patients with HAM / TSP [ 47].	"Tax	101	104	Protein"	"CD8	167	170	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Tax"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD8"", ""start_span"": 167, ""end_span"": 170, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As the activation of the HTLV - I LTR depends primarily on ATF / CREB proteins ( whether in the presence or the absence of Tax), we investigated whether Foxp3 could interact with this additional cellular signaling pathway.	"Tax	123	126	Protein"	"Foxp3	153	158	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Tax"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
While the DNA - binding activity of CREB is, in most cases, constitutive, the transactivation potential of CREB is regulated by the phosphorylation of CREB and recruitment of CBP / p300 [ 48].	"CBP	175	178	Protein"	"p300	181	185	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CBP"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p300"", ""start_span"": 181, ""end_span"": 185, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This may be the result of the physical interaction we detected between Foxp3 and p300.	"Foxp3	71	76	Protein"	"p300	81	85	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p300"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The effect of deltaFKH on basal activation of the HTLV - I LTR in HEK 293T cells was very similar to that shown for a synthetic CREB reporter, suggesting that the FKH domain of Foxp3 is important at some level.	"deltaFKH	14	22	Protein"	"Foxp3	177	182	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""deltaFKH"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 182, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As observed with NF - kappaB activation, the Foxp3 mutant lacking the FKH domain was a stronger inhibitor of CREB activation in CD4 + T cells than in HEK 293T epithelial cells.	"Foxp3	45	50	Protein"	"CD4	128	131	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, it appears that in CD4 + T cells, the FKH domain is dispensable for the proper functioning of Foxp3 with respect to both NF - kappaB and CREB activation.	"CD4	30	33	Protein"	"Foxp3	105	110	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, observing that this inhibitory effect is not absolute, a low level of viral gene expression may persist in CD4 + T cells ( in particular regulatory T cells, which are known reservoirs of HIV - 1 and HTLV - I) and result in the accumulation of viral proteins that either stimulate NF - kappaB and / or CREB activation or directly inhibit Foxp3 expression or function.

Future studies will be directed at identifying and characterizing cellular proteins that interact with Foxp3 both in the nucleus and cytoplasm, in order to better address how Foxp3 functions to guide the development and function of regulatory T cells in health and disease.

To investigate whether LMP1 expression contributes to lymphoma development, B cells were purified from splenocytes by positive selection using anti - CD19 MACS magnetic beads, and equivalent amounts of B cells were analyzed by immunoblotting.

To determine whether the higher level of LMP1 detected was due to an expansion of malignant lymphocytes, expression of LMP1 in the spleen was further evaluated by immunohistochemical staining.

Primary B cell cultures can be maintained through CD40 ligation and supplementation with IL4 [ 32].

To investigate whether LMP1 affects primary B cell survival and proliferation, splenocytes were cultured in the presence or absence of IL4 and analyzed by MTS as a metabolic marker, by ethidium monoazide ( EMA) exclusion for viability, and by 5 - bromo - 2 ' - deoxy - uridine ( BrdU) incorporation for proliferation.	"LMP1	23	27	Protein"	"IL4	135	138	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL4"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In the MTS assay, as expected, splenocytes from wild - type mice did not survive even with the addition of IL4 due to a lack of CD40 ligation ( Figure 3A).	"IL4	107	110	Protein"	"CD40	128	132	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL4"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD40"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Wild - type and LMP1 transgenic lymphoma cells had high levels of MTS activity even in the absence of IL4 ( Figure 3A).	"LMP1	16	20	Protein"	"IL4	102	105	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL4"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Enhancement in MTS activity was observed in LMP1 transgenic lymphoma cells by the addition of IL4; however, EMA exclusion did not reveal a similar increase.

This could reflect a difference for IL4 requirement in the metabolic activity versus the viability of LMP1 transgenic lymphoma cells.

Although expression of LMP1 could enhance survival of non - malignant primary lymphocytes, BrdU incorporation revealed that LMP1 expression alone was not sufficient to induce proliferation in culture ( unpublished data).	"LMP1	23	27	Protein"	"LMP1	124	128	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Interestingly, LMP1 lymphoma cells had significantly higher levels of proliferation in comparison to the spontaneous lymphoma that developed in an LMP1 - negative littermate ( 25% versus 4%).	"LMP1	15	19	Protein"	"LMP1	147	151	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The level of proliferation was not enhanced upon IL4 addition, confirming the IL4 independence observed in the viability studies ( Figure 3C; Table1).

However, the pathway was not disabled, as treatment of the lymphoma cells with IL4 induced Stat6 phosphorylation ( Figure 4C).

The enhancement of MTS activity induced by IL4 in wild - type lymphocytes could be neutralized by the addition of IL4 antibody ( Figure 4D).	"IL4	43	46	Protein"	"IL4	114	117	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL4"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL4"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, neutralizing antibodies to IL4 did not affect the MTS activity of LMP1 transgenic lymphoma cells ( Figure 4E).

Production of IL15 and IFNgamma has been associated with induction of cytotoxic effector responses in cells latently infected with EBV [ 33, 34].	"IL15	14	18	Protein"	"IFNgamma	23	31	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL15"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IFNgamma"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, transformation and growth properties induced by EBV are associated with the upregulation of IL10 [ 35 - 38]; hence, the effects of IL10 upregulation on the growth properties of the lymphoma cells were further examined.	"IL10	101	105	Protein"	"IL10	140	144	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL10"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL10"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, when comparing the same lymphomas, there was no correlation between the levels of IL10 induction and the levels of Stat3 activation.	"IL10	91	95	Protein"	"Stat3	124	129	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL10"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Stat3"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Additionally, there was no correlation between the levels of LMP1 expression and the levels of IL10 induction ( Figures 1A and 5A).	"LMP1	61	65	Protein"	"IL10	95	99	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL10"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This indicates that the induction of IL10 is a general property associated with enhanced survival and may only be indirectly affected by LMP1.	"IL10	37	41	Protein"	"LMP1	137	141	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL10"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Neutralizing antibodies to IL10 did not affect the survival of lymphoma cells as determined by the MTS assay ( unpublished data), suggesting constitutive activation of Stat3.	"IL10	27	31	Protein"	"Stat3	168	173	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL10"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Stat3"", ""start_span"": 168, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This means that although the lymphoma cells have constitutive Stat3 activation, it may be further enhanced by IL10 induction.	"Stat3	62	67	Protein"	"IL10	110	114	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Stat3"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL10"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Nuclear translocation of pStat3 is a consequence of activation, and nuclear pStat3 was not detected by immunohistochemistry staining of spleen sections from control mice.

LMP1 transformation of rodent fibroblasts requires activation of PI3K and Akt [ 5].	"LMP1	0	4	Protein"	"Akt	74	77	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Akt"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Similarly, activation of Akt without phosphorylation of GSK3 has been previously shown in EBV - positive HD [ 40].	"Akt	25	28	Protein"	"GSK3	56	60	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Akt"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GSK3"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In contrast, the wild - type lymphocytes lacked activated Akt but did have detectable phosphorylated GSK3.

To identify other potential Akt targets, immunoblot analysis for p - mTOR was performed.	"Akt	28	31	Protein"	"p - mTOR	65	73	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Akt"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p - mTOR"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Immunoblot analysis of splenic B cells did not consistently detect p - FoxO1 levels, a signal that targets FoxO1 for degradation.	"FoxO1	71	76	Protein"	"FoxO1	107	112	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FoxO1"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FoxO1"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Hence, degradation of FoxO1 was assessed by detection of total FoxO1 levels.	"FoxO1	22	27	Protein"	"FoxO1	63	68	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FoxO1"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FoxO1"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Triciribine inhibits the activation of Akt and at 20 muM has been shown to induce growth arrest in cancer cells with aberrant Akt activity [ 46].	"Akt	39	42	Protein"	"Akt	126	129	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Akt"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Akt"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The effects of triciribine on cell growth of the transgenic lymphocytes and lymphomas were apparent as low as 1 muM, suggesting that activation of Akt is required for the survival and growth of LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes and lymphoma cells ( Figure 7).	"Akt	147	150	Protein"	"LMP1	194	198	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Akt"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 194, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Treatment with triciribine effectively blocked phosphorylation of Akt, and phosphorylated Akt was no longer detected past 5 muM.

Phosphorylated Stat3 and IkappaBalpha were still present at 25 muM.	"Stat3	15	20	Protein"	"IkappaBalpha	25	37	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Stat3"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IkappaBalpha"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These findings suggest that triciribine specifically targets Akt and that Akt activation is required for the enhanced viability of the transgenic lymphocytes and lymphoma cells.

Although many of the molecular properties studied were similar between wild - type and LMP1 transgenic lymphomas, there were distinguishing biological properties, namely the ability of LMP1 transgenic lymphomas to induce higher levels of survival and proliferation.	"LMP1	87	91	Protein"	"LMP1	185	189	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 185, ""end_span"": 189, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Interestingly, although LMP1 transgenic mice develop lymphomas in the same B - 1a cell type as spontaneous wild - type lymphomas ( Figure 2), some signaling effects induced by LMP1 may explain the enhanced promotion to lymphomagenesis.	"LMP1	24	28	Protein"	"LMP1	176	180	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 176, ""end_span"": 180, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In contrast, the preponderance of tumors of B - 1a origin does not reflect effects of LMP1 signaling on B cell differentiation, as splenic B cells from healthy LMP1 transgenic mice contain similar numbers of B - 1 and B - 2 cells as wild - type mice.	"LMP1	86	90	Protein"	"LMP1	160	164	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 160, ""end_span"": 164, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In addition, LMP1 has been shown to stimulate IL10 expression in Burkitt lymphoma cell lines [ 61, 62].

Although LMP1 has been shown to deregulate the Rb pathway in epithelial cells [ 69], to our knowledge this is the first demonstration of this property in B lymphocytes.

The requirement for Akt activation was confirmed by the striking inhibition of lymphoma viability by triciribine, an Akt inhibitor.

However, the activated pAkt did not lead to phosphorylation and inactivation of the downstream target GSK3 ( Figure 6A).

In contrast, rapamycin, U0126, and SB202190 did not affect the survival of LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes or the wild - type and LMP1 transgenic lymphoma cells ( Figure 7A, 7C, and 7E).	"LMP1	75	79	Protein"	"LMP1	126	130	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Repression of the pro - apoptotic transcription factor FoxO1 in a PI3K - dependent manner can inhibit expression of bcl6, a transcription factor necessary for GC formation [ 49, 70].

Similarly, due to mimicry of CD40 signaling, transgenic LMP1 mice are also defective in GC formation [ 23, 49].

The constitutive signaling by LMP1 likely blocks GC formation through downregulation of bcl6.

Interestingly, clinical studies indicate that expression of LMP1 and bcl6 are mutually exclusive in non - HD and classical HD [ 72, 73].

Indeed, loss of FoxO1 expression in lymphoma cells correlated with a loss of p27 ( Figure 6B and 6C).

Relative to its expression in naive T cells, perforin ( Prf1) mRNA expression did not increase appreciably at day 2 but showed a reproducible decrease at day 4, followed by robust reexpression between days 4 and 8 ( Fig. 1, A - D).

T - bet mRNA and protein were not detectable in naive CD8 + T cells, but were strongly induced upon TCR priming ( day 2) and remained expressed through day 6 of differentiation ( Fig. 1, A and C; quantified in Fig. 1, B and D).

Furthermore, TNF - alpha synthesis can be attenuated in immune cells exposed to phosphodiesterase ( PDE) inhibition after challenge by a variety of pro - inflammatory stimulants. 4 The signaling mechanisms affected by PDE inhibition, which ultimately lead to the downregulation of TNF - alpha production, have not been well characterized in inflammatory cells.

The exposure of inflammatory cells to a variety of extracellular stimuli results in the initiation of transcriptional and posttranscriptional events, which culminate in the production of pro - inflammatory mediators. 11 - 14 TNF - alpha is released very early following shock and is considered an important mediator of the inflammatory cascade, since it regulates the synthesis of several other critical cytokines and chemokines. 15 A clear relationship between increased TNF - alpha synthesis and the development of shock and multiple organ dysfunction has been observed in animal models of sepsis. 15 - 17	"TNF - alpha	225	236	Protein"	"TNF - alpha	472	483	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNF - alpha"", ""start_span"": 225, ""end_span"": 236, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TNF - alpha"", ""start_span"": 472, ""end_span"": 483, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This allows the transcription factor to bind to promoter regions of specific pro - inflammatory genes and influence transcription. 27, 28 Because a number of potential kappaB sites are present in the nucleotide sequences of the TNF - alpha gene, NF - kappaB is considered to be a critical transcriptional factor involved in TNF - alpha gene expression and protein synthesis. 29, 30	"TNF - alpha	228	239	Protein"	"TNF - alpha	324	335	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNF - alpha"", ""start_span"": 228, ""end_span"": 239, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TNF - alpha"", ""start_span"": 324, ""end_span"": 335, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Culture with high doses of antigen for 7 days gave rise to Th1 cells expressing IFN - gamma upon restimulation ( Constant et al., 1995; Hosken et al., 1995), but not IL - 10 ( Figure S1A available online).

High Antigen Doses and STAT4 Are Required for the In Vivo Generation of IL - 10 - Producing Th1 Cells	"STAT4	23	28	Protein"	"IL - 10	72	79	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""STAT4"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To address the mechanisms regulating IL - 10 production by Th1 cells in vivo, we transferred DO11. 10 cells into BALB / c recipient mice and immunized the recipients with very high doses of OVA - protein with or without added lipopolysacharide ( LPS).	"IL - 10	37	44	Protein"	"OVA	190	193	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""OVA"", ""start_span"": 190, ""end_span"": 193, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
IL - 10 Production Is Maintained by High TCR Signal Strength and IL - 12	"IL - 10	0	7	Protein"	"IL - 12	65	72	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
For this, CD4 + T cells were differentiated for 2 consecutive weeks with high antigen doses in the presence or absence of IL - 12 throughout ( Figures 4A - 4D).	"CD4	10	13	Protein"	"IL - 12	122	129	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, IL - 10 induction under these conditions was abrogated when IL - 12p40 - deficient DCs were used as APCs ( Figure 4E).	"IL - 10	9	16	Protein"	"IL - 12p40	69	79	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 12p40"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, IL - 12 is essential during both primary and secondary antigenic stimulation for production of IL - 10 by Th1 cells.	"IL - 12	6	13	Protein"	"IL - 10	101	108	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, high antigen dose and IL - 12 are required for sustaining the induction of IL - 10 production by Th1 cells.	"IL - 12	28	35	Protein"	"IL - 10	81	88	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Our data showed that the maintenance of IL - 10 induction in Th1 cells required stimulation with high antigen dose, which to some extent could be compensated for by the addition of IL - 12.	"IL - 10	40	47	Protein"	"IL - 12	181	188	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 181, ""end_span"": 188, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To ensure that only T cell signaling was being affected by U0126, we used an APC - free system in which the T cells were differentiated in the presence of increasing doses of anti - CD3 and a constant amount of IL - 12.	"CD3	182	185	Protein"	"IL - 12	211	218	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CD3"", ""start_span"": 182, ""end_span"": 185, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 211, ""end_span"": 218, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Addition of U0126 to the cultures abrogated the production of IL - 10 at all doses of anti - CD3 ( Figure 5C).	"IL - 10	62	69	Protein"	"CD3	93	96	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD3"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
c - maf Expression Correlates with IL - 10 Production in Th1, Th2, and Th17 Cells	"c - maf	0	7	Protein"	"IL - 10	35	42	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""c - maf"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Low - dose antigen resulted in transcription of Il4 and this was abrogated by both high antigen doses and IL - 12 ( Figure 6A).	"Il4	48	51	Protein"	"IL - 12	106	113	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Il4"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
At low doses of antigen, IL - 12 had little effect to increase IL - 10 mRNA expression ( Figure 6A) in keeping with the protein data ( Figure 1A).	"IL - 12	25	32	Protein"	"IL - 10	63	70	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In contrast, high amounts of GATA - 3 mRNA expression were only observed under Th2 cell differentiation conditions ( low - dose antigen) ( Figure 6B), and this expression was markedly downregulated by both increasing antigen dose and coculture in IL - 12 ( Figure 6B).	"GATA - 3	29	37	Protein"	"IL - 12	247	254	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GATA - 3"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 247, ""end_span"": 254, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Interestingly, IL - 12 sustained the high expression of c - Maf mRNA even at the highest antigen dose ( Figure 6B).	"IL - 12	15	22	Protein"	"c - Maf	56	63	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""c - Maf"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
c - Maf is therefore expressed in all IL - 10 - expressing T cell populations tested ( Figures 6B and 6C) and may not be just a Th2 cell - specific transcription factor as originally thought ( Ho et al., 1996).	"c - Maf	0	7	Protein"	"IL - 10	38	45	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""c - Maf"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Our demonstration that loss of IL - 2 is accompanied by production of IL - 10 offers potential additional mechanisms whereby effector T cell responses may be dampened during chronic disease.	"IL - 2	31	37	Protein"	"IL - 10	70	77	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 2"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Using an in vivo transfer model of DO11. 10 TCR transgenic cells ( Castro et al., 2000), we showed that IL - 10 - producing Th1 cells were differentiated in the presence of high doses of OVA protein and LPS.	"IL - 10	104	111	Protein"	"OVA	187	190	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""OVA"", ""start_span"": 187, ""end_span"": 190, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We showed here that this induction of IL - 10 in Th1 cells in vivo was markedly, but not totally, reduced in STAT4 - deficient T cells as observed during T. gondii infection ( Jankovic et al., 2002).	"IL - 10	38	45	Protein"	"STAT4	109	114	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""STAT4"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
A high antigenic activation during T. gondii infection or high antigen doses delivered in the presence of LPS, as seen in our system, may compensate for an absolute requirement for IL - 12 in the induction of IL - 10 by Th1 cells.	"IL - 12	181	188	Protein"	"IL - 10	209	216	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 181, ""end_span"": 188, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 209, ""end_span"": 216, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In our in vitro system, repeated stimulation of Th1 cells with high antigen doses allowed the development of Th1 cells producing IL - 10 in an IL - 12 - dependent manner.	"IL - 10	129	136	Protein"	"IL - 12	143	150	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, a role for IFN - gamma in mediating IL - 10 reactivation by Th1 cells during secondary infection with T. gondii has been suggested ( Shaw et al., 2006).	"IFN - gamma	20	31	Protein"	"IL - 10	45	52	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IFN - gamma"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, in some cases, ICOS signaling also regulates IL - 4 production and Th2 responses ( Greenwald et al., 2005).	"ICOS	24	28	Protein"	"IL - 4	54	60	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ICOS"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 4"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Expression of c - maf was greatly diminished by high antigen doses in T cells and yet was unexpectedly maintained by IL - 12 and present in Th17 cells.	"c - maf	14	21	Protein"	"IL - 12	117	124	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""c - maf"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In summary, we show that although Th1, Th2, and Th17 CD4 + T cell subsets differentiate along distinct signaling and transcriptional pathways, they can all be induced to make IL - 10.	"CD4	53	56	Protein"	"IL - 10	175	182	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 182, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
At day 5 or 7, cells were restimulated with immobilized anti - CD3 ( 2 mug / ml) and anti - CD28 ( 2 mug / ml) ( 4 hr with BrefeldinA [ 10 mug / ml] in the last 2 hr) or with PdBU and Ionomycin ( 5 hr with BrefeldinA [ 1 mug / ml]).

Cells were harvested and restimulated in the presence of immobilized anti - CD3 ( 2 mug / ml) plus anti - CD28 ( 2 mug / ml) for 3 hr or immediately lysed.

Target gene mRNA expression was quantified either with SYBR Green ( Applied Biosystems) or with Master Mix ( Applied Biosystems) and normalized to ubiquitin or HPRT mRNA levels, respectively.

Cell lysates were prepared, equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS - PAGE, and phosphorylated or total ERK and actin were detected as described before ( Beinke et al., 2004).

Elevated levels of pro - inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as TNF, IL - 6 and CXCL8 are associated with several human diseases including cystic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis and AIDS.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the transcription factors, AP - 1 and NF - kappaB, in IL - 6 and CXCL8 regulation in Jurkat T - cells.	"IL - 6	107	113	Protein"	"CXCL8	118	123	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 6"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CXCL8"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Using an NF - kappaB activation inhibitor, we observed complete inhibition of IL - 6 expression while CXCL8 levels only decreased by 40% at the highest concentration.

The present study shows that NF - kappaB regulated IL - 6 but not CXCL8.	"IL - 6	51	57	Protein"	"CXCL8	66	71	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 6"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CXCL8"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This complex regulation of CXCL8 suggests that there is a need to further evaluate the signalling pathways in order to develop new treatment for diseases with elevated CXCL8 levels, such as AIDS and autoimmune diseases.

Elevated levels of pro - inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as TNF, IL - 6 and CXCL8, are associated with several human diseases including cystic fibrosis [ 3 - 5], pulmonary fibrosis [ 6, 7] and AIDS [ 8, 9].

Induction of CXCL8 has been suggested to be mediated through NF - kappaB in cooperation with AP - 1 [ 10, 11], however the precise mechanism is not fully elucidated, and treatment strategies aimed at inhibiting CXCL8 have failed [ 12].

Persistent production of IL - 6 and CXCL8 leads to chronic inflammation and enhanced survival of lymphocytes increasing serum cytokine / chemokine levels.

Both AP - 1 and NF - kappaB binding sites have been identified in the promoter region of IL - 6 and CXCL8 [ 12, 22], however, the mechanism by which these interleukins are regulated in T - cells is still not clear.

The present study suggests that the regulation of CXCL8 and IL - 6 is uncoupled.

Determination of the time course of cytokine induction in response to PMA showed that CXCL8 was already released between 2 - 6 h, while TNF and IL - 6 were released between 6 - 24 h ( figure 3).

The temporal induction of AP - 1 correlated to the CXCL8 levels and preceded the TNF and IL - 6 release.

Exposure of Jurkat T - cells to NAI resulted in a modest reduction of CXCL8 following PMA exposure, while it did not alter the CXCL8 release following HK E. coli exposure ( figure 5a).

In contrast, NAI resulted in a complete inhibition of IL - 6 following PMA exposure and a 45% inhibition following HK E. coli exposure ( figure 5c), suggesting an involvement of NF - kappaB in IL - 6 regulation.

Inhibition of PKC reduced CXCL8 release from 7 ng / ml to 3 ng / ml while it had a modest effect on IL - 6 and TNF ( figure 6a - c).

Inhibition of the JNK pathways resulted in a down - regulation of both CXCL8 and IL - 6, while no clear effect was observed on TNF expression ( figure 6a - c).

Analysis of mRNA levels using RT - qPCR ( table 2) showed that PMA induced both il - 6 and cxcl8 mRNA ( 5. 1 - fold and 111. 8 fold respectively).

The Bcl10 levels decreased following treatment with PMA, while in control cells, Bcl10 returned to higher levels by 24 h ( figure 7c).

The aim of the present study was to investigate IL - 6 and CXCL8 regulation by NF - kappaB and AP - 1 in Jurkat T - cells.

They showed that the inhibition of NF - kappaB was due to PKC - dependent degradation of IkappaB kinase beta and gamma in response to PMA.

In the present study, both PMA and HK E. coli resulted in comparable increases in IL - 6 while PMA was more potent at activating CXCL8 release.

Mutation of the NF - kappaB site did not affect IL - 2 expression, whereas mutation of the AP - 1 site or PKC depletion almost revoked IL - 2 release.

The NF - kappaB activation inhibitor ( NAI) showed specificity against NF - kappaB and resulted in a complete IL - 6 inhibition following induction with PMA and significant IL - 6 reduction after HK E. coli treatment.

Furthermore, CXCL8 expression was not affected by NAI following HK E. coli treatment, indicating a lack of correlation between CXCL8 and NF - kappaB.

Analysis of gene expression further confirmed that il - 6 and cxcl8 were upregulated by PMA.

Expression of il - 6 dropped below basal levels following inhibition of NF - kappaB and JNK whereas cxcl8 remained elevated above basal levels ( 16. 5 - fold and 7. 1 - fold respectively) following the same treatment.

Furthermore, inhibition of PKC did not result in a significant decrease of il - 6 or cxcl8, which is in accordance with protein data ( figure 6).

These results suggest that NF - kappaB is involved in IL - 6 regulation and release while it is not required for the expression of CXCL8 in Jurkat T cells.

In the present study, IL - 6 release was found to be associated with NF - kappaB activity while CXCL8 release more closely correlated with AP - 1 activity.

In addition, the temporal induction pattern of AP - 1 correlated to the release of CXCL8 while IL - 6 followed the NF - kappaB activity.

Likewise, blocking NF - kappaB activation resulted in a complete inhibition of IL - 6 while the CXCL8 levels remained elevated as shown both at the protein and mRNA level.

The present study indicates that in Jurkat T - cells, IL - 6 is regulated through NF - kappaB while CXCL8 regulation is independent of NF - kappaB and closely associated with AP - 1 activation.

These results reveal HOIP as a key component of the CD40 signaling pathway.	"HOIP	21	25	Protein"	"CD40	52	56	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""HOIP"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD40"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To test this hypothesis, we employed somatic cell gene targeting to ablate expression of HOIP in a mouse B cell line that has proven to be a useful model for B cell CD40 signaling [ 7], [ 8], [ 9].

We also found that the CD40 - mediated activation of NF - kappaB and the stress - activated protein kinase c - Jun kinase ( JNK) was defective in HOIP - deficient cells.

Consistent with impaired NF - kappaB activation, association of the IkappaB kinase ( IKK) complex with CD40 was undetectable in HOIP - deficient cells.

Together, our results indicate that HOIP plays a critical role in the activation of signaling pathways that regulate cellular responses to CD40 engagement.

We used a targeting vector capable of undergoing homologous recombination with Rnf31 ( the gene encoding HOIP) to disrupt the coding sequence of the gene in exon 5 ( Fig. 1A).

Engagement of CD40 on B cells upregulates expression of CD80 [ 10], a cell surface protein that promotes activation of T cells interacting with B cells and other APC.

Switching to IgE can be induced by the combination of IL - 4 and CD40 signals.	"IL - 4	54	60	Protein"	"CD40	65	69	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 4"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD40"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Collectively, these data demonstrate that HOIP has a critical role in cellular responses to CD40 signaling.

The results described above show that HOIP plays an important role in CD40 - mediated effector functions of B cells.

It follows that HOIP is likely a key mediator of CD40 signaling.	"HOIP	16	20	Protein"	"CD40	49	53	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""HOIP"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD40"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
CD40 - mediated JNK activation in HOIP - deficient cells was impaired as measured by phosphorylation of Thr183 and Tyr185 in JNK.

HOIP is necessary for association of the IKK complex with CD40	"HOIP	0	4	Protein"	"CD40	58	62	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""HOIP"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD40"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, we determined whether the association of HOIP with CD40 in A20. 2J cells was altered by treatment of cells with an inhibitor of cIAP activity, a membrane - permeable peptide derived from the apoptosis regulator SMAC [ 15].	"HOIP	52	56	Protein"	"CD40	62	66	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""HOIP"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD40"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
SMAC peptide treatment also resulted in a slight but reproducible decrease in the amount of the major HOIP form recovered by CD40 immunoprecipitation, along with an apparent increase in higher molecular weight species recognized by anti - HOIP antibody.

These data suggest that SMAC peptide treatment specifically alters the characteristics of CD40 - associated HOIP rather than the entire cellular pool of this protein.	"CD40	90	94	Protein"	"HOIP	108	112	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CD40"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""HOIP"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As shown here and in our previous study [ 6], IKKgamma present in CD40 immunoprecipitates appears to have a higher molecular weight than that found in cell lysates.

To confirm that this higher molecular weight species was indeed IKKgamma, we generated A20. 2J cell lines containing a stably integrated retroviral vector that encoded an epitope - tagged version of mouse IKKgamma.	"IKKgamma	64	72	Protein"	"IKKgamma	205	213	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IKKgamma"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IKKgamma"", ""start_span"": 205, ""end_span"": 213, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To determine what was responsible for the increased molecular weight of IKKgamma in CD40 immunoprecipitates, the protein samples were incubated with lambda phosphatase, which removes phosphates attached to tyrosine, threonine, or serine residues in proteins.	"IKKgamma	72	80	Protein"	"CD40	84	88	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IKKgamma"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD40"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This treatment reduced much of CD40 - associated IKKgamma to an apparent molecular weight similar to that of the protein in cell lysates ( Fig. 5C).

However, at least one band of significantly higher molecular weight remained after phosphatase treatment, suggesting that CD40 - associated IKKgamma is subject to at least one other modification in addition to phosphorylation.

Given the importance of CD40 signaling in both cellular and humoral immune responses, our results indicate that HOIP has a critical role in the regulation of the immune system.

A previous study indicates that HOIP may mediate direct contacts with the IKK complex [ 16], suggesting that it functions as an adaptor for the recruitment of the IKK complex to CD40.

These observations indicate that TRAF6 need not directly bind CD40 in order to mediate certain signals, suggesting the assembly of a signaling complex not directly associated with the receptor.

In this report, we identify conventional PKCs, including PKCalpha as important upstream kinases for M - CSF - induced NF - kappaB transcriptional activation, NF - kappaB - regulated gene expression, NF - kappaB p65 Ser276 phosphorylation, and macrophage survival.

After its release from IkappaBalpha, NF - kappaB p65 can undergo post - translational modification to activate gene transcription.

In TNFalpha - treated murine fibroblasts, Ser276 of NF - kappaB p65 is phosphorylated by MSK1 to enhance NF - kappaB transcriptional activity [ 18].

In human T cells, NF - kappaB p65 is constitutively phosphorylated on Ser536 to facilitate NF - kappaB p65 nuclear translocation following cellular stimulation [ 20].

Upon nuclear translocation, phosphorylation of Ser276 on NF - kappaB p65 by PKA recruits the transcription co - activator, p300 to potentiate NF - kappaB - regulated gene transcription [ 21].

Interestingly, the serine / threonine kinase Pim - 1 directly phosphorylates NF - kappaB p65 at Ser276 by stabilizing to prevent ubiquitin - proteasome degradation [ 24].

This activity was reduced by the conventional, but not novel, PKC inhibitors, dominant negative PKCalpha constructs or PKCalpha siRNA.

MDMs were transfected with the pNF - kappaB - SEAP reporter and then treated with the general PKC inhibitor, Ro - 31 - 8220; the conventional PKCalpha / beta inhibitor Go - 6976; or the intracellular calcium blocker BAPTA / AM.

To ensure that PKC specifically regulated NF - kappaB p65 and not the closely related family member, c - Rel, we co - transfected c - Rel and NF - kappaB - SEAP constructs into the Raw 264. 7 cell line and measured NF - kappaB activity in response to M - CSF.

As shown in Figure 5A, PKC inhibition with Ro - 31 - 8220 did not alter M - CSF - induced IkappaBalpha degradation, suggesting that M - CSF - induced PKC activity augmented NF - kappaB transcriptional activity by an alternative pathway, like post - translational modification of NF - kappaB p65.

Since M - CSF did not regulate NF - kappaB activation by influencing IkappaBalpha, we next sought to determine if M - CSF affected NF - kappaB p65 by post - translational mechanisms.	"IkappaBalpha	69	81	Protein"	"p65	143	146	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IkappaBalpha"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Non - phosphorylated NF - kappaB p65 was located in both cytosolic and nuclear fractions, but phosphorylated Ser276 and Ser536 NF - kappaB p65 was primarily located in nuclear fraction after M - CSF stimulation ( Figure 5D).	"p65	33	36	Protein"	"p65	139	142	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Importantly, Ro - 31 - 8220 reduced M - CSF - induced Ser276 phosphorylation of NF - kappaB p65 in both the cytosolic and nuclear fractions, while M - CSF - induced NF - kappaB p65 Ser536 phosphorylation was present in the nucleus regardless of PKC inhibition.	"p65	92	95	Protein"	"p65	177	180	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 180, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As shown in Figures 6A and 6B, M - CSF enhanced IkappaBalpha gene expression and PKC inhibition by Ro - 31 - 8220 decreased IkappaBalpha gene expression in both MDMs and RAW 264. 7 cells ( p < 0. 01), demonstrating that PKC affected NF - kappaB - regulated gene expression in macrophages.

Transfecting human macrophages with the KD - PKCalpha construct significantly reduced M - CSF - induced NF - kappaB activity compared to WT - PKCalpha transfected cells ( p = 0. 016).

Similarly, RAW 264. 7 cells transfected with WT - PKCalpha had 2. 5 - fold more NF - kappaB transcriptional activity after M - CSF activation compared to unstimulated RAW 264. 7 cells ( NS) transfected with WT - PKCalpha ( Figure 7B).

Expression of the KD - PKCalpha construct into RAW 264. 7 cells reduced M - CSF - induced NF - kappaB activity to 1. 5 - fold ( p = 0. 045) compared to cells transfected with WT PKCalpha.	"PKCalpha	23	31	Protein"	"PKCalpha	178	186	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PKCalpha"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PKCalpha"", ""start_span"": 178, ""end_span"": 186, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As shown in Figure 7D, expression of KD - PKCalpha in RAW 264. 7 cells did not affect the constitutive phosphorylation at Ser536 of NF - kappaB p65, but attenuated the phosphorylation at Ser276.	"PKCalpha	42	50	Protein"	"p65	144	147	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PKCalpha"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 147, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These observations demonstrate that PKCalpha is important in M - CSF - regulated cell survival and NF - kappaB activation and likely regulated through phosphorylation of Ser276 of NF - kappaB p65.	"PKCalpha	36	44	Protein"	"p65	192	195	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PKCalpha"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 192, ""end_span"": 195, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To further validate the impact that PKCalpha played in M - CSF - induced NF - kappaB transcriptional activity, we next employed PKCalpha siRNA treatment of MDM or RAW cells.

In Figure 7H, we confirmed that PKCalpha siRNA transfection decreased PKCalpha protein expression in both MDM and Raw 264. 7 cells.

In contrast, expressing WT NF - kappaB p65 ( p65 WT) increased NF - kappaB activity, while the general PKC inhibitor Ro - 31 - 8220 decreased this NF - kappaB activity ( p = 0. 001).

Notably, the introduction of NF - kappaB p65 276 S / A construct significantly reduced NF - kappaB activity compared with the WT NF - kappaB p65 construct ( p = 0. 005) and M - CSF treatment was unable to overcome this inhibition.

Introducing NF - kappaB p65 276 S / A constructs significantly reduced NF - kappaB activity compared with the WT NF - kappaB p65 construct ( p = 0. 001).

Our data demonstrate that Ser276 of NF - kappaB p65 is essential in regulating NF - kappaB activity and suggests that PKC regulates NF - kappaB activity by modulating the phosphorylation of NF - kappaB p65 at Ser276 residue.	"p65	48	51	Protein"	"p65	202	205	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 202, ""end_span"": 205, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We showed inhibition of conventional PKCs by PKC inhibitors, kinase deficient PKCalpha or PKCalpha siRNA blocked M - CSF - induced cell survival and NF - kappaB - regulated gene expression.

Consistent with these findings the dominant negative PKCalpha constructs also inhibited NF - kappaB p65 phosphorylation at Ser276 but not at Ser536 resulting in reduced NF - kappaB transcriptional activation and M - CSF - induced MDM survival.

Finally, in a NF - kappaB p65 - / - fibroblast cell line, we confirmed that the Ser276 residue of NF - kappaB p65 is important and essential for PKC modulation of NF - kappaB activity.

In addition to PKA, Ser276 can be phosphorylated by MSK1 in the nucleus upon TNFalpha treatment [ 18].

Notably, in addition to phosphorylating Ser276 of NF - kappaB, our study revealed that M - CSF also modulated the phosphorylation of the NF - kappaB p65 subunit at Ser536, however, PKC inhibitors or kinase deficient PKCalpha constructs did not affect this phosphorylation event.

It is notable that M - CSF activated NF - kappaB p65 Ser276 phosphorylation and transcriptional activation in a PKCalpha - dependent manner.

Neutralization of IL5 by antibody treatment or crosses with IL5 - deficient mice reduced the number of circulating and cutaneous eosinophils, but failed to reduce the onset and severity of the dermatitis [ 6].

Recently, three independent groups identified SHARPIN as an essential component of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex ( LUBAC) that regulates TNFalpha - induced canonical NF - kappaB signaling [ 7] - [ 9].	"SHARPIN	46	53	Protein"	"TNFalpha	151	159	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SHARPIN"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 151, ""end_span"": 159, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
SHARPIN - deficient mouse embryonic fibroblast ( MEF) were sensitized to TNFalpha - induced apoptosis and cell death was implicated as a factor in the dermatitis of cpdm mice [ 7] - [ 9].

Taken together, these results reveal that SHARPIN is a novel regulatory molecule in DC biology and suggest that the dysregulated function of SHARPIN - deficient DC plays a role in the cpdm phenotype.	"SHARPIN	42	49	Protein"	"SHARPIN	141	148	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SHARPIN"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SHARPIN"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These functional motifs constitute similar domain profiles that are present in the SHARPIN protein of all three origins ( Fig. 1A), suggesting that SHARPIN exerts highly conserved functions across species.

Transfection of Flag - tagged Sharpin in fibroblasts ( NIH3T3) and macrophages ( RAW264. 7) indicated cytoplasmic localization of the SHARPIN protein ( Fig. 1E).

The TLR3 ligand poly I: C and the TLR4 ligand LPS each activate overlapping but different signaling pathways and were used to induce DC maturation [ 17], [ 18].	"TLR3	4	8	Protein"	"TLR4	34	38	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TLR3"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TLR4"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Incubation with LPS or poly I: C resulted in secretion of IL6, IL12P70, and GMCSF from both WT and cpdm BMDC; however, BMDC from cpdm mice produced significantly less of all three cytokines compared with WT BMDC ( Fig. 3A - C, E - F).	"IL6	58	61	Protein"	"GMCSF	76	81	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL6"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GMCSF"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In vivo complementation with a Sharpin gene - containing BAC reversed the phenotype of the mutant mice [ 2], and BMDC generated from these rescued mice secreted significantly more IL12P70 than BMDC from cpdm mice ( Fig. 3G), supporting a necessary role of SHARPIN for the production of IL12P70.

The supernatants from LPS - stimulated cpdm BMDC contained significantly lower levels of IL10 than stimulated WT BMDC ( Fig. 5B), suggesting that IL10 was not responsible for decreased secretion of IL12P70 by cpdm BMDC.	"IL10	89	93	Protein"	"IL10	146	150	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL10"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL10"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, the transcript level of A20 was lower in LPS - activated cpdm BMDC than WT controls ( Fig. 5C), thereby ruling out overexpression of A20 as a factor in the reduced cytokine production.	"A20	33	36	Protein"	"A20	142	145	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""A20"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""A20"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Co - culture of allogeneic naive CD4 + T cells with WT BMDC stimulated with LPS or poly I: C elicited robust IFNgamma production, whereas the concentration of IFNgamma in cpdm BMDC - T cell cultures was significantly lower after LPS stimulation ( Fig. 7A), indicating impaired Th1 - polarizing abilities of cpdm BMDC.	"IFNgamma	109	117	Protein"	"IFNgamma	159	167	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IFNgamma"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IFNgamma"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 167, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Pam3CYS - matured WT BMDC induced robust IFNgamma production at a significantly higher level than cpdm BMDC ( Fig. 7A).

The reduced Th1 differentiation following Pam3CYS stimulation is consistent with the recent report of decreased IL12 production in cpdm macrophages following TLR2 stimulation [ 31].	"Pam3CYS	42	49	Protein"	"TLR2	158	162	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Pam3CYS"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TLR2"", ""start_span"": 158, ""end_span"": 162, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Despite the distinct Th1 - and Th2 - stimulating abilities of WT and cpdm BMDC, they were equally effective in IL2 production from BMDC - T cell co - cultures except for poly I: C stimulation where WT BMDC induced more IL2 than cpdm BMDC ( Fig. 7C).

The importance of IL12P70 in regulating Th1 and Th2 immune responses in mice was clearly demonstrated in IL12P35 - and IL12P40 - deficient mice [ 38], [ 39] and through clinical studies in human patients [ 40] - [ 42].

Ubiquitous activation of NF - kappaB by removing inhibitors such as A20 and ITCH through genetic manipulation results in widespread inflammation, consistent with the role of NF - kappaB in the production of pro - inflammatory mediators [ 45], [ 46].

Experiments with mice with cell - and tissue - specific deletion of Sharpin, currently under way, will help to elucidate the role of SHARPIN in inflammation.

LPS and poly I: C used here are well - defined ligands that specifically engage TLR4 and TLR3, respectively.

The Sharpin null mutation disrupts the ubiquitylation process and abrogates the TNFalpha - induced NF - kappaB signaling pathway.
