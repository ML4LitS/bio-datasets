We observed no genetic alterations in the IRF - 4 promoter, which can account for the lack of IRF - 4 expression: The detected base pair changes at position - 1081 ( T to C substitution), at position - 1068 ( A to C substitution) and at position - 116 ( A to C substitution) are unlikely responsible for absent IRF - 4 - expression since the first two mutations were found both in IRF - 4 - positive and - negative cells whereas the latter change was not detected consistently in all IRF - 4 - negative or - positive cells and may thus be a polymorphism.

Whereas high doses of antigen, with sustained TCR signaling and extracellular - signal regulated ( ERK) mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK) phosphorylation, result in Th1 cells producing IFN - gamma via an IL - 12 - independent mechanism, low doses of antigen, with transient ERK1 and ERK2 activation, favor Th2 responses and IL - 4 secretion ( Constant et al., 1995; Hosken et al., 1995; Jorritsma et al., 2003; Yamane et al., 2005).

At low doses of antigen, IL - 12 abrogated the development of Th2 cells and induced IFN - gamma expression but only low levels of IL - 10 expression, suggesting that IL - 12 per se was not sufficient to induce significant IL - 10 production in Th1 cells ( Figure 1A).

Although the apparent peak and amount of ERK1 and ERK2 activation varied slightly between experiments, a consistent finding was that high antigen dose differentiated Th1 cells always showed enhanced and prolonged ERK1 and ERK2 activation in the presence of IL - 12, regardless of whether they were restimulated with high or low antigen dose ( Figure 5B).

The continuing emergence of activated CD4 + T cells, even though few in number, may be crucial in sustaining the activation of macrophages and synovial fibroblasts through cell surface signaling by means of cell surface CD69 and CD11, as well as the release of proinflammatory Th1 cytokines such as interferon gamma ( IFN) - gamma and IL - 17 [ 21, 22].

We found that LPS - stimulated SerpinB2 promoter activity was significantly increased in Cebpb + / + MEFs and abrogated in Cebpb - / - MEFs ( Fig. 8A), indicating that endogenous C / EBP - beta is required for LPS - induced SerpinB2 proximal promoter activity.

To investigate C / EBP - beta phosphorylation sites that may be important for LPS - stimulated SerpinB2 proximal promoter activity ( Fig. 8B), we co - expressed several C / EBP - beta phospho - acceptor mutants in which the critical threonine or serine residue was mutated to an alanine, along with the pGLmP - 539 murine SerpinB2 luciferase reporter in Cebpb - / - MEFs.

Re - expression of wild - type C / EBP - beta in Cebpb - / - MEFs significantly stimulated SerpinB2 luciferase reporter gene expression in the presence of LPS by ~ 3 fold ( Fig. 8C, left), confirming the importance of C / EBP - beta to LPS - induced SerpinB2 gene transcription.

C / EBP - betaT188A - transfected MEFs exhibited SerpinB2 promoter activity similar to that of wild - type C / EBP - beta - transfected MEFs, whereas the expression of C / EBP - betaS64A potentiated SerpinB2 promoter activity in response to LPS ( Fig. 8C, right).

Cebpb - / - MEFs were co - transfected with expression plasmids encoding wild - type C / EBP - beta or the indicated C / EBP - beta phospho - acceptor mutants, along with the pGLmP - 539 SerpinB2 promoter - luciferase reporter and beta - galactosidase reporter plasmids, and stimulated with LPS for 4 hrs.
