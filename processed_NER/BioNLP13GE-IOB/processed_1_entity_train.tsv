A 72 h AzadC - treatment resulted in a concentration - dependent activation of IRF - 4 transcription in Jurkat and CML - T1 T - cells as well as in U - 937, K - 562 and EM - 2 cell lines ( Figure 2A).

To further investigate promoter methylation as a regulatory mechanism of IRF - 4 gene expression, restriction - PCR - assays were performed ( 20, 24), where only methylated DNA would not be cut enabling subsequent PCR amplification and vice versa.

After digestion with HpaII and Bsp143II a sufficient PCR amplification of F1 and F2 was detected in DNA from IRF - 4 - negative Jurkat, CML - T1, U - 937, K - 562 and EM - 2 cells, suggesting a promoter methylation ( and restriction protection) at the respective recognition sites ( Figure 3B and C).

In order to exactly map the methylation sites within the IRF - 4 promoter, we treated DNA of Jurkat, CML - T1, U - 937, K - 562 and EM - 2 cells as well as of SD - 1, RPMI - 8226 and BV - 173 control cells with bisulfite, which chemically converts unmethylated cytosine to uracil, whereas it has no effect on methylated cytosine, i. e. in CpG ( 34).

Since abundance of DNMT and MBP contribute to promoter regulation via methylation ( 25, 26, 28), we studied their mRNA expression to investigate a possible mechanism for the observed methylation differences in the IRF - 4 promoter.

To elucidate the relevance of this mechanism for the regulation of IRF - 4 expression, various leukemic cells were treated with demethylating agents and promoters were sequenced after bisulfite treatment.

These results led us to hypothesize that Foxp3 acts on HTLV - I gene expression by interacting with proteins important for driving HTLV - I LTR activity in vivo.	"Foxp3	41	46	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Previous studies have demonstrated that the Tax - responsive elements within the HTLV - I LTR play a crucial role in driving Tax - mediated transactivation of the HTLV - I LTR [ 18].	"Tax	44	47	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Tax"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The Tax - responsive elements have been shown to resemble CREB binding sites, bind CREB in vitro and in vivo, and facilitate HTLV - I LTR activation both in the presence and in the absence of Tax [ 35, 36].

Since both of these events are required for CREB - dependent gene expression, we hypothesized that Foxp3 may affect CREB activation at both steps.	"Foxp3	99	104	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

In the present study, we show that Foxp3 functions as a potent repressor of NF - kappaB - and CREB - dependent transcriptional activation.	"Foxp3	35	40	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Interestingly, the majority of the genetic mutations associated with IPEX, a severe autoimmune disorder caused by functional inactivation of Foxp3, map to the carboxyl - terminal FKH domain or the leucine zipper domain in the central region of the protein.

It is possible that the FKH domain has a complex tertiary structure that is particularly sensitive to misfolding caused by genetic mutations and that an intact FKH domain is absolutely critical for promoting Foxp3 function in the nucleus, whereas the structure of the amino - terminal proline - rich region may tolerate certain mutations as long as the NF - kappaB / NF - AT binding motif remains unaltered.

Interestingly, 2 / 5 LMP1 transgenic lymphomas analyzed ( lymphomas 2 and 4) were doubly positive for low levels of both kappa and lambda light chains ( Figure 2A).	"LMP1	21	25	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Previous characterization of the LMP1 lymphomas had revealed that the lymphomas were clonal as determined by Ig heavy chain rearrangement [ 26], and analysis of kappa chain rearrangement ( Figure S1) of the samples analyzed in this study confirmed clonality.

In agreement with the flow cytometry analysis, LMP1 transgenic lymphomas 2 and 4 were also positive for kappa and lambda light chains by immunoblot analysis ( Figure 2C), confirming that these lymphomas express both light chains.

Although wild - type lymphocytes cannot be maintained in culture with IL4 supplementation alone ( Figure 3A), slight enhancement in MTS activity could be detected if the cells were analyzed at an earlier time point, at 1 d ( Figure 4D) versus 3 d ( Figure 3A) post - harvest.

However, the enhanced viability of LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes was effectively blocked by treatment with triciribine, BAY11 - 7085, cucurbitacin I, and slightly with SB203580, but not by treatment with rapamycin, U0126, or AG490 ( Figure 7).

BAY11 - 7085, an inhibitor of NFkappaB signaling, also greatly decreased the viability of the LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes and lymphoma cells at doses as low as 1 muM, and at 5 muM the cells were completely nonviable ( Figure 7).

Similarly, LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes and lymphoma cells were susceptible to cucurbitacin I treatment starting at 0. 1 muM, a dose that corresponds closely to the reported IC50 of 500 nM ( Figure 7) [ 47].

However, effects of SB202190 were only apparent at high doses ( > 10 muM), much higher than the reported IC50 of 0. 35 muM, suggesting that p38 MAPK does not significantly contribute to the enhanced viability in LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes or lymphoma cells ( Figure 7).

It is noteworthy that expression of LMP1 in transgenic mice has been shown to inhibit the formation of GCs [ 23, 49], preventing typical B - 2 cells from antigen - driven selection and expansion.

Interestingly, LMP2 signaling also favors development of B - 1 cells, but this occurs in the absence of transformation.	"LMP2	15	19	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LMP2"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These results suggest that the mimicry of B cell receptor signaling by LMP2 promotes B - 1 cell differentiation but not transformation [ 24, 50, 51].	"LMP2	71	75	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LMP2"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This promotion of B - 1 differentiation may account for the ability of LMP2 to exacerbate autoimmunity and bypass anergy induction [ 52, 53].	"LMP2	71	75	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LMP2"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In support of this lack of effect, the differentiation of B - 1 versus B - 2 cells is thought to be independent of CD40 signaling [ 54].	"CD40	115	119	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CD40"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The data presented in this study indicate that although LMP1 is expressed in all B lymphocytes in the transgenic mice, malignancy develops in this specific subset of B cells.	"LMP1	56	60	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The elevated expression of LMP1 in B - 1a cells and the activation of specific pathways apparently induce malignant growth.	"LMP1	27	31	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This is similar to EBV - associated cancers in vivo, where pathways that are activated by LMP1 are also activated in the less prevalent EBV - negative forms of the cancers [ 40, 55 - 58].	"LMP1	90	94	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, the contribution of EBV and LMP1 to tumor development is apparently the continuous activation of pathways that can also be sporadically activated and contribute to tumor development.	"LMP1	34	38	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Induction of IL10 is associated with the transformation of B - 1 lymphomas in mice [ 59, 60] and is frequently associated with EBV - positive B cell malignancies acting as a B cell growth factor [ 35 - 38].

These results suggest that downregulation of TNF - alpha production by PTX in LPS - stimulated mononuclear cells is, at least in part, PKA - independent.	"TNF - alpha	45	56	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNF - alpha"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Because of its importance in orchestrating multiple steps of the inflammatory response, strategies aimed at decreasing TNF - alpha levels or attenuating its production seem attractive.

PDE inhibitors have been shown to downregulate TNF - alpha production in distinct human cell populations.	"TNF - alpha	47	58	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNF - alpha"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The mechanisms by which PTX, a non - specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor, significantly and consistently decreases TNF - alpha production have not been completely elucidated.

This classic pathway has been challenged as the sole mechanism involved in the modulation of inflammation by cAMP - enhancing drugs, and alternative mechanisms involving PKA - independent pathways have been proposed. 6 - 8 In this series of experiments, we observed a significant attenuation of TNF - alpha production in LPS - stimulated human mononuclear cells following PTX administration, independent of PKA activation.

We used a nonspecific phosphodiesterase inhibitor, PTX, in the present study because it has been used clinically in the treatment of a variety of conditions in which inflammation is an important component of the pathophysiology of the disease process. 19 Additionally, the use of PTX in sepsis as an adjunct to other treatments to maintain adequate organ function has been explored based upon its effects on TNF - alpha synthesis.

However, the reported beneficial effects of PTX are not only related to the downregulation of TNF - alphabut also to PTX ' s hemorrheologic properties, its ability to reduce neutrophil activation, and its beneficial effects on microcirculation, cardiac performance, and organ injury. 20 - 25 Herein, we demonstrated that the downregulatory effects of PTX in human mononuclear cells involves modulation of pathways that involve NF - kappaB and CREB, two major transcription factors involved in the inflammatory cascade.

Phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and subsequent degradation of I - kappaBalpha results in NF - kappaB nuclear translocation.	"I - kappaBalpha	63	78	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""I - kappaBalpha"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Previous studies that have evaluated the effects of cAMP - elevating drugs on I - kappaBalpha and NF - kappaB have reported conflicting results.	"I - kappaBalpha	78	93	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""I - kappaBalpha"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This group also demonstrated that forskolin did not inhibit the DNA - binding activity of NF - kappaB and that CREB was not involved in forskolin - induced decrease in p65 transcriptional activity. 33 Similar results were reported by Ollivier et al. using THP - 1 cells and endothelial cells treated with forskolin or dibutyryl cAMP, two agents known to function through cAMP elevation and subsequent PKA activation. 9 The differences between our results and those mentioned above may be explained by the use of different cell types and exogenous stimulants.	"p65	168	171	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 168, ""end_span"": 171, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It is also possible that PTX exerts its anti - inflammatory effects on the NF - kappaB pathway independent of PKA, as suggested by the continued attenuation of LPS - induced TNF - alpha production by PTX in the presence or absence of PKA inhibition observed in this study.	"TNF - alpha	174	185	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNF - alpha"", ""start_span"": 174, ""end_span"": 185, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Moreover, AP - 1 and CREB recognize a similar DNA binding sequence in the promoter region of the TNF - alpha gene35.	"TNF - alpha	97	108	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNF - alpha"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Given these relationships, it is conceivable that PTX may exert some of its anti - inflammatory actions by affecting AP - 1 activation and favoring CREB binding, thus inhibiting TNF - alpha gene transcription.	"TNF - alpha	178	189	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNF - alpha"", ""start_span"": 178, ""end_span"": 189, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In summary, we have demonstrated that PDE inhibition of human mononuclear cells downregulates TNF - alpha production, at least in part, through a PKA - independent mechanism.	"TNF - alpha	94	105	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNF - alpha"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, PTX may serve as a potential adjunct therapeutic for the treatment of conditions in which TNF - alpha production plays a significant role.	"TNF - alpha	101	112	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNF - alpha"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, the signals that direct the development of IL - 10 - producing T helper 1 ( Th1) cells are undefined.	"IL - 10	52	59	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Despite having distinct functions in protection against pathogens, all Th cells share the important task of controlling overexuberant immune responses by means of IL - 10 production.	"IL - 10	163	170	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 163, ""end_span"": 170, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
IL - 10 limits the immune and inflammatory responses to pathogens and gut flora and prevents damage to the host ( Moore et al., 2001; O ' Garra and Vieira, 2004), but when dysregulated may result in chronic infection ( Brooks et al., 2006; Ejrnaes et al., 2006; Moore et al., 2001).	"IL - 10	0	7	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
IL - 10 is expressed by T helper 2 ( Th2) cells, B cells, DCs, and macrophages ( Moore et al., 2001), and also by Th1 cells ( Anderson et al., 2007; Assenmacher et al., 1994; Del Prete et al., 1993; Gerosa et al., 1996; Jankovic et al., 2007; Pohl - Koppe et al., 1998) and ( reviewed in O ' Garra and Vieira, 2007; Trinchieri, 2007), certain regulatory ( Treg) T cells ( Moore et al., 2001; O ' Garra and Vieira, 2004; Roncarolo et al., 2006), and Th17 cells ( Awasthi et al., 2007; Fitzgerald et al., 2007; McGeachy et al., 2007; Stumhofer et al., 2007).	"IL - 10	0	7	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
IL - 10 production by Th1 cells was also reported in animals infected with Toxoplasma gondii ( Jankovic et al., 2002; Shaw et al., 2006) or with Leishmania major ( Anderson et al., 2007) and shown to be required for regulation of the immune response in these infections ( Anderson et al., 2007; Jankovic et al., 2007).	"IL - 10	0	7	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Because Th1 and Th2 cells cross regulate each other ' s development and function and can suppress Th17 cell responses, and all differentiate along distinct signaling pathways ( Glimcher and Murphy, 2000; Stockinger and Veldhoen, 2007), IL - 10 produced by all these Th cells may thus act as a feedback regulator to control the pathology associated with an overexuberant, albeit efficacious, inflammatory response.	"IL - 10	236	243	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 236, ""end_span"": 243, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Whether IL - 10 production by these different Th cell subsets is induced by independent and / or common mechanisms is unknown.	"IL - 10	8	15	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This common but highly regulated pathway for IL - 10 induction and maintenance ensures its function as a feedback loop to control damage to the host and also allows a protective response to ensue as opposed to chronic infection.

PD184352 caused a similar inhibition of IL - 10 production by Th1 cells in a dose - dependent fashion ( Figure 5D and Figure S5A).	"IL - 10	40	47	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Differentiation of T cells under low antigen dose led to expression of c - maf, in keeping with the Th2 cell profile ( Ho et al., 1996), which was almost completely abrogated by increasing doses of antigen ( Figure 6B).	"c - maf	71	78	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""c - maf"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Th17 cells also expressed high amounts of c - maf ( Figure 6C), confirming a recent report ( Bauquet et al., 2009).	"c - maf	42	49	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""c - maf"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
IL - 10 expression by cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems reflects the importance of this cytokine in the tight regulation of the immune response, to minimize pathology during infection.

IL - 10 expression by Th1 cells has been reported to regulate the immune response in leishmaniasis and toxoplasmosis.	"IL - 10	0	7	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, in many situations, IL - 10 is not produced by Th1 cells in response to antigenic stimulation.	"IL - 10	29	36	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Our goal was to address the molecular signals that determine whether Th1 cells develop to produce IL - 10 ( Trinchieri, 2007).	"IL - 10	98	105	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In certain viral or parasitic infections ( Anderson et al., 2007; Brooks et al., 2006; Ejrnaes et al., 2006), high amounts of stimulation may lead to the chronic nonhealing infection shown to be regulated by IL - 10.	"IL - 10	208	215	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 208, ""end_span"": 215, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, this is dependent on the induction of IL - 12 by antigen - presenting DCs.	"IL - 12	47	54	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Although IL - 10 may be differentially regulated in Th1 and Th2 cells as has been reported ( Chang et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2005), some studies suggest the existence of common pathways, but the molecular basis for these is as yet unclear.	"IL - 10	9	16	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This reinforces the fact that IL - 10 is not a Th cell - subset - specific cytokine, but instead is produced in a tightly regulated fashion during each differentiation pathway.	"IL - 10	30	37	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This provides a mechanism whereby a Th1 cell responds to extrinsic signals, reflecting increased inflammation in the tissue, to tightly regulate the production of IL - 10 so as to allow a protective response to eradicate a pathogen with minimal damage to the host and also prevent chronic infection.

The present report showed that null mutations of the mouse Sharpin gene did not affect the steady - state distribution of splenic DC subsets nor the development and phenotype of BMDC.	"Sharpin	59	66	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sharpin"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, loss of SHARPIN significantly diminished the capacity of BMDC to secrete inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide.	"SHARPIN	17	24	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SHARPIN"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Together, these results indicate an indispensible role of SHARPIN in regulating DC immunological functions, disruption of which may contribute to the development of immune diseases.	"SHARPIN	58	65	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SHARPIN"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
NF - kappaB, TBK / IRF3, and MAPK signaling are important pathways activated by LPS or poly I: C and disruption of either pathway may lead to decreased cytokine expression.	"IRF3	19	23	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IRF3"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This difference can probably be attributed to the different cells and tissues used in these studies, and may point to cell - and tissue - type specific functions of SHARPIN.	"SHARPIN	165	172	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SHARPIN"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 172, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Despite defective NF - kappaB activation in the absence of Sharpin expression, there was no significant change in splenic DC populations or expression of co - stimulatory molecules on BMDC.	"Sharpin	59	66	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sharpin"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The molecular basis by which the Sharpin mutation causes reduced NF - kappaB activation in BMDC remains to be determined.	"Sharpin	33	40	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sharpin"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Since TNFR and TLR partially share their downstream signaling cascades, a similar ubiquitin - mediated regulation may hold true for SHARPIN in LPS - and poly I: C - induced NF - kappaB activation.
