Functional inactivation of Foxp3 by genetic mutations affecting the Foxp3 coding region, as demonstrated in IPEX, or repression of Foxp3 expression by the HTLV - I - encoded transactivator protein Tax, as recently reported in patients with HAM / TSP, results in loss of regulatory activity in CD4 + CD25hi T cells [ 4, 8, 17].

To ascertain the molecular mechanisms by which Foxp3 functions to promote the regulatory function of CD4 + CD25hi T cells, we first confirmed the function of Foxp3 as a repressor of activation of NF - kappaB, previously implicated as a target of other forkhead / winged - helix family transcription factors ( e. g., Foxj1 and Foxo3a) [ 19, 20].

Although the activation of Akt and the lack of Fox01 in the lymphoma cells suggest that LMP1 affects bcl6 and GC formation through this pathway, regulation of other Forkhead targets involved in cell cycle progression, such as p27 and CyclinD2, likely contribute to malignant transformation.

Therefore, although activation of the perforin / granzyme B machinery is defective in Runx3 - / - CD8 + cells, these cells are not entirely devoid of cytolytic activity and could still effectively kill targets, possibly by alternative mechanisms such as the Fas - Fas ligand pathway.	perforin,38,46,Protein	granzyme B,49,59,Protein	Runx3,86,91,Protein	CD8,98,101,Protein	Fas,258,261,Protein	Fas ligand,264,274,Protein	"[{""token"": ""perforin"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""granzyme B"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Runx3"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD8"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Fas"", ""start_span"": 258, ""end_span"": 261, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Fas ligand"", ""start_span"": 264, ""end_span"": 274, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	train
Indeed, T - bet and Eomes both contribute to perforin expression in NK cells ( 8, 26), and Eomes induces granzyme B as effectively as T - bet in developing Th2 cells ( 7); thus, the relative roles of these T - box transcription factors vary depending on cell type.

In contrast, in the absence of STAT4, the percentage of cells expressing IFN - gamma was dramatically diminished as expected and resulted in an increase in the percentage of cells expressing IL - 4, but not IL - 10 ( Figure 2A), suggesting that STAT4 contributes to IL - 10 expression by Th1 cells.

Finally, DO11. 10 CD4 + cells that were exposed to low doses of antigen and IL - 12 during the primary differentiation phase produced high amounts of IFN - gamma but little IL - 10, but they could be induced to produce IL - 10 when both high antigen dose and IL - 12 were present during the recall phase ( Figure S4).

Our data thus suggested that IL - 10 production by Th1 cells in response to high antigen dose and IL - 12 requires ERK1 and ERK2 signaling, but not the activation of the p38 or the GSK3beta pathways.

To address whether IL - 10 production by Th2 and Th17 cells was also dependent on ERK1 and ERK2 activation, we differentiated these cells with anti - CD3 and anti - CD28 in the absence of APCs ( Shoemaker et al., 2006; Veldhoen et al., 2009; Veldhoen et al., 2006), in the presence or absence of the MEK inhibitor ( PD184352).

We showed also that like Il10 expression, c - maf expression was inhibited in Th1 and Th17 cells in the presence of the MEK1 and MEK2 inhibitor ( PD184352), whereas T - bet and RORgammat expression was hardly affected ( Figure 6D).

We provide evidence that IL - 10 is produced in canonical Th1 cells and that its expression correlates with the expression of T - bet and the highest IFN - gamma production, in keeping with our observations that high - dose antigen stimulation and IL - 12 signaling are required for IL - 10 and IFN - gamma expression.

That c - maf expression is common to IL - 10 - producing Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells and, like IL - 10, is dependent on ERK activation in Th1 and Th17 cells for its expression is of interest because c - Maf has been shown to be an essential transcription factor for IL - 10 expression in macrophages ( Cao et al., 2005).	c - maf,5,12,Protein	IL - 10,37,44,Protein	IL - 10,92,99,Protein	ERK,117,120,Protein	c - Maf,196,203,Protein	IL - 10,263,270,Protein	"[{""token"": ""c - maf"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ERK"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""c - Maf"", ""start_span"": 196, ""end_span"": 203, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 263, ""end_span"": 270, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	train
