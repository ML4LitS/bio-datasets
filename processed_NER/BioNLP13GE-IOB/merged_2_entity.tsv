First, treatment of IRF - 4 - negative lymphoid, myeloid and monocytic cell lines with the methylation - inhibitor 5 - aza - 2 - deoxycytidine resulted in a time - and concentration - dependent increase of IRF - 4 mRNA and protein levels.

Consistent with the restriction of expression to immunocompetent cells, mice with deletion of IRF - 4 failed to develop mature and functionally active B - and T - lymphocytes ( 12), and the impaired expression of IRF - 4 in CML was predominately found in T - cells ( 3).

After sequencing of the IRF - 4 promoter, it could be excluded that absence of IRF - 4 expression in any of the above cell lines was due to genetic aberrations.

However, 2 bp changes ( nucleotide - 1081, T to C and - 1068, A to C) could be detected in both the IRF - 4 - positive BV - 173 and the IRF - 4 - negative LAMA - 84, EM - 2 and K - 562 ( Figure 1B).

Accordingly, treatment of the IRF - 4 - positive cell line BV - 173, SD - 1 and RPMI - 8226 with AzadC had no effect on IRF - 4 expression ( Figure 2D).

This implied that promoter methylation may control IRF - 4 expression, but an alternative explanation may be activation of positive transcriptional regulators of IRF - 4 by AzadC ( or AzaC).

This implied that IRF - 4 transcription in SD - 1 and BV - 173 cells is associated with less promoter methylation ( in BV - 173 especially at HpaII sites) as compared with the tested IRF - 4 - negative cells.

Intriguingly, a stretch of 13 CpG sites ( # 10 - 22; R2) was detected in between these regions, which were highly methylated in IRF - 4 - negative ( mean number of methylated clones 7. 1 of 8 with 89% methylated CpGs) but totally non - methylated in IRF - 4 - positive cells ( Figure 4A and B).

To provide evidence for a direct effect of methylational status on IRF - 4 promoter activity we performed reporter gene assays with IRF - 4 promoter constructs before and after their in vitro methylation.

Intriguingly, methylation of the IRF - 4 promoter significantly decreased promoter activity in IRF - 4 - positive SD - 1 cells by 85. 0% ( Figure 5B).

The silencing effect of CpG methylation was not restricted to IRF - 4 - positive cells, since in vitro methylation led to a 92. 9% abrogation of promoter activity in IRF - 4 - negative Jurkat cells ( Figure 5C).

Since IRF - 4 expression in cell lines and CML can be induced by demethylation and successful IFN - alpha therapy ( 3), respectively, the existence of such genetic aberrations seems unlikely.

We then investigated whether the previously described down - regulation of IRF - 4 expression in human myeloid leukemias was due to a differential hypermethylation of the promoter, since the presented re - expression due to AzadC - treatment might also be a result of activation of positive transcriptional regulators of IRF - 4.

Methylation of CpG sites is a common mechanism of silencing genes in leukemia and has also been shown for another IRF, IRF - 7 ( 35) and for PU. 1 ( 36), an interacting partner of IRF - 4.

Via in vitro methylation and reporter gene assays we could clearly appoint the silencing of the IRF - 4 promoter to a methylation effect, which may thus be the mechanism of IRF - 4 deregulation in vivo.

Overexpression of Foxp3 in HEK 293T and purified CD4 + T cells resulted in a dose - dependent and time - dependent decrease in basal levels of nuclear factor - kappaB ( NF - kappaB) activation.

Deletion of the carboxyl - terminal forkhead ( FKH) domain, critical for nuclear localization and DNA - binding activity, abrogated the ability of Foxp3 to suppress NF - kappaB activity in HEK 293T cells, but not in Jurkat or primary human CD4 + T cells.

In the present study, we expanded upon these observations by defining additional requirements of Foxp3 - mediated repression of NF - kappaB activation, and investigated whether Foxp3 could target additional signaling pathways by examining transcriptional activation of NF - kappaB - dependent and NF - kappaB - independent retroviral pathogens.

Extending these results from established, in vitro HEK cell lines to primary human lymphocytes, overexpression of Foxp3 in purified CD4 + T cells from three healthy donors also down - regulated the steady - state level of NF - kappaB activation ( Figure 1D).

These results recapitulate those from Bettelli and colleagues [ 15] demonstrating that Foxp3 functions, in part, to block NF - kappaB - dependent transcription in human cell lines as well as in primary human CD4 + T cells.

Unlike full - length Foxp3, which localizes almost exclusively to the nucleus and can bind in a sequence - specific manner to forkhead binding sites, the deltaFKH mutant fails to localize to the nucleus and thus cannot interact with promoter elements or nuclear proteins [ 16].

Therefore, we utilized the deltaFKH mutant to determine whether nuclear localization ( or other function associated with the FKH domain) of Foxp3 was a prerequisite for inhibition of NF - kappaB activation.	deltaFKH mutant,27,42,Protein	Foxp3,140,145,Protein	"[{""token"": ""deltaFKH mutant"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	train
Although Foxp3 interaction with NF - kappaB presumably takes place in the nucleus, it may also be possible for a cytoplasmic Foxp3 protein to bind to NF - kappaB in the cytoplasm and prevent localization to the nucleus following an activation stimulus.

Overexpression of full - length Foxp3, but not of deltaFKH, was able to suppress activation of a cotransfected NF - kappaB reporter vector in HEK 293T cells ( Figure 2B).

These results are very interesting with respect to Foxp3 function, because they suggest that the carboxyl - terminal FKH domain, and possibly nuclear localization, are dispensable for Foxp3 function in T cell populations.

If Foxp3 functions as a repressor of NF - kappaB - dependent gene expression, then we hypothesized that Foxp3 overexpression could selectively down - regulate transcription from promoters previously shown to be responsive to NF - kappaB.

Overexpression of full - length Foxp3, but not deltaFKH, in HEK 293T cells was able to inhibit basal activation of the HIV - 1 LTR ( Figure 3A), similar to what was previously demonstrated with the synthetic NF - kappaB reporter vector ( Figure 2B).

However, directly comparing the effect of Foxp3 overexpression on the activation of these two viral promoters demonstrated that Foxp3 was more capable of suppressing transcriptional activation of the HIV - 1 LTR ( Figure 3D) compared to the mutated HIV - 1 LTR ( Figure 3E).

Previous studies by Bettelli and colleagues have demonstrated that Foxp3 can repress both the basal levels of NF - kappaB activation as well as tumor necrosis factor - alpha - stimulated NF - kappaB activation [ 15].

Since the HTLV - I Tax protein can function at multiple levels in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus to stimulate activation of NF - kappaB [ 28, 29], we hypothesized that overexpression of Foxp3 may interfere with this process.

These observations further suggest that the carboxyl - terminal FKH domain is required for inhibiting activation of NF - kappaB in the presence of Tax in HEK 293T cells, strikingly similar to the requirements of Foxp3 inhibition of basal NF - kappaB activation shown in Figure 2B.

The suppressive effects shown in Figure 4A and 4B were not the result of Foxp3 down - regulating the expression of the transfected Tax plasmid as determined by real - time RT - PCR ( Figure 4C).

These results strongly suggest that Foxp3 interacts with transcriptional regulators in addition to NF - kappaB and NF - AT, and that the carboxyl - terminal FKH domain, and therefore localization to the nucleus, are not required for inhibition of Tax - mediated HTLV - I LTR activation ( even in HEK 293T cells).

They also support our recent reports that high proviral loads, which have been shown to correlate with high Tax mRNA in HTLV - I - infected patients, are associated with reduced Foxp3 expression [ 8, 34].

Therefore, we hypothesized that Foxp3 may inhibit Tax transactivation of the HTLV - I LTR via disruption of the CREB signaling pathway.

To test this possibility, HEK 293T cells were transfected with an HTLV - I LTR or synthetic CREB reporter vector along with a control expression vector ( EGFP) or expression vectors encoding Foxp3 or deltaFKH.

As shown in Figure 6A, Foxp3 down - regulated basal activation of the HTLV - I LTR and transcription of a synthetic CREB reporter vector, suggesting that Foxp3 down - regulates HTLV - I LTR activation by targeting the CREB pathway.

Deletion of the FKH domain of Foxp3 dampened the suppressive effect of Foxp3, but did not completely abrogate suppression, as is seen with NF - kappaB - responsive promoters in HEK 293T cells.

Importantly, the mechanism of Foxp3 - mediated inhibition of CREB - dependent transcription was not due to a block in CREB - 1 protein expression, as determined by Western blot analysis ( Figure 6E).

Stimulation of CREB - dependent transcription by reagents that activate adenylate cyclase and increase cAMP levels ( e. g., forskolin) increase the transactivation potential of CREB through phosphorylation of serine 133 by protein kinase A, which permits binding and recruitment of coactivators CBP / p300 to the promoter [ 37, 38].

While Foxp3 has been shown to bind to and repress activation of both NF - kappaB and NF - AT, exactly how Foxp3 functions to bring about this affect has not been elucidated.

To determine how Foxp3 blocks CREB - dependent transcription, we examined whether Foxp3 was capable of ( 1) disrupting the recruitment of coactivator proteins and / or ( 2) preventing phosphorylation of CREB at serine 133 ( which is a prerequisite for coactivator recruitment).

Collectively, these results suggest that Foxp3 antagonizes CREB - dependent gene expression by directly interacting with coactivator p300 and interfering with its function and / or recruitment to CREB - responsive promoter sequences.

A region that may also be important with respect to Foxp3 function is the leucine zipper domain, as demonstrated by the number of mutations associated with IPEX that have been mapped in this region of Foxp3.

Because the pathogenesis of a number of retroviral - induced immunologic disorders such as HIV - 1 / AIDS and HTLV - I / HAM / TSP have been associated with dysregulation of Foxp3 expression [ 8, 45], we also examined the role of Foxp3 in retroviral gene expression.

HIV - 1 LTR activation in CD4 + T cells is critically dependent on two tandem NF - kappaB sites located between nucleotide positions - 102 and - 81 within the HIV - 1 enhancer region, whereas HTLV - I LTR activation in the presence or absence of the HTLV - I - encoded transactivator protein Tax is independent of NF - kappaB [ 18].

In addition, the FKH domain of Foxp3 was required for this inhibitory effect in HEK 293T cells, but not in Jurkat T cells, similar to Foxp3 - mediated suppression of a synthetic NF - kappaB reporter.

Foxp3 also affected two well - known functions of HTLV - I Tax: transactivation of the NF - kappaB pathway and, most surprisingly, transactivation of the HTLV - I LTR.

Previous studies have demonstrated that the HTLV - I proviral load directly correlates with HTLV - I Tax mRNA load, the frequency of immunopathogenic virus - specific CD8 + T cells, and disease severity in patients with HAM / TSP [ 47].

As the activation of the HTLV - I LTR depends primarily on ATF / CREB proteins ( whether in the presence or the absence of Tax), we investigated whether Foxp3 could interact with this additional cellular signaling pathway.

While the DNA - binding activity of CREB is, in most cases, constitutive, the transactivation potential of CREB is regulated by the phosphorylation of CREB and recruitment of CBP / p300 [ 48].

The effect of deltaFKH on basal activation of the HTLV - I LTR in HEK 293T cells was very similar to that shown for a synthetic CREB reporter, suggesting that the FKH domain of Foxp3 is important at some level.	deltaFKH,14,22,Protein	Foxp3,177,182,Protein	"[{""token"": ""deltaFKH"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 182, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	train
As observed with NF - kappaB activation, the Foxp3 mutant lacking the FKH domain was a stronger inhibitor of CREB activation in CD4 + T cells than in HEK 293T epithelial cells.

Therefore, it appears that in CD4 + T cells, the FKH domain is dispensable for the proper functioning of Foxp3 with respect to both NF - kappaB and CREB activation.

However, observing that this inhibitory effect is not absolute, a low level of viral gene expression may persist in CD4 + T cells ( in particular regulatory T cells, which are known reservoirs of HIV - 1 and HTLV - I) and result in the accumulation of viral proteins that either stimulate NF - kappaB and / or CREB activation or directly inhibit Foxp3 expression or function.

To investigate whether LMP1 affects primary B cell survival and proliferation, splenocytes were cultured in the presence or absence of IL4 and analyzed by MTS as a metabolic marker, by ethidium monoazide ( EMA) exclusion for viability, and by 5 - bromo - 2 ' - deoxy - uridine ( BrdU) incorporation for proliferation.

However, transformation and growth properties induced by EBV are associated with the upregulation of IL10 [ 35 - 38]; hence, the effects of IL10 upregulation on the growth properties of the lymphoma cells were further examined.

To address the mechanisms regulating IL - 10 production by Th1 cells in vivo, we transferred DO11. 10 cells into BALB / c recipient mice and immunized the recipients with very high doses of OVA - protein with or without added lipopolysacharide ( LPS).

For this, CD4 + T cells were differentiated for 2 consecutive weeks with high antigen doses in the presence or absence of IL - 12 throughout ( Figures 4A - 4D).

However, IL - 10 induction under these conditions was abrogated when IL - 12p40 - deficient DCs were used as APCs ( Figure 4E).

Thus, IL - 12 is essential during both primary and secondary antigenic stimulation for production of IL - 10 by Th1 cells.

Our data showed that the maintenance of IL - 10 induction in Th1 cells required stimulation with high antigen dose, which to some extent could be compensated for by the addition of IL - 12.

To ensure that only T cell signaling was being affected by U0126, we used an APC - free system in which the T cells were differentiated in the presence of increasing doses of anti - CD3 and a constant amount of IL - 12.

Low - dose antigen resulted in transcription of Il4 and this was abrogated by both high antigen doses and IL - 12 ( Figure 6A).

In contrast, high amounts of GATA - 3 mRNA expression were only observed under Th2 cell differentiation conditions ( low - dose antigen) ( Figure 6B), and this expression was markedly downregulated by both increasing antigen dose and coculture in IL - 12 ( Figure 6B).

c - Maf is therefore expressed in all IL - 10 - expressing T cell populations tested ( Figures 6B and 6C) and may not be just a Th2 cell - specific transcription factor as originally thought ( Ho et al., 1996).	c - Maf,0,7,Protein	IL - 10,38,45,Protein	"[{""token"": ""c - Maf"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	train
Our demonstration that loss of IL - 2 is accompanied by production of IL - 10 offers potential additional mechanisms whereby effector T cell responses may be dampened during chronic disease.

Using an in vivo transfer model of DO11. 10 TCR transgenic cells ( Castro et al., 2000), we showed that IL - 10 - producing Th1 cells were differentiated in the presence of high doses of OVA protein and LPS.

We showed here that this induction of IL - 10 in Th1 cells in vivo was markedly, but not totally, reduced in STAT4 - deficient T cells as observed during T. gondii infection ( Jankovic et al., 2002).

A high antigenic activation during T. gondii infection or high antigen doses delivered in the presence of LPS, as seen in our system, may compensate for an absolute requirement for IL - 12 in the induction of IL - 10 by Th1 cells.

Secondly, corticosteroids at higher concentrations increase the expression of MKP - 1, a potent inhibitor of p38 MAPK activity and thereby prevent T cell receptor / co - receptor activation of p38 MAPK to prevent the phosphorylation of GATA - 3 that is necessary for interaction with importin - alpha and subsequent nuclear import.

By contrast, changing the GG dinucleotide to TA in either NF - kappaB binding motif, as predicted, inhibited p50 / p65 binding at each site ( compare lanes 2 - 5 with lanes 7 - 10 and lanes 12 - 15 of Figure 3C).	p50,109,112,Protein	p65,115,118,Protein	"[{""token"": ""p50"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test

When THP - 1 cells were treated with the TLR2 - specific agonist Pam3Cys for 16 hours, NFAT5 mRNA levels were significantly increased in Pam3Cys - stimulated cells as compared to mock - stimulated control cells ( Figure 7A).

Multiple studies of HIV - 1 activation have shown that initial recruitment of the NF - kappaB p50 / p65 heterodimer to the HIV - 1 proviral enhancer region is crucial for HIV gene transcription ( reviewed in [ 67], [ 68]).	p50,94,97,Protein	p65,100,103,Protein	"[{""token"": ""p50"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
This hypothesis is consistent with our quantitative DNase I footprinting analysis that shows that specific disruption of NF - kappaB site I results in enhanced binding of NFAT5 to the LTR.

In the co - infection model utilized in this report, in which clinical isolates of both MTb and HIV - 1 subtype C were used to infect freshly prepared human peripheral blood cells, we found that specific disruption of NFAT5 binding to the LTR significantly impaired viral replication during MTb co - infection, indicating that even the presence of three intact NF - kappaB binding sites, which is typical for HIV - 1 subtype C isolates [ 30], cannot compensate for loss of NFAT5 recruitment to the viral LTR in the context of MTb co - infection.

Because NFAT5 expression continues to rise for at least 48 hours post - MTb infection ( Figure 2A), one possibility is that the host factors NF - kappaB and NFAT5 associate with the LTR at different stages after viral activation.

Thus, NFAT5, which is pivotal for HIV - 1 transcription in unstimulated cells [ 31], may, after Mtb infection, perpetuate viral transcriptional initiation begun by NF - kappaB and, with Tat levels also elevated, promote high levels of sustained HIV - 1 transcription.

A complex consisting of two related Ser / Thr kinases, RIP1 and RIP3, plays a critical role in the initiation of necroptosis in multiple systems [ 7], [ 8], [ 9].

Importantly, RIP1 kinase dependent activation of JNK and TNFalpha production has recently been described to be independent of its role in necroptosis [ 15].

Furthermore, the key question of whether insulin - dependent Akt activity solely provides an environment conducive for necroptosis or if Akt activation is an intrinsic component of necroptosis signaling that is linked to RIP1 kinase has not been explored.	insulin,41,48,Protein	RIP1,221,225,Protein	"[{""token"": ""insulin"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RIP1"", ""start_span"": 221, ""end_span"": 225, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test

Further data suggested that in multiple other cell types including FADD deficient Jurkat cells, RAW and J774. 1 macrophage cell lines, and mouse lung fibroblasts Akt provides a key link to TNFalpha production, but is dispensible for cell death per se.

Interestingly, while necroptosis was initially identified as a back - up form of cell death triggered by pro - apoptotic stimuli in the presence of apoptosis inhibitors [ 17], recent analysis of physiological cell death during mouse development has suggested that the loss of apoptotic regulators, such as caspase - 8 and FADD [ 18], [ 19], [ 20], leads to robust induction of necroptosis and death of E10. 5 embryos even though apoptosis is not normally induced in wild type embryos.	caspase - 8,306,317,Protein	FADD,322,326,Protein	"[{""token"": ""caspase - 8"", ""start_span"": 306, ""end_span"": 317, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FADD"", ""start_span"": 322, ""end_span"": 326, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
In contrast, TNFalpha triggered necroptosis equally efficiently in the absence of serum ( Fig. 1A), suggesting that either growth factors and zVAD. fmk or TNFalpha are required for necroptotic death in L929 cells.

To further validate the role of RIP1, we used an inactive analog, 7 - Cl - O - Nec - 1i ( Nec - 1i) ( Fig. S1A), which contains an extra N - methyl group that leads to almost complete loss of RIP1 kinase inhibitory activity in vitro [ 23].

Nec - 1i was unable to protect L929 cell death under serum condtions treated with zVAD. fmk or TNFalpha ( Fig. S1B) or serum free conditions treated with bFGF / zVAD. fmk ( Fig. S1C).

We used two bFGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( PD173074 and PD166866), and determined that inhibition of bFGF signaling strongly inhibited zVAD. fmk - induced necroptosis under normal serum conditions ( Fig. 1D).	bFGF receptor tyrosine kinase,12,41,Protein	bFGF,113,117,Protein	"[{""token"": ""bFGF receptor tyrosine kinase"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""bFGF"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test

Inhibition of Akt ( Akt inhibitor VIII) strongly protected the cells from growth factor - sensitive necroptosis induced by zVAD. fmk [ 16] as well as cell death triggered by bFGF or IGF - 1 / zVAD. fmk under serum free conditions ( Fig. 2B).	bFGF,174,178,Protein	IGF - 1,182,189,Protein	"[{""token"": ""bFGF"", ""start_span"": 174, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IGF - 1"", ""start_span"": 182, ""end_span"": 189, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test

The RIP1 kinase inhibitor, Nec - 1, completely prevented the increase in Thr308 Akt phosphorylation, while Nec - 1i did not ( Fig. 3A, Fig. S1D).

We found that the addition of bFGF alone or in combination with zVAD. fmk led to a substantial rapid and transient increase in both Thr308 and Ser473 phosphorylation of Akt as well as JNK and c - Jun at 15 minutes, reflecting the expected response to growth factor stimulation ( Fig. 3C).	bFGF,30,34,Protein	c - Jun,192,199,Protein	"[{""token"": ""bFGF"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""c - Jun"", ""start_span"": 192, ""end_span"": 199, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Significantly, the combination of bFGF / zVAD. fmk, but not bFGF alone, also caused a robust, second, delayed increase in the phosphorylation of Thr308, but not Ser473, of Akt as well as a delayed increase in the phosphorylation of JNK and Jun.	bFGF,34,38,Protein	bFGF,60,64,Protein	"[{""token"": ""bFGF"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""bFGF"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Consistent with TNFalpha inducing necroptosis independently of growth factors ( Fig. 1A), FGFR inhibitors did not attenuate TNFalpha - induced changes in Akt or JNK phosphorylation, while efficiently preventing these changes in response to zVAD. fmk ( Fig. S4A).

Furthermore, addition of TNFalpha led to comparable late activation of Akt p308 signal under both normal and serum free conditions ( Fig. S4B, C), indicating that TNFalpha signaling to Akt Thr308 is growth factor - independent.

Secondly, we saw that the ability of the Akt inhibitor to protect cells from necroptosis rapidly declined after 6 hrs of stimulation with zVAD. fmk, TNFalpha or bFGF / zVAD. fmk and no protection was observed when the inhibitor was added at 9 hrs ( Fig. 4B, C).

Consistently, we found that the small molecule inhibitor of p70S6K PF - 4708671 [ 33] attenuated necroptosis at the concentrations required to block S6 phosphorylation ( Fig. S5C, D).	p70S6K,60,66,Protein	S6,149,151,Protein	"[{""token"": ""p70S6K"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""S6"", ""start_span"": 149, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test

Under serum free conditions, bFGF alone triggered some induction of TNFalpha mRNA, while its combination with zVAD. fmk ( but not zVAD. fmk alone) caused a pronounced further increase ( Fig. 6A).	bFGF,29,33,Protein	TNFalpha,68,76,Protein	"[{""token"": ""bFGF"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Conversely, PDGF caused a modest upregulation of TNFalpha mRNA, which was not further increased in the presence of zVAD. fmk ( Fig. 6A), demonstrating that activation of necroptosis is specifically accompanied by a marked increase in autocrine TNFalpha synthesis.

Further analysis suggested that both Akt and mTORC1 contribute to the upregulation of TNFalpha mRNA during necroptosis as both small - molecule inhibition and siRNA knockdown of Akt and mTOR reduced TNFalpha mRNA levels in necroptotic cells ( Fig. 6B, C, D).

Knockdown of mTOR, rapamycin and the p70S6K inhibitor PF - 4708671 also attenuated the necroptosis - associated increase in JNK and c - Jun phosphorylation ( Fig. 6F, S6E, G, Fig. S5D).	p70S6K,37,43,Protein	c - Jun,132,139,Protein	"[{""token"": ""p70S6K"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""c - Jun"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test

In the membrane, Akt is phosphorylated on Thr308 and Ser473 by 3 - phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase - 1 ( PDK1) and mTORC2 ( or DNA - PK), respectively [ 35].	3 - phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase - 1,63,112,Protein	PDK1,115,119,Protein	"[{""token"": ""3 - phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase - 1"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PDK1"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Likewise, siRNA knockdown of PDK1 protected cells from death and inhibited Akt Thr308 phosphorylation ( Fig. S7E, F) Therefore, PI3K and PDK1 activity is still required for non - canonical Akt activation during necroptosis.

Constitutively active Akt1 ( Myr - Akt) was generated as previously described [ 37] by the addition of a myristoylation signal which provides constitutive localization to the plasma membrane and by the deletion of the auto - inhibitory PH domain ( Fig. 7A) resulting in an Akt that is active under serum free.

Under serum free conditions Myr - Akt, but not the K179M mutant, fully restored zVAD. fmk - induced necroptosis ( Fig. 7A, B).

Myr - Akt also allowed other zVAD. fmk - dependent events, including activation of JNK and c - Jun phosphorylation ( Fig. 7C) and upregulation of TNFalpha mRNA ( Fig. 7D) to occur under serum free conditions, confirming an important role for Akt at the apex of necroptotic signaling.	c - Jun,91,98,Protein	TNFalpha,146,154,Protein	"[{""token"": ""c - Jun"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
RIP1 kinase was still able to regulate Akt activation during necroptosis, suggesting that growth factors and RIP1 kinase provide two independent inputs required for Akt changes during necroptosis.

Phosphorylation of many previously described Akt substrates was increased upon the expression of Myr - Akt, but not the K179M mutant, confirming that these molecules are Akt substrates in L929 cells ( Fig. 7C).

Under serum free conditions all zVAD. fmk - induced downstream events ( cell death, JNK activation, TNFalpha production) were dependent on the over expressed Myr - Akt.

As expected, the S473D mutant, which was phosphorylated on Thr308 after the addition of zVAD, displayed only slightly reduced activity, while S473A was significantly less active in all aspects of necroptosis.	S473D mutant,17,29,Protein	S473A,142,147,Protein	"[{""token"": ""S473D mutant"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""S473A"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 147, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
S473A was unable to be efficiently phosphorylated on Thr308 possibly due to the inability of the Ala mutated 473 site to be phosphorylated and provide a docking site for PDK1 to phosphorylate Thr308 [ 39].

Strikingly, both Ala and Asp mutants of Thr308 were significantly less active in promoting cell death, phosphorylation of JNK and c - Jun, and TNFalpha mRNA.	c - Jun,130,137,Protein	TNFalpha,143,151,Protein	"[{""token"": ""c - Jun"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Furthermore, TNFalpha mRNA levels were increased in each of these cell types during necroptosis and efficiently inhibited by both RIP1 and Akt inhibitors ( Fig. 8A, C, E).

These results indicate that regulation of autocrine TNFalpha synthesis and necroptosis - associated inflammatory signaling may be a more important function of Akt pathway activation by RIP1 kinase in multiple cell types compared to its contribution to cell death.

Expression of catalytically active Akt ( Myr - Akt) in these cells restored TNFalpha mRNA production in response to TNFalpha and zVAD. fmk ( Fig. 8G) without re - establishing cell death ( Fig. S9D).

Second, our data suggested that Akt activation provides a pivotal link connecting RIP1 kinase to known downstream signaling and execution events in necroptotic L929 cells, namely, JNK activation and autocrine TNFalpha synthesis, a critical event in necroptosis in L929 cells [ 15].	RIP1,82,86,Protein	TNFalpha,209,217,Protein	"[{""token"": ""RIP1"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 209, ""end_span"": 217, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
It has been published that SP600125 is a somewhat non - specific inhibitor that may inhibit the p110delta subunit of PI3K [ 41] and PDK1 [ 42].	p110delta subunit,96,113,Protein	PDK1,132,136,Protein	"[{""token"": ""p110delta subunit"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PDK1"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Therefore, to examine the role of JNK, we switched to a more specific JNK inhibitor, JNK inhibitor VIII [ 43], and siRNAs against JNK1 and JNK2 ( Fig. S10B - G).	JNK1,130,134,Protein	JNK2,139,143,Protein	"[{""token"": ""JNK1"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""JNK2"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Thus, autocrine TNFalpha production, dependent on c - Jun, may create a feedback loop that contributes to the delayed activation of Akt.	TNFalpha,16,24,Protein	c - Jun,50,57,Protein	"[{""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""c - Jun"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
It is also important to note that we observed an overall increase in the protein level of c - Jun after treatment of L929 cells with zVAD. fmk or TNFalpha, which was both Akt and mTOR - dependent ( Fig. 6E, F).	c - Jun,90,97,Protein	TNFalpha,146,154,Protein	"[{""token"": ""c - Jun"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
These new data led us to an unexpected, but important conclusion that c - Jun is critical for necroptosis, while JNK activity may serve as a useful marker of pathway activation, but may be either redundant ( e. g. phosphorylation of c - Jun on a site other than Ser63 may occur [ 44]) or dispensable functionally.	c - Jun,70,77,Protein	c - Jun,233,240,Protein	"[{""token"": ""c - Jun"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""c - Jun"", ""start_span"": 233, ""end_span"": 240, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
This provides a link connecting RIP1 kinase to downstream signaling and execution events during necroptosis in L929 cells, including JNK activation, autocrine TNFalpha synthesis and eventual cell death.

At the same time, expression of Myr - Akt is not sufficient for the induction of necroptosis or efficient activation of JNK and TNFalpha synthesis.

Another possibility is that the increase in Thr308 results from RIP1 kinase targeting PDK1, Akt or scaffolding factors that bring these two kinases together.

Given the activation of JNK by TNFalpha and the importance of mTORC1 - dependent translational control in necroptosis, one possibility is that mTORC1 contributes to the translation of TNFalpha and forms a positive feed forward loop with JNK.

Importantly, in mouse lung fibroblasts, FADD - deficient Jurkat cells, and macrophages, Akt signaling contributed more prominently to an increase in TNFalpha synthesis, rather than cell death per se, unlike its role in L929 cells.

A recent study [ 15] has demonstrated that, in addition to its role in necroptosis, RIP1 plays an important role in mediating the production of TNFalpha.

Our results highlight an important notion that inflammation not only passively accompanies necroptosis in a variety of cellular systems by the virtue of rapid loss of plasma membrane integrity characteristic for necrotic cell death, but also that it is an intrinsic and regulated component of necroptosis due to the specific activation of TNFalpha synthesis by RIP1 / Akt kinases.

Of note, there are previous reports of combinatorial interactions between C / EBP - beta and CRE binding proteins ( CREB) and AP - 1 [ 63], and C / EBP - beta has been reported to physically interact with AP - 1, and NF - kappaB to promote gene expression of inflammatory mediators [ 63]; [ 66].

C / EBP - beta, like SerpinB2, plays an important role in inflammation, as it is upregulated by LPS and a host of other inflammatory cytokines [ 59]; [ 62].	C / EBP - beta,0,14,Protein	SerpinB2,21,29,Protein	"[{""token"": ""C / EBP - beta"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""SerpinB2"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Furthermore, C / EBP - beta - null mice are susceptible to bacterial infection [ 69]; [ 70] and SerpinB2 has been demonstrated to protect from bacterial and viral - induced cell death [ 14] - [ 16]; [ 25].

C / EBP - beta phosphorylated on T217 has been reported to rescue macrophages from apoptosis induced by Bacillus anthracis lethal toxin ( LT) [ 65], an activity that has also been attributed to SerpinB2 [ 16].

Since C / EBP - beta S64 is constitutively phosphorylated in both RAW264. 7 cells and MEFs [ 73], it is likely that dephosphorylation at this site may be a critical event during LPS - induced transcription of SerpinB2 to increase its promoter activity.
