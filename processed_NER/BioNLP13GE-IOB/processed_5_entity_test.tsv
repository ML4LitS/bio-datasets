These results indicate that RA CD4 + T cells become resistant to the immunosuppressive effect of IL - 10 before migration into synovial tissue, and this impaired IL - 10 signaling may be associated with sustained signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activation and suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 induction.

The continuing emergence of activated CD4 + T cells, even though few in number, may be crucial in sustaining the activation of macrophages and synovial fibroblasts through cell surface signaling by means of cell surface CD69 and CD11, as well as the release of proinflammatory Th1 cytokines such as interferon gamma ( IFN) - gamma and IL - 17 [ 21, 22].

We thus compared the levels of IFN - gamma production by CD4 + T cells after CD3 and CD28 costimulation in the presence of 1 ng / ml IL - 10 in RA patients with active disease ( multiple inflammatory joints, CRP level > = 10 mg / l) and inactive disease ( in remission, CRP level < 10 mg / l) [ 26] and in healthy controls.

Since IL - 6 is also abundant in sera of active RA patients, frequently detected at > 1 ng / ml [ 27], we examined whether persistent exposure of CD4 + T cells to high concentrations of IL - 6 in the blood circulation was responsible for their sustained STAT3 activation and resistance to IL - 10 inhibition in active RA.

The lack of STAT1 activation by RA serum suggests that much higher concentrations of IL - 6 may be required for STAT1 activation as compared with STAT3 activation, or that inhibitors of STAT1 signaling may be present in RA serum.

After preincubation with or without 10 ng / ml IL - 6 for 36 hours, normal CD4 + T cells were stimulated by CD3 and CD28 costimulation in the presence or absence of 1 ng / ml IL - 10 for 36 hours, and the IFN - gamma production was measured by ELISA.

IL - 6 pretreatment of normal cells reduced IL - 10 - mediated inhibition of IFN - gamma production ( Fig. 5b), indicating that high concentrations of IL - 6 could modulate T - cell responsiveness to IL - 10.

On the contrary, SOCS1 is able to partially inhibit IL - 10 - mediated STAT3 activation and cellular responses, as well as IFN - gamma - mediated STAT1 activation [ 32].

In the present study, we found that PB CD4 + T cells from patients with active RA, in the presence of IL - 10, are able to produce higher levels of IFN - gamma after CD3 and CD28 costimulation than normal CD4 + T cells.

This direct effect also may be limited in active RA patients, because their PB CD4 + T cells showed a defective IL - 10 inhibition of CD28 - costimulated production of both IFN - gamma and IL - 2.

This impaired IL - 10 signaling is probably induced by chronic exposure to immune complexes in vivo, because both cell surface IL - 10R1 expression and IL - 10 - induced Jak1 activation are suppressed in IFN - gamma - primed macrophages by a protein kinase C - dependent pathway following ligation of the IgG Fc gamma receptor [ 14].

Furthermore, dendritic cells from RA synovial fluids are resistant to the immunoregulatory effect of IL - 10 due to decreased transport of intracellular IL - 10R1 in the presence of proinflammatory cytokine stimuli such as TNF - alpha, IL - 1, and granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor [ 15].

We have demonstrated that the resistance of RA CD4 + T cells to IL - 10 may be associated with defective IL - 10 - dependent STAT3 activation, but not with IL - 10R1 expression.

Consistent with this notion, IL - 6 was the major STAT3 - activating factor contained in the serum of active RA patients, and the responsiveness to IL - 10 was suppressed in normal CD4 + T cells after 36 hours of incubation with IL - 6.

In an autocrine fashion, IL - 10 may persistently stimulate STAT3 activation and IFN - gamma can induce SOCS1 protein as a crosstalk inhibitor of IL - 10 signaling [ 32].

Recent studies with mice lacking SOCS3 or SOCS1 revealed that SOCS3 is a negative regulator of IL - 6 signaling but not of IL - 10 signaling.

As expected, an inhibition of NFkappaB via CAPE [ 35] and CyA, NFAT via CyA and NFIL - 6 via CHX [ 36] could not be overruled by GP, leading to a down - regulated binding activity of the transcription factors to the IL - 1RA sites, and a reduction of IL - 1RA mRNA and IL - 1RA protein levels ( Fig. 7).

A GP - mediated IL - 8 transcription based upon a cooperation between transactivated NFkappaB p65 and NFIL - 6 [ 13, 39] or NFATc2 dimer binding to the IL - 8kappaB site [ 38] seems also possible.

The differential decrease of NFkappaB, NFAT and NFIL - 6 binding to sites in the IL - 1RA promoter as well as of IL - 1RA mRNA and protein induced by selective inhibitors prior to GP treatment might suggest that these steps are linked to each other and necessary for induction of IL - 1RA ( Fig. 7).

TRAF2 / 5 and cIAP1 / 2 are good candidates for RIP1 ubiquitination, but the specific role of each is still unclear.

The polyubiquitin chains on RIP1 are believed to create a scaffold to recruit the IKK and TAK1 complex via the ubiquitin - binding proteins NEMO and TAB1 / 2, respectively.

Receptor ligation has been shown not only to remove TRAF3 from this complex by recruiting it to the receptor, but also to attract TRAF2 and cIAP1 / 2, which are essential for subsequent TRAF3 degradation.

A20 ( also known as TNFAIP3) is a ubiquitin - editing protein that negatively regulates NF - kappaB - dependent gene expression in response to different immune - activating stimuli, including TNF, IL - 1 and antigens, and the triggering of TLRs and the nucleotide - binding oligomerisation domain - containing 2 receptor ( reviewed in [ 37]).

A20 is believed to inhibit NF - kappaB function by deubiquitinating specific NF - kappaB signalling molecules, such as RIP1, RIP2, TRAF6 and MALT1, which disrupts specific protein - protein interactions [ 38 - 41] ( Figure 1).

Because TNF and IL - 1beta are known to mediate synovitis, pannus formation, and erosion of cartilage and bone in RA, the decreased serum levels of TNF and IL - 1beta in A20 - transduced mice might explain the beneficial effects in the clinical, pathological, and radiological findings.

As A20 is required for termination of TNF - induced signals, and TNF is the primary inflammatory cytokine in RA, these findings reveal A20 as a candidate susceptibility locus for RA.

As for A20, ABIN - 1 also strongly inhibits TNF - induced apoptosis [ 58], and ABIN - 1 deficient mice die embryonically due to TNF - dependent foetal liver apoptosis [ 56].

Using oligonucleotide microarray analysis, ABIN - 1 was identified among TNF - induced genes in human synoviocytes, and high levels of ABIN - 1 mRNA were detected in RA tissue biopsies, indicating a potential role for ABIN - 1, together with A20, in the negative feedback regulation of NF - kappaB signalling and the pathogenesis of RA [ 59].

miR - 146a / b and miR - 155 are of particular interest for inflammatory signalling to NF - kappaB, since these miRNAs can be induced by inflammatory stimuli such as IL - 1beta, TNF and TLRs [ 78, 79].

K63 - linked polyubiquitination of TRAFs, RIP1 and IRAK1, is recognised by NEMO and TAB proteins, resulting in the recruitment and activation of respectively IKK2 and TAK1.

Upon ligand binding, the CARD domains of RIG - I associate with the CARD domain of the MAVS ( also termed IPS - 1, VISA, Cardif) adaptor protein, which subsequently translocates to and inserts in the outer mitochondrial membrane via its C - terminal transmembrane domain [ 17] - [ 20].

Additionally, the attachment of K48 - specific polyubiquitin chains to the IRF3 and IRF7 transcription factors by E3s such as RAUL [ 34], TRIM21 [ 35] and RBCK1 [ 36] further dampens antiviral signal transduction.

Similarly, we show that A20 overexpression in HEK293T cells prevents NF - kappaB - and IRF3 - dependent luciferase reporter gene activation induced by transfection of a truncated constitutive active form of RIG - I [ 53], corresponding to only the two N - terminal CARD domains of RIG - I [ RIG - I ( 2CARD)] ( figure 1A, left and middle graph).

To investigate C / EBP - beta phosphorylation sites that may be important for LPS - stimulated SerpinB2 proximal promoter activity ( Fig. 8B), we co - expressed several C / EBP - beta phospho - acceptor mutants in which the critical threonine or serine residue was mutated to an alanine, along with the pGLmP - 539 murine SerpinB2 luciferase reporter in Cebpb - / - MEFs.

Re - expression of wild - type C / EBP - beta in Cebpb - / - MEFs significantly stimulated SerpinB2 luciferase reporter gene expression in the presence of LPS by ~ 3 fold ( Fig. 8C, left), confirming the importance of C / EBP - beta to LPS - induced SerpinB2 gene transcription.

C / EBP - betaT188A - transfected MEFs exhibited SerpinB2 promoter activity similar to that of wild - type C / EBP - beta - transfected MEFs, whereas the expression of C / EBP - betaS64A potentiated SerpinB2 promoter activity in response to LPS ( Fig. 8C, right).

Cebpb - / - MEFs were co - transfected with expression plasmids encoding wild - type C / EBP - beta or the indicated C / EBP - beta phospho - acceptor mutants, along with the pGLmP - 539 SerpinB2 promoter - luciferase reporter and beta - galactosidase reporter plasmids, and stimulated with LPS for 4 hrs.
