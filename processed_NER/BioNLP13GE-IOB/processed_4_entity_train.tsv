Although the bcr - abl translocation has been shown to be the causative genetic aberration in chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML), there is mounting evidence that the deregulation of other genes, such as the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 4 ( IRF - 4), is also implicated in the pathogenesis of CML.

The primary antibodies were goat anti - IRF - 4 / ICSAT ( M - 17) ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and mouse anti - beta - actin ( AC - 74) ( Sigma).

In general, the methylational status ranged from one cell line with a nearly non - methylated IRF - 4 promoter ( SD - 1, IRF - 4 - positive) to a completely methylated IRF - 4 promoter in CML - T1 ( IRF - 4 - negative).	"IRF - 4	94	101	Protein"	"IRF - 4	121	128	Protein"	"IRF - 4	168	175	Protein"	"IRF - 4	199	206	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 168, ""end_span"": 175, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 199, ""end_span"": 206, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It has been shown that NFkappaB elements play an important role in IRF - 4 induction as IRF - 4 expression depends on binding of the transactivator c - Rel to these elements in the IRF - 4 promoter ( 31, 37).	"IRF - 4	67	74	Protein"	"IRF - 4	88	95	Protein"	"c - Rel	148	155	Protein"	"IRF - 4	181	188	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""c - Rel"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 155, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 181, ""end_span"": 188, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
But in contrast to IRF - 4, the loss of this IRF could not be reverted in ICSBP - negative cell lines ( EM - 2, CML - T1, K - 562 and LAMA - 84) by treatment with AzadC ( Figure 6) and AzadC has no effect on ICSBP levels in ICSBP - positive U - 937 cells ( Figure 6).

IRF - 4, similar to many other classical tumor suppressor genes p15INK4b, p16INK4a or p53, may thus be a subject of alterations in the promoter methylation status leading to expression changes, which might contribute to the initiation and / or progression of cancer.

In multiple myeloma ( MM) a translocation on chromosome 14q was reported to lead to a fusion gene of immunoglobulin heavy - chain ( IgH) and IRF - 4 resulting in a subsequent overexpression of IRF - 4 ( 48, 49).	"immunoglobulin heavy - chain	101	129	Protein"	"IgH	132	135	Protein"	"IRF - 4	141	148	Protein"	"IRF - 4	193	200	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""immunoglobulin heavy - chain"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IgH"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 193, ""end_span"": 200, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Down - regulation of IRF - 4 may promote leukemogenesis in myeloid cell context ( 3), which was recently confirmed in IRF - 4 - / - ICSBP - / - double knock - out mice ( 53), while IRF - 4 up - regulation may induce a growth advantage in lymphomas or MM ( 48).	"IRF - 4	21	28	Protein"	"IRF - 4	118	125	Protein"	"ICSBP	132	137	Protein"	"IRF - 4	181	188	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ICSBP"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 181, ""end_span"": 188, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Taken together, our data suggest that IRF - 4 promoter methylation regulates IRF - 4 expression, and that aberrant expression of IRF - 4 in certain types of leukemia may be a consequence of IRF - 4 promoter hypermethylation.	"IRF - 4	38	45	Protein"	"IRF - 4	77	84	Protein"	"IRF - 4	129	136	Protein"	"IRF - 4	190	197	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 190, ""end_span"": 197, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Finally, comparison of the percent Foxp3 + CD4 + CD25 + T cells to the HTLV - I proviral load in HTLV - I - infected asymptomatic carriers and patients with HTLV - I - associated myelopathy / tropical spastic paraparesis suggested that high Foxp3 expression is associated with low proviral load and absence of disease.	"Foxp3	35	40	Protein"	"CD4	43	46	Protein"	"CD25	49	53	Protein"	"Foxp3	241	246	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD25"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 241, ""end_span"": 246, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To define the requirements of Foxp3 with respect to inhibition of NF - kappaB - dependent transcription, we utilized a mutant of Foxp3 lacking the FKH domain ( Figure 2A) [ 16], similar to the scurfy mutant Foxp3 of mice, and a mutant Foxp3 protein from a patient with IPEX [ 4, 11, 14, 17].	"Foxp3	30	35	Protein"	"Foxp3	129	134	Protein"	"Foxp3	207	212	Protein"	"Foxp3	235	240	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 207, ""end_span"": 212, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 235, ""end_span"": 240, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Western blot analysis of NF - kappaB p65 expression demonstrated that Foxp3 and deltaFKH does not block NF - kappaB activation at the level of p65 protein expression ( Figure 2E).	"p65	37	40	Protein"	"Foxp3	70	75	Protein"	"deltaFKH	80	88	Protein"	"p65	143	146	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""deltaFKH"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Since Foxp3 is expressed almost exclusively within CD4 + CD25 + T cells, a major viral reservoir for HTLV - I [ 33], it was important to determine whether there was an association between Foxp3 and HTLV - I replication in infected patients.	"Foxp3	6	11	Protein"	"CD4	51	54	Protein"	"CD25	57	61	Protein"	"Foxp3	188	193	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD25"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 188, ""end_span"": 193, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, Foxp3 failed to markedly affect transcriptional activation of Gal4 - BD - c - Jun ( c - Jun has also been demonstrated to bind to the HTLV - I LTR) and Gal4 - BD - Tax ( see Figure 5).	"Foxp3	9	14	Protein"	"Gal4 - BD - c - Jun	71	90	Protein"	"c - Jun	93	100	Protein"	"Gal4 - BD - Tax	161	176	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Gal4 - BD - c - Jun"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""c - Jun"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Gal4 - BD - Tax"", ""start_span"": 161, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, our data suggest that Foxp3 may interfere with CREB signaling at an upstream event, such as phosphorylation of CREB or recruitment / function of coactivator proteins CREB - binding protein ( CBP) / p300.	"Foxp3	33	38	Protein"	"CREB - binding protein	177	199	Protein"	"CBP	202	205	Protein"	"p300	209	213	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CREB - binding protein"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 199, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CBP"", ""start_span"": 202, ""end_span"": 205, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p300"", ""start_span"": 209, ""end_span"": 213, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The functional interaction between Foxp3 and CREB did not affect the DNA - binding activity of CREB - 1, but did show a modest decrease in activating transcription factor 2 ( ATF - 2) DNA - binding activity in the presence of forskolin as determined by transcription factor ELISA ( Figure 7B).	"Foxp3	35	40	Protein"	"CREB - 1	95	103	Protein"	"activating transcription factor 2	139	172	Protein"	"ATF - 2	175	182	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CREB - 1"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""activating transcription factor 2"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 172, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ATF - 2"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 182, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Foxp3, again, repressed basal levels of Gal4 - BD - CREB - 1 activation by more than 2 - fold, while effectively neutralizing Gal4 - BD - CREB - 1 activation in the presence of p300.	"Foxp3	0	5	Protein"	"Gal4 - BD - CREB - 1	40	60	Protein"	"Gal4 - BD - CREB - 1	126	146	Protein"	"p300	177	181	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Gal4 - BD - CREB - 1"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Gal4 - BD - CREB - 1"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p300"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 181, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, when we attempted to determine whether Foxp3 could physically interact with the coactivator protein p300, we found that p300 immunoprecipitated Foxp3 when both proteins were overexpressed in HEK 293T cells ( Figure 7D).	"Foxp3	48	53	Protein"	"p300	109	113	Protein"	"p300	129	133	Protein"	"Foxp3	153	158	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p300"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p300"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, Tax - mediated transactivation of the HTLV - I LTR was inhibited by overexpression of both full - length Foxp3 as well as deltaFKH in both HEK 293T cells and CD4 + T cells.	"Tax	9	12	Protein"	"Foxp3	114	119	Protein"	"deltaFKH	131	139	Protein"	"CD4	167	170	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Tax"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""deltaFKH"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 167, ""end_span"": 170, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We demonstrated that Foxp3 did not directly affect the functioning of Tax, but rather Foxp3 targeted the transcription factors required for Tax transactivation ( i. e., NF - kappaB and a then - unknown cellular factor, which we identified in this study as CREB).	"Foxp3	21	26	Protein"	"Tax	70	73	Protein"	"Foxp3	86	91	Protein"	"Tax	140	143	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Tax"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Tax"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Importantly, we demonstrated that HTLV - I - infected individuals with the highest levels of Foxp3 protein expression within the CD4 + CD25 + T cells population exhibited lower proviral loads than did individuals with the lowest levels of Foxp3 protein expression.	"Foxp3	93	98	Protein"	"CD4	129	132	Protein"	"CD25	135	139	Protein"	"Foxp3	239	244	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD25"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 239, ""end_span"": 244, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
With respect to HTLV - I LTR activity, while full - length Foxp3 inhibited both basal and Tax - dependent transcription by ~ 50%, deltaFKH appeared less effective in suppressing basal activation ( ~ 25% inhibition) compared to Tax - dependent activation ( ~ 50% inhibition).

NF - kappaB p65 and CREB - 1 were detected using rabbit anti - human polyclonal ( p65) or monoclonal antibody ( CREB - 1; 48H2) ( Cell Signaling Technology).

In B lymphocytes, LMP1 mimics CD40 signaling, and both LMP1 and CD40 are essential for EBV - mediated B cell transformation [ 9 - 11].	"LMP1	18	22	Protein"	"CD40	30	34	Protein"	"LMP1	55	59	Protein"	"CD40	64	68	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD40"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD40"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
LMP1 and CD40 interact with the same tumor necrosis factor receptor - associated factors ( TRAFs) leading to activation of NFkappaB, c - Jun N terminal kinase ( JNK), and p38 MAPK signaling pathways [ 12 - 16].

In contrast, both LMP1 - positive and - negative lymphoma cells were independent of IL4 co - stimulation for survival and proliferation in vitro with a complete absence of activated Stat6, the IL4 target.

Immunoblot analysis indicated that LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes and wild - type and LMP1 transgenic lymphoma cells had corresponding increased levels of phosphorylated alpha and beta isoforms of activated Stat3, a target of the IL10 receptor ( Figure 5B).

To determine if Akt signaling is activated in LMP1 transgenic mice, pAkt and several of its targets were assessed by immunoblotting of splenic CD19 + MACS - purified B cells.

LMP1 transgenic B cells had increased levels of pAkt compared to wild - type lymphocytes; however, progression to lymphoma in both LMP1 - positive and - negative lymphoma cells did not further increase pAkt levels.	"LMP1	0	4	Protein"	"pAkt	48	52	Protein"	"LMP1	131	135	Protein"	"pAkt	202	206	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pAkt"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pAkt"", ""start_span"": 202, ""end_span"": 206, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The Akt target glycogen synthase kinase 3 ( GSK3) is inactivated by phosphorylation; however, increased phosphorylated GSK3 was not detected in the transgenic lymphocytes and was almost absent in the lymphoma samples ( Figure 6A).

Activated p - mTOR was not increased in LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes or lymphoma cells, indicating that this pathway is not affected by LMP1 - induced Akt activation and does not contribute to lymphoma development ( Figure 6B).	"p - mTOR	10	18	Protein"	"LMP1	40	44	Protein"	"LMP1	135	139	Protein"	"Akt	150	153	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""p - mTOR"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Akt"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
LMP1 - transformed rodent fibroblasts have decreased expression of p27, upregulation of Cdk2, and subsequent phosphorylation and inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene Rb [ 45].	"LMP1	0	4	Protein"	"p27	67	70	Protein"	"Cdk2	88	92	Protein"	"Rb	171	173	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p27"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Cdk2"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 171, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
LMP1 transgenic B cells had enhanced levels of pRb with concomitant stabilization of total Rb levels and Cdk2 compared to wild - type B lymphocytes ( Figure 6C).	"LMP1	0	4	Protein"	"pRb	47	50	Protein"	"Rb	91	93	Protein"	"Cdk2	105	109	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pRb"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Cdk2"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Progression to lymphoma in both wild - type and LMP1 transgenic lymphoma cells led to increased levels of Rb, correspondingly high levels of Cdk2, and decreased levels of p27 ( Figure 6C).	"LMP1	48	52	Protein"	"Rb	106	108	Protein"	"Cdk2	141	145	Protein"	"p27	171	174	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Cdk2"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p27"", ""start_span"": 171, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These data indicate that the Rb pathway is deregulated in LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes and that lymphoma cells are distinguished by loss of FoxO1 and decreased p27.	"Rb	29	31	Protein"	"LMP1	58	62	Protein"	"FoxO1	139	144	Protein"	"p27	159	162	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Rb"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FoxO1"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p27"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 162, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
A second reported inhibitor of Stat3, AG490, had no effect on growth ( Figure 7), but activation of Akt, Stat3, or levels of IkappaBalpha were also not affected ( Figure 8).	"Stat3	31	36	Protein"	"Akt	100	103	Protein"	"Stat3	105	110	Protein"	"IkappaBalpha	125	137	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Stat3"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Akt"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Stat3"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IkappaBalpha"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These findings suggest that inhibition of Stat3 can induce cell death in LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes and lymphoma cells, but Stat3 inhibition also has considerable crossover effects on Akt and NFkappaB signaling.	"Stat3	42	47	Protein"	"LMP1	73	77	Protein"	"Stat3	125	130	Protein"	"Akt	185	188	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Stat3"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Stat3"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Akt"", ""start_span"": 185, ""end_span"": 188, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
LMP1 has also been shown to activate JNK and p38 MAPK pathways [ 13, 48], and LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes were mildly susceptible to growth inhibition by SB202190, an inhibitor of p38 MAPK, but not U0126, an inhibitor of MEK1 / 2 activity.	"LMP1	0	4	Protein"	"LMP1	78	82	Protein"	"MEK1	221	225	Protein"	"2	228	229	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""MEK1"", ""start_span"": 221, ""end_span"": 225, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""2"", ""start_span"": 228, ""end_span"": 229, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The lymphomas were marked by the upregulation of IL10, constitutive activation of Stat3 signaling, and a requirement for activation of Akt, NFkappaB, and Stat3 pathways ( Figures 5 and 7).	"IL10	49	53	Protein"	"Stat3	82	87	Protein"	"Akt	135	138	Protein"	"Stat3	154	159	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL10"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Stat3"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Akt"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Stat3"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 159, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This suggests that although Stat3 is constitutively activated in the lymphoma cells, the induction of IL10 may further enhance Stat3 activation or may contribute to other IL10 - responsive signaling pathways.	"Stat3	28	33	Protein"	"IL10	102	106	Protein"	"Stat3	127	132	Protein"	"IL10	171	175	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Stat3"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL10"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Stat3"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL10"", ""start_span"": 171, ""end_span"": 175, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
NFkappaB and PI3K signaling are crucial for CD40 - induced proliferation, and mice deficient for cRel or the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K are unresponsive to mitogenic stimuli, including CD40 ligation [ 66 - 68].	"CD40	44	48	Protein"	"cRel	97	101	Protein"	"p85	109	112	Protein"	"CD40	189	193	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CD40"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""cRel"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p85"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD40"", ""start_span"": 189, ""end_span"": 193, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Our observations suggest that similar to CD40 - induced proliferation, LMP1 induces proliferation through PI3K - mediated activation of Akt and activation of NFkappaB components such as cRel.

Naive CD8 + T cells differentiate into effector CTLs with the ability to lyse antigen - bearing target cells by exocytosis of lytic granules containing perforin and granzymes, and to produce inflammatory cytokines such as IFN - gamma and TNF upon restimulation through the TCR ( 1, 2).

In this study, we have used in vitro systems such as those developed to study CD4 + T cell differentiation to define the molecular basis of effector CTL differentiation ( 5, 6). The T - box transcription factors Eomesodermin ( Eomes) and T - bet are needed for important aspects of effector and memory CTL differentiation ( 7).	"CD4	78	81	Protein"	"Eomesodermin	212	224	Protein"	"Eomes	227	232	Protein"	"T - bet	238	245	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Eomesodermin"", ""start_span"": 212, ""end_span"": 224, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Eomes"", ""start_span"": 227, ""end_span"": 232, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""T - bet"", ""start_span"": 238, ""end_span"": 245, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Runx3 and perforin mRNA are expressed by double - positive ( DP) thymocytes and CD8 + single - positive ( SP) thymocytes but not in CD4 + SP cells ( 14).

Although Runx3 is not expressed in naive CD4 + T cells, its expression is up - regulated during Th1 cell differentiation, and Runx3 influences Th1 cell differentiation and function through direct regulation of theIl4andIfngcytokine genes ( 15, 16).	"Runx3	9	14	Protein"	"CD4	41	44	Protein"	"Runx3	126	131	Protein"	"theIl4andIfngcytokine	210	231	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Runx3"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Runx3"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""theIl4andIfngcytokine"", ""start_span"": 210, ""end_span"": 231, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
T - bet mRNA expression slightly preceded the expression of GzmB mRNA; similarly, Eomes mRNA and protein were expressed ~ 1 d ahead of the reexpression of perforin mRNA and protein, respectively ( Fig. 1, B and D).	"T - bet	0	7	Protein"	"GzmB	60	64	Protein"	"Eomes	82	87	Protein"	"perforin	155	163	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""T - bet"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GzmB"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Eomes"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""perforin"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 163, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
T - bet is required early for IFN - gamma production, and our data suggested that Eomes might not function during this early period but rather might contribute later to the control of perforin expression.	"T - bet	0	7	Protein"	"IFN - gamma	30	41	Protein"	"Eomes	82	87	Protein"	"perforin	184	192	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""T - bet"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IFN - gamma"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Eomes"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""perforin"", ""start_span"": 184, ""end_span"": 192, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As expected, Eo - VP16 also rescued the early defect in IFN - gamma production observed in T - bet - deficient CD8 + T cells ( Fig. 2 D).	"Eo - VP16	13	22	Protein"	"IFN - gamma	56	67	Protein"	"T - bet	91	98	Protein"	"CD8	111	114	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Eo - VP16"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IFN - gamma"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""T - bet"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD8"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We isolated CD8 + T cells from Runx3 - / - ( KO) mice of the outbred ICR background and their WT Runx3 + / + littermates by positive selection with anti - CD8 magnetic beads ( Figs. S1 and S2, available at http: / / www. jem. org / cgi / content / full / jem. 20081242 / DC1).

Notably, Eo - VP16 did not up - regulate perforin expression when expressed in Runx3 - / - cells, even though it restored the capacity to induce IFN - gamma expression upon TCR restimulation ( Fig. 4, A and B).	"Eo - VP16	9	18	Protein"	"perforin	41	49	Protein"	"Runx3	79	84	Protein"	"IFN - gamma	145	156	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Eo - VP16"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""perforin"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Runx3"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IFN - gamma"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As expected from their defect in perforin and granzyme B expression, Runx3 - / - CD8 + T cells showed defective cytolytic activity in a mixed lymphocyte reaction ( 12).

Surprisingly, Runx3 contributed to the optimal expression of TNF, IL - 2, and IFN - gamma at day 4 ( Fig. S2).

Eomes, which is induced late and functions downstream of Runx3, may substitute for T - bet in promoting the acute expression of IFN - gamma in restimulated CTLs ( 8).	"Eomes	0	5	Protein"	"Runx3	57	62	Protein"	"T - bet	83	90	Protein"	"IFN - gamma	128	139	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Eomes"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Runx3"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""T - bet"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IFN - gamma"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Surprisingly, however, Eomes and T - bet appeared nonredundant in their ability to induce two other markers of CTL function, Prf1 and Gzmb ( Fig. 4 C).

Collectively, our data are consistent with a transcriptional network in which preexisting Runx3 cooperates with the induced T - box factors T - bet and Eomes and IL - 2Rbeta signals ( unpublished data) to orchestrate CTL differentiation ( Fig. 4 C).

As expected from their ability to up - regulate CD25, Runx3 - / - CD8 + T cells responded to IL - 2 supplementation after day 2 and efficiently expanded until day 6 of the culture period, albeit at slower rates compared with WT cells ( Fig. S1).

Although a fraction of the KO DP cells silenced CD4 expression after activation, the ratio of SP / DP cells in each enriched population remained constant thereafter, and we did not observe any major differences between these two populations throughout the culture period, indicating that in terms of effector CTL differentiation and under our culture conditions, Runx3 - / - CD8 + T cells that also coexpress CD4 are indistinguishable from those that do not.

Interleukin - 10 Production by Th1 Cells Requires Interleukin - 12 - Induced STAT4 Transcription Factor and ERK MAP Kinase Activation by High Antigen Dose	"Interleukin - 10	0	16	Protein"	"Interleukin - 12	50	66	Protein"	"STAT4	77	82	Protein"	"ERK	108	111	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Interleukin - 10"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Interleukin - 12"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""STAT4"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ERK"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The development of Th17 cells requires IL - 6, TGF - beta, and the STAT3 - dependent expression of the transcription factor RORgammat ( Ivanov et al., 2007; Stockinger and Veldhoen, 2007).	"IL - 6	39	45	Protein"	"TGF - beta	47	57	Protein"	"STAT3	67	72	Protein"	"RORgammat	124	133	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 6"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TGF - beta"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""STAT3"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RORgammat"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, the development of IL - 10 - producing Th1 cells only depended on the presence of IL - 12 together with high antigen dose and not on other soluble factors such as IL - 2 or TGF - beta or on the presence of other T cell types.	"IL - 10	25	32	Protein"	"IL - 12	88	95	Protein"	"IL - 2	169	175	Protein"	"TGF - beta	179	189	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 2"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 175, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TGF - beta"", ""start_span"": 179, ""end_span"": 189, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Naive CD4 + D011. 10 T cells deficient in STAT4 ( Ouyang et al., 1998) were cultured in the presence of IL - 12 and OVA.	"CD4	6	9	Protein"	"STAT4	42	47	Protein"	"IL - 12	104	111	Protein"	"OVA	116	119	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""STAT4"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""OVA"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The absence of STAT6 did not impair the differentiation of IL - 10 - producing Th1 cells in the presence of IL - 12 and OVA ( Figure 2A).	"STAT6	15	20	Protein"	"IL - 10	59	66	Protein"	"IL - 12	108	115	Protein"	"OVA	120	123	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""STAT6"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""OVA"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As expected, lack of STAT6 abrogated both IL - 4 and IL - 10 production by T cells developed with IL - 4 or with low antigen dose ( Figures 2B and 2C).	"STAT6	21	26	Protein"	"IL - 4	42	48	Protein"	"IL - 10	53	60	Protein"	"IL - 4	98	104	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""STAT6"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 4"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 4"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As observed in the absence of STAT6 ( Figure 2A), IL - 4 deficiency had no effect on the development of Th1 cells producing IL - 10 ( Figure 2E), but compromised the development of Th2 cells producing IL - 10 ( Figure 2F).	"STAT6	30	35	Protein"	"IL - 4	50	56	Protein"	"IL - 10	124	131	Protein"	"IL - 10	201	208	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""STAT6"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 4"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 201, ""end_span"": 208, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, our data suggested that IL - 10 production by Th1 or Th2 cells was dependent on the specific signaling pathways required for their differentiation, given that STAT4 is required for the induction of IL - 10 production by Th1 cells and STAT6 for Th2 cells.	"IL - 10	30	37	Protein"	"STAT4	165	170	Protein"	"IL - 10	204	211	Protein"	"STAT6	240	245	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""STAT4"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 170, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 204, ""end_span"": 211, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""STAT6"", ""start_span"": 240, ""end_span"": 245, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This in vivo immunization induced IL - 10 and IFN - gamma production, and the amount of IL - 10 production was enhanced by addition of LPS in the immunization ( Figure 3A) and with higher doses of OVA ( 3 muM versus 1 muM, data not shown).	"IL - 10	34	41	Protein"	"IFN - gamma	46	57	Protein"	"IL - 10	88	95	Protein"	"OVA	197	200	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IFN - gamma"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""OVA"", ""start_span"": 197, ""end_span"": 200, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Repeated high antigen dose stimulation in the absence of exogenously added IL - 12 resulted in the production of IL - 10 by Th1 cells, suggesting that repeated strong TCR triggering may overcome the need for IL - 12 for IL - 10 induction ( Figures 4C and 4D).	"IL - 12	75	82	Protein"	"IL - 10	113	120	Protein"	"IL - 12	208	215	Protein"	"IL - 10	220	227	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 208, ""end_span"": 215, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 220, ""end_span"": 227, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To determine the requirements for stability of the IL - 10 - producing Th1 cells, we differentiated CD4 + T cells for 1 week with high antigen doses with or without IL - 12 ( Figures 4A and 4C), washed them, and then restimulated them for an additional week with a low antigen dose, in the absence or presence of IL - 12 ( Figure 4F).	"IL - 10	51	58	Protein"	"CD4	100	103	Protein"	"IL - 12	165	172	Protein"	"IL - 12	313	320	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 172, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 313, ""end_span"": 320, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Signaling through the TCR with high doses of antigen induced stronger ERK1 and ERK2 activation than that induced by low antigen dose, not only in naive CD4 + T cells ( data not shown) as previously demonstrated ( Jorritsma et al., 2003) but also in CD4 + T cells restimulated with the same high and low antigen doses ( Figure 5A).

To investigate further the downstream factors involved in regulating IL - 10 production, we differentiated DO11. 10 CD4 + T cells with increasing doses of OVA, in the presence or absence of IL - 12, and quantified the expression of cytokines and transcription factors by real - time RT - PCR.	"IL - 10	69	76	Protein"	"CD4	116	119	Protein"	"OVA	155	158	Protein"	"IL - 12	190	197	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""OVA"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 190, ""end_span"": 197, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
CD4 + T cells differentiated with increasing doses of antigen did not express high amounts of Tbx - 21 ( T - bet) mRNA, unless they were cocultured with IL - 12 ( Figure 6B).	"CD4	0	3	Protein"	"Tbx - 21	94	102	Protein"	"T - bet	105	112	Protein"	"IL - 12	153	160	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Tbx - 21"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""T - bet"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 160, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Our findings that ERK1 and ERK2 activation was a common pathway required for the production of IL - 10 by Th1, Th2, and Th17 cell subsets, which differentiate along distinct pathways, such that IL - 10 provides a highly regulated feedback loop to avoid the extremes of excessive inflammation or chronic infections and also allow a protective response to diverse pathogens.	"ERK1	18	22	Protein"	"ERK2	27	31	Protein"	"IL - 10	95	102	Protein"	"IL - 10	194	201	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ERK1"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ERK2"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 194, ""end_span"": 201, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We have found that CD4 + T cells exposed to a high dose of antigen do not express IL - 10 upon restimulation, but can be induced to produce IL - 10 upon re - exposure to a high dose of antigen in the recall phase in the absence of added IL - 12.	"CD4	19	22	Protein"	"IL - 10	82	89	Protein"	"IL - 10	140	147	Protein"	"IL - 12	237	244	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 147, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 237, ""end_span"": 244, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The combination of both high antigen dose and IL - 12 resulted in the highest levels of IL - 10 production and correlated with the high levels of ERK1 and ERK2 activation.	"IL - 12	46	53	Protein"	"IL - 10	88	95	Protein"	"ERK1	146	150	Protein"	"ERK2	155	159	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ERK1"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ERK2"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 159, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It is thus likely that in T. gondii infection in vivo ( Shaw et al., 2006), the requirement for IFN - gamma to induce IL - 10, was for feedback upregulation of IL - 12 by DCs, which in turn induced IL - 10 in the Th1 cells.	"IFN - gamma	96	107	Protein"	"IL - 10	118	125	Protein"	"IL - 12	160	167	Protein"	"IL - 10	198	205	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IFN - gamma"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 160, ""end_span"": 167, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 198, ""end_span"": 205, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Costimulatory OX - 40 signals have been shown to negatively regulate IL - 10 production ( Ito et al., 2005) both in Th1 and Th2 cells, whereas ICOS signaling has been suggested to induce IL - 10 ( Ito et al., 2007; Witsch et al., 2002) in both Th1 and Th2 cells.

The cytokine profile revealed an up - regulation of the chemokine CXCL8 and the pro - inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL - 2 and IL - 6 following treatment with both PMA and HK E. coli, while the levels of the anti - inflammatory cytokine IL - 10 were not affected by PMA but were significantly down - regulated by HK E. coli.

Among the multiple TRAFs that associate with CD40, TRAF3 can function as a negative regulator of signaling, while TRAF2 and TRAF6 promote the activation of downstream signaling pathways [ 4].

These and other findings led us to hypothesize that HOIP functions downstream of TRAF2 in the CD40 signaling pathway and that HOIP is necessary for the activation of NF - kappaB and possibly other signaling molecules.

Previously, we demonstrated that HOIP is recruited to the CD40 signaling complex in a TRAF2 - dependent manner, suggesting that HOIP functions downstream of TRAF2 [ 6].	"HOIP	33	37	Protein"	"TRAF2	86	91	Protein"	"HOIP	128	132	Protein"	"TRAF2	157	162	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""HOIP"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TRAF2"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""HOIP"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TRAF2"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 162, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To test the possibility that HOIP is responsible for the recruitment of other critical signaling proteins to CD40, we immunoprecipitated CD40 signaling complexes from HOIP - deficient and HOIP - reconstituted cells ( Fig. 5B).	"HOIP	29	33	Protein"	"CD40	109	113	Protein"	"HOIP	167	171	Protein"	"HOIP	188	192	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""HOIP"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD40"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""HOIP"", ""start_span"": 167, ""end_span"": 171, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""HOIP"", ""start_span"": 188, ""end_span"": 192, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Moreover, analysis of cells expressing epitope tagged - IKKgamma confirmed that recruitment of IKKgamma to CD40 requires HOIP.	"IKKgamma	56	64	Protein"	"IKKgamma	95	103	Protein"	"CD40	107	111	Protein"	"HOIP	121	125	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IKKgamma"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IKKgamma"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD40"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""HOIP"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Overall, these data demonstrate that HOIP is required for the association of IKKgamma with CD40, and suggest that this event is coupled to post - translational modifications of IKKgamma.

The mechanisms by which HOIP mediates recruitment of the IKK complex to CD40 and by which HOIP is recruited to CD40 remain unclear.

Potentially, TRAF2 and HOIP directly interact, but it is possible that the ubiquitin ligase activity of TRAF2 [ 20] ( or TRAF2 - associated proteins, such as the cIAPs [ 21]) generates K63 - linked polyubiquitin chains to which HOIP can bind and thus associate with the CD40 signaling complex [ 22].

Although the experiments presented here focus on CD40, our results and those of other groups [ 16], [ 22] support the possibility that HOIP is important in many signaling pathways in which TRAF2 or TRAF6 are involved, including those associated with various members of the TNF receptor superfamily and the Toll - like receptors.
