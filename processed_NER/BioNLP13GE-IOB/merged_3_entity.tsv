The transcription factor Foxp3 is a 431 - amino acid ( 48 - kDa) protein expressed at very high levels in CD4 + CD25hi T cells and has previously been shown to be absolutely critical for Treg development and function [ 11 - 14].

The first evidence to indicate how Foxp3 promotes the development and function of regulatory T cells came from a report by Ziegler and colleagues [ 16], which suggested that Foxp3 could inhibit transcriptional activation by physically interacting with forkhead binding sites located immediately adjacent to critical cis - acting NF - AT binding sites found in various cytokine promoters ( e. g., IL - 2 promoter).

A recent study by Bettelli and colleagues [ 15] further demonstrated that Foxp3 could inhibit NF - AT as well as NF - kappaB activation, although the mechanism of suppression was shown to involve direct protein - protein interactions between NF - AT or NF - kappaB and Foxp3 rather than binding of Foxp3 to promoter elements adjacent to cis - acting NF - AT or NF - kappaB sites.

To determine the level of Foxp3 - mediated suppression of NF - kappaB activation over time, HEK 293T cells were transfected with an NF - kappaB luciferase reporter vector and an expression vector encoding Foxp3 or EGFP ( control vector) and harvested over 4 d.

However, NF - kappaB activation was blocked to a similar extent by both full - length Foxp3 and deltaFKH in Jurkat T cells ( Figure 2C) and primary human CD4 + T cells ( Figure 2D).

However, since Tax - dependent HTLV - I gene expression is independent of NF - kappaB [ 18], we also hypothesized that Foxp3 would not affect Tax - dependent activation of the HTLV - I LTR.

To test these hypotheses, we overexpressed HTLV - I Tax, full - length Foxp3, and / or deltaFKH in HEK 293T cells cotransfected with an HTLV - I LTR or NF - kappaB reporter vector.

Furthermore, overexpression of deltaFKH also led to suppression of HTLV - I transactivation by Tax to a similar extent as full - length Foxp3 ( Figure 4B).	deltaFKH,31,39,Protein	Tax,95,98,Protein	Foxp3,136,141,Protein	"[{""token"": ""deltaFKH"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Tax"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	train
To confirm that Foxp3 had a direct effect on HTLV - I replication, we transfected HEK 293T cells with a well - characterized HTLV - I infectious molecular clone ( termed ACH) [ 30] in the presence of full - length Foxp3, deltaFKH, or control vector.

We therefore quantitated the Foxp3 protein expression in CD4 + CD25 + T cells by flow cytometry and the HTLV - I proviral load ( a surrogate marker of viral replication) by real - time PCR from eight patients with HAM / TSP and eight asymptomatic carriers ( ACs).

Ching and colleagues [ 18] demonstrated that addition of a dominant - negative CREB expression vector resulted in nearly complete inhibition of Tax - mediated activation of the HTLV - I LTR, while blocking NF - kappaB activation by addition of a dominant - negative IKKbeta expression vector had no effect on Tax transactivation of the HTLV - I LTR.

Like NF - kappaB activation, CREB transcriptional activation was also suppressed by expression of Foxp3, and to a similar extent deltaFKH, in healthy donor CD4 + T cells ( Figure 6B).

As observed with NF - kappaB activation, deltaFKH was a more potent inhibitor of CREB activation in CD4 + T cells than in HEK 293T cells, further indicating that a cell type - specific mechanism of action may govern the function of this Foxp3 mutant.	deltaFKH,41,49,Protein	CREB,81,85,Protein	CD4,100,103,Protein	"[{""token"": ""deltaFKH"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CREB"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	train
Although these results demonstrate that Foxp3 functions as a co - repressor of CREB activation ( in addition to NF - kappaB and NF - AT), we were unable to detect a direct physical interaction between CREB - 1 and Foxp3 by coimmunoprecipitation or mammalian two - hybrid analysis ( unpublished data).

The direct effect of Foxp3 down - regulating HIV - 1 gene expression correlates well with recently reported evidence indicating that higher regulatory activity of CD4 + CD25 + T cells from HIV - 1 - infected patients was associated with lower HIV - 1 viral loads in these patients [ 46].

Transactivation of the NF - kappaB pathway by Tax was inhibited by overexpression of full - length Foxp3, but not deltaFKH, as seen with basal activation of the HIV - 1 LTR and a synthetic NF - kappaB reporter in HEK 293T cells.

Therefore, Foxp3 becomes an attractive target for the development of novel therapeutic applications directed at modulating the expression of this important regulatory protein, especially in light of recent observations that the expression of Foxp3 can also be down - regulated by HTLV - I Tax [ 8].

In fact, a higher percentage of STAT6 - deficient cells compared with WT cells produced both IL - 10 and IFN - gamma ( Figure 2A), which may be the result of the loss of Th2 cell control over a Th1 cell response.	STAT6,32,37,Protein	IL - 10,93,100,Protein	IFN - gamma,105,116,Protein	"[{""token"": ""STAT6"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IFN - gamma"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	train
However, in the absence of STAT4 signaling, IL - 10 and IL - 4 production by Th2 cells was if anything increased ( Figures 2B and 2C).

Thus, in contrast to what was observed under Th1 conditions, IL - 10 expression by Th2 cells depended on STAT6, but not on STAT4, signaling ( Figures 2B and 2C).

In vivo expression of both IL - 10 and IFN - gamma was markedly reduced but not completely abrogated in the absence of STAT4 signaling ( Figures 3B and 3C), suggesting the existence of compensatory mechanisms that were absent in the in vitro system.

Signaling through STAT6 had no effect on IL - 10 production by Th1 cells as shown by intracellular cytokine staining ( ICS) and by immunoassay in STAT6 - deficient T cells ( Figures 3B and 3C).

We next investigated whether repeated strong TCR activation is a compensatory signal for IL - 12 - induced STAT4 signaling in the induction of IL - 10 in Th1 cells.

High antigen dose and IL - 12 cooperated to induce maximal IL - 10 production ( Figures 4A and 4B), given that this combination resulted in the highest numbers of IL - 10 - producing Th1 cells.

We then investigated whether ERK1 and ERK2 activation was required for the induction of IL - 10 in Th1 cells by using U0126 ( Figure 5C), a compound that blocks downstream ERK activation.

As in the APC - driven cultures, stronger TCR stimulation together with IL - 12 led to higher percentages of cells producing both IL - 10 and IFN - gamma after 1 week of culture ( Figure 5C).

Upon addition of inhibitors to other signaling pathways, including a p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, or the GSK3beta inhibitor, CT99021 ( Bain et al., 2007), no effect on IL - 10 production was observed ( Figure S5B).	p38 MAPK,69,77,Protein	GSK3beta,106,114,Protein	IL - 10,169,176,Protein	"[{""token"": ""p38 MAPK"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GSK3beta"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	train

In contrast, inhibitors of p38 MAPK or of GSK - 3beta activation did not affect the expression of IL - 10 by these subsets ( Figure S5B).	p38 MAPK,27,35,Protein	GSK - 3beta,42,53,Protein	IL - 10,98,105,Protein	"[{""token"": ""p38 MAPK"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GSK - 3beta"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	train
Activation of the ERK1 and ERK2 signaling pathway is therefore a common requirement for the induction of IL - 10 production by Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells.

A low amount of transcription of Ifngamma was induced by IL - 12 when cells were differentiated with low antigen dose, but this effect of IL - 12 was markedly upregulated with increasing doses of antigen ( Figure 6A).

A low amount of Il10 transcription was observed at low doses of antigen accompanying Il4 expression ( Th2 cell response), and this was abrogated by increased doses of antigen as was Il4 expression ( Figure 6A).

However, IL - 12 induced a high amount of Il10 transcription as well as Ifngamma expression with increased antigen doses ( Figure 6A), again in keeping with the protein data ( Figure 1A).

Under these conditions, we speculate that Th1 cells will be induced to express high amounts of IL - 10, in keeping with reports that IL - 10 - producing Th1 cells were found in CD4 + clones isolated from BAL but not blood of TB patients ( Gerosa et al., 1999).

It is likely that IL - 10 production by Th1 cells is evoked under conditions of high inflammation and antigenic stimulation, whereas regulatory CD4 + T cells producing IL - 10 may operate to regulate the immune response under conditions in which the pathogen is clinically controlled, such as in infection with L. major ( Friedlin strain) ( Belkaid et al., 2002; Suffia et al., 2006).

IL - 10 production by Th1 cells induced by high antigen dose and IL - 12 was independent of IFN - gamma, in keeping with previous findings ( Jankovic et al., 2002).

The increased expression of IFN - gamma observed during the secondary phase will induce increased IL - 12 production by DCs and suggests that repeated high - level TCR activation feeds back to upregulate IL - 12 production by DC.

We now provide a common mechanism of ERK1 and ERK2 activation for the regulation of IL - 10 production in Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells, although each subset differentiates along a distinct and subset - specific transcriptional pathway.

Of note, a role for ERK1 and ERK2 activation in the induction of IL - 10 production has already been described for macrophages and DC ( Agrawal et al., 2006; Hacker et al., 1999).

Differential transcriptional regulation of IL - 10 in Th1 and Th2 cells has been suggested ( Chang et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2005), and extensive histone acetylation of the IL - 10 gene is detectable in fully polarized Th2 cells, but not Th1 cells ( Chang et al., 2007).

To determine whether the persistent expression of epsilony globin is due to residual primitive erythrocytes or is due to ectopic expression of epsilony globin in definitive erythrocytes, we examined the spatial pattern of epsilony globin transcripts in mouse embryos by in situ hybridization ( Figure 5).	epsilony globin,50,65,Protein	epsilony globin,143,158,Protein	epsilony globin,222,237,Protein	"[{""token"": ""epsilony globin"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""epsilony globin"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""epsilony globin"", ""start_span"": 222, ""end_span"": 237, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
These data demonstrate that the persistent high levels of epsilony are due to ectopic expression in the definitive erythroid cells that mature in the fetal liver, suggesting that there is an intrinsic defect of the epsilony silencing mechanism in Sox6 - null mice.	epsilony,58,66,Protein	epsilony,215,223,Protein	Sox6,247,251,Protein	"[{""token"": ""epsilony"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""epsilony"", ""start_span"": 215, ""end_span"": 223, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Sox6"", ""start_span"": 247, ""end_span"": 251, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
The observation that Sox6 - deficient mice ectopically express epsilony globin in liver, where definitive erythroid cells mature, suggests that Sox6 is an important regulator in definitive erythropoiesis.

Sox6 expression is temporally and spatially coincident with definitive ( but not primitive) erythropoiesis ( Figure 6), and Sox6 represses epsilony globin expression both in vivo ( Figure 1) and in vitro ( Figure 2).

At this point in development, the levels of zeta and betah1 RNA were undetectable both in mutant and WT; however, adult beta - like globin RNA levels were moderately elevated in the mutant RNA compared with WT ( unpublished data), similar to what we observe at 18. 5 dpc ( Figure 1).	zeta,44,48,Protein	betah1,53,59,Protein	beta - like globin,120,138,Protein	"[{""token"": ""zeta"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""betah1"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""beta - like globin"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
These findings suggest that Sox6 continues to function postnatally to silence epsilony globin expression and has a unique function in the regulation of epsilony - globin.

Because murine Sox6 and its human counterpart are 94% identical at the amino acid level [ 48], it is possible that human Sox6 may also be important in human epsilon globin silencing.

Thus, elucidation of the Sox6 repression mechanism and identification of other components of the Sox6 - containing complex may further our understanding of epsilon globin regulation and potentially reveal additional molecular targets for the treatment of sickle cell anemia and beta thalassemias.

A 2. 2 - kb fragment upstream of the epsilony globin initiation codon ( ATG) was used, because it has been shown that all sequences required for epsilon gene silencing are located within a 3. 7 - kb EcoRI fragment containing about 2 kb of sequence upstream of the epsilon globin gene cap site [ 50].	epsilony globin,37,52,Protein	epsilon,145,152,Protein	epsilon globin,264,278,Protein	"[{""token"": ""epsilony globin"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""epsilon"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""epsilon globin"", ""start_span"": 264, ""end_span"": 278, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test

vs. GP + TSST - 1, we observed a pronounced anti - inflammatory action of GP, as demonstrated by an about 10 - 100 fold reduced ratio at 18 h and 24 h of incubation, i. e. a higher production of IL - 1RA than of IL - 1beta ( n = 3; both p < 0. 05; Fig. 6).

In addition, our EMSA / supershift and immunoblotting results demonstrated a GP - mediated predominant binding of NFkappaB p65 and to a lesser extent of p50 to a kappaB consensus site of the IL - 8 promoter ( Figs. 1A, 2).	p65,123,126,Protein	p50,153,156,Protein	IL - 8,191,197,Protein	"[{""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p50"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 8"", ""start_span"": 191, ""end_span"": 197, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"	test
Unlike LPS or TSST - 1, we found that GP did not induce IL - 1beta, but it strongly induced IL - 1RA, suggesting an immediate anti - inflammatory potential of GP.

Of the four examined NFkappaB sites from the IL - 1RA promoter, mostly the TSST - 1 - and LPS - induced binding to the NFkappaB3 and the TSST - 1 - induced binding to the new NFkappaB consensus site seemed to be increased by GP.

So, while we observed a GP - mediated down - regulation of the LPS - and the TSST - 1 - induced NFkappaB binding to sites of the TNFalpha promoter, there was an up - regulation to NFkappaB3 and NFkappaB consensus sites of the IL - 1RA promoter.

The GP - modulated increase in TSST - 1 - induced binding to the new NFkappaB3 and NFkappaB consensus site, the NFIL - 6 site [ 32] as well as to the novel NFATP2 / 3 site may explain the synergistic up - regulation of the TSST - 1 - induced IL - 1RA production.

We think that this GP - modulated activation of transcription was reflected by the decrease of the IL - 1beta / IL - 1RA ratio following GP + TSST - 1 ( Fig. 6).

In this context, it has been postulated that in vitro a 100fold excess of IL - 1RA over IL - 1beta might control the biological effects of IL - 1 [ 46, 47].
