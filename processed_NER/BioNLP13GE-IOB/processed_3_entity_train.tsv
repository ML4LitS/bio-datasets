Whereas promoter mutations or structural rearrangements could be excluded as a cause of altered IRF - 4 expression in hematopoietic cells, the IRF - 4 promoter methylation status was found to significantly influence IRF - 4 transcription.

Recently, we described an impaired expression of the interferon regulatory factor 4 ( IRF - 4) in CML, correlating with poor response to IFN - alpha treatment ( 3).

In CML, methylation is known to regulate expression of the c - abl, the bcr gene and others ( 20 - 23), and the extent of methylation in the c - abl promoter has been shown to be associated with advanced disease ( 24).	"c - abl	59	66	Protein"	"bcr	72	75	Protein"	"c - abl	141	148	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""c - abl"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""bcr"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""c - abl"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Interestingly, the percentage of CpG methylation in the IRF - 4 promoter from IRF - 4 - positive cells was very low ( mean 24%) as compared with IRF - 4 - negative cells ( mean 94%) ( Figure 4A and Table 1).	"IRF - 4	56	63	Protein"	"IRF - 4	78	85	Protein"	"IRF - 4	145	152	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IRF - 4"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The expression of another IRF, IFN consensus sequence binding protein ( ICSBP / IRF - 8), is impaired in myeloid leukemias especially CML ( 27, 46, 47).

The transcription factor Foxp3 is a 431 - amino acid ( 48 - kDa) protein expressed at very high levels in CD4 + CD25hi T cells and has previously been shown to be absolutely critical for Treg development and function [ 11 - 14].	"Foxp3	25	30	Protein"	"CD4	106	109	Protein"	"CD25hi	112	118	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD25hi"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The first evidence to indicate how Foxp3 promotes the development and function of regulatory T cells came from a report by Ziegler and colleagues [ 16], which suggested that Foxp3 could inhibit transcriptional activation by physically interacting with forkhead binding sites located immediately adjacent to critical cis - acting NF - AT binding sites found in various cytokine promoters ( e. g., IL - 2 promoter).	"Foxp3	35	40	Protein"	"Foxp3	174	179	Protein"	"IL - 2	396	402	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 174, ""end_span"": 179, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 2"", ""start_span"": 396, ""end_span"": 402, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
A recent study by Bettelli and colleagues [ 15] further demonstrated that Foxp3 could inhibit NF - AT as well as NF - kappaB activation, although the mechanism of suppression was shown to involve direct protein - protein interactions between NF - AT or NF - kappaB and Foxp3 rather than binding of Foxp3 to promoter elements adjacent to cis - acting NF - AT or NF - kappaB sites.	"Foxp3	74	79	Protein"	"Foxp3	269	274	Protein"	"Foxp3	298	303	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 269, ""end_span"": 274, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 298, ""end_span"": 303, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To determine the level of Foxp3 - mediated suppression of NF - kappaB activation over time, HEK 293T cells were transfected with an NF - kappaB luciferase reporter vector and an expression vector encoding Foxp3 or EGFP ( control vector) and harvested over 4 d.	"Foxp3	26	31	Protein"	"luciferase	144	154	Protein"	"Foxp3	205	210	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""luciferase"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 205, ""end_span"": 210, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, NF - kappaB activation was blocked to a similar extent by both full - length Foxp3 and deltaFKH in Jurkat T cells ( Figure 2C) and primary human CD4 + T cells ( Figure 2D).	"Foxp3	86	91	Protein"	"deltaFKH	96	104	Protein"	"CD4	154	157	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""deltaFKH"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, since Tax - dependent HTLV - I gene expression is independent of NF - kappaB [ 18], we also hypothesized that Foxp3 would not affect Tax - dependent activation of the HTLV - I LTR.	"Tax	15	18	Protein"	"Foxp3	119	124	Protein"	"Tax	142	145	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Tax"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Tax"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To test these hypotheses, we overexpressed HTLV - I Tax, full - length Foxp3, and / or deltaFKH in HEK 293T cells cotransfected with an HTLV - I LTR or NF - kappaB reporter vector.	"Tax	52	55	Protein"	"Foxp3	71	76	Protein"	"deltaFKH	87	95	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Tax"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""deltaFKH"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Interestingly, overexpression of Foxp3, but not deltaFKH, suppressed Tax - mediated activation of NF - kappaB - dependent transcription.	"Foxp3	33	38	Protein"	"deltaFKH	48	56	Protein"	"Tax	69	72	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""deltaFKH"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Tax"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore, overexpression of deltaFKH also led to suppression of HTLV - I transactivation by Tax to a similar extent as full - length Foxp3 ( Figure 4B).	"deltaFKH	31	39	Protein"	"Tax	95	98	Protein"	"Foxp3	136	141	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""deltaFKH"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Tax"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To confirm that Foxp3 had a direct effect on HTLV - I replication, we transfected HEK 293T cells with a well - characterized HTLV - I infectious molecular clone ( termed ACH) [ 30] in the presence of full - length Foxp3, deltaFKH, or control vector.	"Foxp3	16	21	Protein"	"Foxp3	214	219	Protein"	"deltaFKH	221	229	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 214, ""end_span"": 219, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""deltaFKH"", ""start_span"": 221, ""end_span"": 229, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We therefore quantitated the Foxp3 protein expression in CD4 + CD25 + T cells by flow cytometry and the HTLV - I proviral load ( a surrogate marker of viral replication) by real - time PCR from eight patients with HAM / TSP and eight asymptomatic carriers ( ACs).	"Foxp3	29	34	Protein"	"CD4	57	60	Protein"	"CD25	63	67	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD25"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The percentage of Foxp3 + cells within the CD4 + CD25 + T cell population was significantly greater in ACs ( 43. 23 + / - 12. 95) than in HAM / TSP patients ( 18. 59 + / - 5. 77) ( p = 0. 0033).

Ching and colleagues [ 18] demonstrated that addition of a dominant - negative CREB expression vector resulted in nearly complete inhibition of Tax - mediated activation of the HTLV - I LTR, while blocking NF - kappaB activation by addition of a dominant - negative IKKbeta expression vector had no effect on Tax transactivation of the HTLV - I LTR.

Like NF - kappaB activation, CREB transcriptional activation was also suppressed by expression of Foxp3, and to a similar extent deltaFKH, in healthy donor CD4 + T cells ( Figure 6B).	"Foxp3	98	103	Protein"	"deltaFKH	129	137	Protein"	"CD4	156	159	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""deltaFKH"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 156, ""end_span"": 159, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Similarly, Foxp3 and deltaFKH also repressed basal HTLV - I LTR activation in primary human CD4 + T cells ( Figure 6C).	"Foxp3	11	16	Protein"	"deltaFKH	21	29	Protein"	"CD4	92	95	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""deltaFKH"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As observed with NF - kappaB activation, deltaFKH was a more potent inhibitor of CREB activation in CD4 + T cells than in HEK 293T cells, further indicating that a cell type - specific mechanism of action may govern the function of this Foxp3 mutant.	"deltaFKH	41	49	Protein"	"CREB	81	85	Protein"	"CD4	100	103	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""deltaFKH"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CREB"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Although these results demonstrate that Foxp3 functions as a co - repressor of CREB activation ( in addition to NF - kappaB and NF - AT), we were unable to detect a direct physical interaction between CREB - 1 and Foxp3 by coimmunoprecipitation or mammalian two - hybrid analysis ( unpublished data).	"Foxp3	40	45	Protein"	"CREB - 1	201	209	Protein"	"Foxp3	214	219	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CREB - 1"", ""start_span"": 201, ""end_span"": 209, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 214, ""end_span"": 219, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The direct effect of Foxp3 down - regulating HIV - 1 gene expression correlates well with recently reported evidence indicating that higher regulatory activity of CD4 + CD25 + T cells from HIV - 1 - infected patients was associated with lower HIV - 1 viral loads in these patients [ 46].	"Foxp3	21	26	Protein"	"CD4	163	166	Protein"	"CD25	169	173	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 163, ""end_span"": 166, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD25"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This series of steps allows Tax to recruit coactivator proteins CBP / p300 to the viral promoter and facilitate a high level of viral gene expression [ 24 - 26].	"Tax	28	31	Protein"	"CBP	64	67	Protein"	"p300	70	74	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Tax"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CBP"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p300"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Transactivation of the NF - kappaB pathway by Tax was inhibited by overexpression of full - length Foxp3, but not deltaFKH, as seen with basal activation of the HIV - 1 LTR and a synthetic NF - kappaB reporter in HEK 293T cells.	"Tax	46	49	Protein"	"Foxp3	99	104	Protein"	"deltaFKH	114	122	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Tax"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""deltaFKH"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, Foxp3 becomes an attractive target for the development of novel therapeutic applications directed at modulating the expression of this important regulatory protein, especially in light of recent observations that the expression of Foxp3 can also be down - regulated by HTLV - I Tax [ 8].	"Foxp3	11	16	Protein"	"Foxp3	242	247	Protein"	"Tax	289	292	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Foxp3"", ""start_span"": 242, ""end_span"": 247, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Tax"", ""start_span"": 289, ""end_span"": 292, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Our data demonstrate that Foxp3 interferes with the latter of these two processes and that the recruitment of the coactivator protein p300, and resulting transcriptional activation are blocked by Foxp3.

Recent studies indicate that LMP1 also activates phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase ( PI3K) / Akt signaling and that this activation is required for LMP1 - mediated transformation of rodent fibroblasts [ 5, 19].

The LMP1 transgenic mice ( IgLMP1) express LMP1 in B lymphocytes, and in mice older than 12 mo, lymphoma develops with increased incidence ( 40% - 50%) compared to wild - type control mice ( 11%), suggesting that LMP1 contributes to tumor development [ 26].

"LMP1	24	28	Protein"	"Akt	112	115	Protein"	"Stat3	131	136	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Akt"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Stat3"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
LMP1 was detectable in LMP1 transgenic B cells, but upon development of lymphoma, LMP1 expression was stronger in 5 / 7 lymphomas analyzed with concomitant appearance of degradation products ( Figure 1A).	"LMP1	0	4	Protein"	"LMP1	23	27	Protein"	"LMP1	82	86	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
LMP1 expression was heterogeneous with strong LMP1 staining interspersed amongst a background of cells staining weakly for LMP1.

This demonstrates that the increased LMP1 detected by immunoblotting upon malignant progression reflects an increase in LMP1 expression and an accumulation of cells expressing high levels of LMP1.

In contrast, LMP1 splenocytes had increased metabolism even in the absence of IL4, which was further enhanced upon addition of IL4.

EMA exclusion of CD19 + gated B cells prepared from two wild - type and two LMP1 transgenic mice indicated a 2 - fold increase in viability in the LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes compared to wild - type lymphocytes.

Two examples of LMP1 transgenic lymphoma cells had greatly increased viability that was not increased by IL4 treatment, indicating that the lymphoma cells are independent of IL4 co - stimulation ( Figure 3B).

Wild - Type and LMP1 Transgenic Lymphoma Cells Do Not Require IL4 and Stat6 Signaling	"LMP1	16	20	Protein"	"IL4	62	65	Protein"	"Stat6	70	75	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL4"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Stat6"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To investigate whether IL4 independence was due to endogenous IL4 expression, IL4 transcription was assessed by an Rnase protection assay ( RPA).	"IL4	23	26	Protein"	"IL4	62	65	Protein"	"IL4	78	81	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL4"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL4"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL4"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In summary, the wild - type and LMP1 transgenic lymphoma cells grew independently of IL4 treatment and did not require Stat6 signaling.

LMP1 Upregulates IL10 and Constitutively Activates Stat3	"LMP1	0	4	Protein"	"IL10	17	21	Protein"	"Stat3	51	56	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL10"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Stat3"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Strikingly, IL10, a B lymphocyte stimulatory cytokine, was increased 1. 5 - to 5 - fold in the wild - type and LMP1 transgenic lymphoma cells compared to LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes ( Figure 5A).	"IL10	12	16	Protein"	"LMP1	111	115	Protein"	"LMP1	154	158	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL10"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This suggests that the activation of Stat3 is not solely induced by IL10 or that Stat3 activation may be constitutive.

This was confirmed by immunoblot analysis such that in the presence of anti - IL10 neutralizing antibodies, pStat3 levels remained activated in lymphoma cells isolated from wild - type and LMP1 transgenic lymphomas ( Figure 5C).	"IL10	78	82	Protein"	"pStat3	108	114	Protein"	"LMP1	189	193	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL10"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""pStat3"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""LMP1"", ""start_span"": 189, ""end_span"": 193, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Exogenous addition of IL10 enhanced pStat3 activation above constitutive levels, indicating that lymphoma cells are responsive to IL10 treatment ( Figure 5C).

The neutralizing effect of the anti - IL10 antibody was confirmed by pre - incubation of IL10 with anti - IL10 antibody compared to a rat IgG1 isotype control ( Figure 5C).	"IL10	38	42	Protein"	"IL10	89	93	Protein"	"IL10	106	110	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL10"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL10"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL10"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, nuclear pStat3 was detectable in LMP1 transgenic mice and wild - type lymphomas and was detected more homogeneously in LMP1 transgenic lymphomas ( Figure 5D).

This finding indicates that GSK3 is not a target of activated Akt in the LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes and lymphoma cells.

Immunoblot analysis indicated that total FoxO1 levels were greatly decreased in wild - type and LMP1 transgenic lymphomas ( Figure 6B), suggesting that inhibition of the Forkhead signaling pathway is an important target of Akt in lymphoma development.

The effects of the inhibitors were assessed by identifying phosphorylated Akt, Stat3, and total levels of IkappaBalpha ( Figure 8).

Phosphorylated Akt, Stat3, and total IkappaBalpha were still present up to treatment with 15 muM and then were no longer detected ( Figure 8).

This finding suggests that inhibition of NFkappaB can induce cell death in LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes and lymphoma cells without significant effects on activation of Akt or Stat3.

Phosphorylated Akt, Stat3, and total IkappaBalpha were not detectable past 1 muM and at higher doses all protein levels were greatly decreased, indicative of the total loss of viability ( Figure 8).

LMP1 transgenic mice have a higher incidence of lymphoma [ 26] and the progression to lymphoma correlates with higher expression levels of LMP1 ( Figure 1A and 1B), suggesting that LMP1 is directly involved in tumor development.

Since CD40 - deficient mice have decreased numbers of IgMhighIgDlow cells, a phenotype associated with B - 1, marginal zone, and memory B cells, the mimicry of CD40 signaling by LMP1 could possibly contribute to the expansion of B - 1 cells [ 20].

LMP1 activates both the canonical and non - canonical pathways of NFkappaB signaling [ 14, 63 - 65], and inhibition of NFkappaB blocked the survival of LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes and LMP1 - positive and - negative lymphoma cells.

We have previously shown that cRel is specifically activated in both wild - type and LMP1 transgenic lymphomas, suggesting that activation of cRel is associated with B cell transformation [ 27].

The malignant lymphocytes were distinguished by constitutively active Stat3 signaling, decreased p27, and activated Akt and NFkappaB pathways, properties that are associated with promoting the growth and survival of B lymphocytes.

In contrast, all three Runx proteins are expressed in mature CD8 + T cells ( 10, 12), and Runx3 - deficient CD8 + T cells show reduced cytolytic activity ( 12, 13).

T - bet is induced quickly upon TCR stimulation and is required for early programming of cytokine production ( 17), whereas Eomes is induced later during differentiation and sustains IFN - gamma expression.

Our experiments revealed clear differences in the kinetics of perforin, granzyme B, and cytokine expression during CD8 + T cell activation ( Fig. 1).

In contrast, granzyme B ( Gzmb) mRNA was low or undetectable in naive T cells but was strongly up - regulated by day 2 after stimulation and increased progressively until day 6 ( Fig. 1, A and B); similarly, granzyme B protein was expressed by day 4 and remained high until day 6 ( Fig. 1 E).

These results show that after a strong priming stimulus through TCRs and co - stimulatory receptors in vitro, granzyme B expression and the ability to produce effector cytokines are programmed early, whereas perforin expression and cytolytic function are induced later, during the phase of clonal expansion in IL - 2.

As expected ( 17, 21), naive Tbx21 - / - CD8 + T cells produced IFN - gamma poorly upon activation ( Fig. 2 A).

We consistently observed a modest reduction in GzmB mRNA in T - bet - deficient T cells ( Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 1 and 4), which did not translate into a decrease in expression of granzyme B protein ( Fig. 2 C).

Runx3 - / - T cells also had no detectable Eomes expression; in contrast, T - bet expression was unimpaired ( Fig. 3 A).

An unexpected finding was that the two T - box transcription factors, T - bet and Eomes, are up - regulated with very different kinetics in CD8 + T cells under our culture conditions and have nonredundant roles in the subsequent expression of key effector proteins ( Fig. 4 C).

Repeated TCR triggering led to enhanced IL - 10 production by Th1 cells, and continued IL - 12 action and high - dose TCR signaling were required for the development and maintenance of IL - 10 - producing Th1 cells.

Strikingly, as the antigen dose was increased, Th1 populations driven with IL - 12 now contained higher numbers of IL - 10 - producing cells ( Figure 1A) and produced more IL - 10 protein upon restimulation ( Figures 1A and 1B).	"IL - 12	75	82	Protein"	"IL - 10	115	122	Protein"	"IL - 10	172	179	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 172, ""end_span"": 179, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Th1 cells differentiated to produce large amounts of IL - 10 and IFN - gamma and lost their capacity to produce IL - 2 ( Figure 1B).	"IL - 10	53	60	Protein"	"IFN - gamma	65	76	Protein"	"IL - 2	112	118	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IFN - gamma"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 2"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Although it has been suggested that TGF - beta can induce IL - 10 in CD4 + T cells ( Kitani et al., 2003; Schiott et al., 2000), we found that in developing Th1 and Th2 cells this was not the case ( data not shown).	"TGF - beta	36	46	Protein"	"IL - 10	58	65	Protein"	"CD4	69	72	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TGF - beta"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To further elucidate the mechanisms required for the development of Th1 cells producing IL - 10, we investigated the role of STAT4, one of the signaling pathways activated by IL - 12 ( Murphy et al., 2000).	"IL - 10	88	95	Protein"	"STAT4	125	130	Protein"	"IL - 12	175	182	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""STAT4"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 182, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In fact, a higher percentage of STAT6 - deficient cells compared with WT cells produced both IL - 10 and IFN - gamma ( Figure 2A), which may be the result of the loss of Th2 cell control over a Th1 cell response.	"STAT6	32	37	Protein"	"IL - 10	93	100	Protein"	"IFN - gamma	105	116	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""STAT6"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IFN - gamma"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, in the absence of STAT4 signaling, IL - 10 and IL - 4 production by Th2 cells was if anything increased ( Figures 2B and 2C).	"STAT4	27	32	Protein"	"IL - 10	44	51	Protein"	"IL - 4	56	62	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""STAT4"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 4"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, in contrast to what was observed under Th1 conditions, IL - 10 expression by Th2 cells depended on STAT6, but not on STAT4, signaling ( Figures 2B and 2C).	"IL - 10	61	68	Protein"	"STAT6	105	110	Protein"	"STAT4	123	128	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""STAT6"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""STAT4"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In vivo expression of both IL - 10 and IFN - gamma was markedly reduced but not completely abrogated in the absence of STAT4 signaling ( Figures 3B and 3C), suggesting the existence of compensatory mechanisms that were absent in the in vitro system.	"IL - 10	27	34	Protein"	"IFN - gamma	39	50	Protein"	"STAT4	119	124	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IFN - gamma"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""STAT4"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Signaling through STAT6 had no effect on IL - 10 production by Th1 cells as shown by intracellular cytokine staining ( ICS) and by immunoassay in STAT6 - deficient T cells ( Figures 3B and 3C).	"STAT6	18	23	Protein"	"IL - 10	41	48	Protein"	"STAT6	146	151	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""STAT6"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""STAT6"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We next investigated whether repeated strong TCR activation is a compensatory signal for IL - 12 - induced STAT4 signaling in the induction of IL - 10 in Th1 cells.	"IL - 12	89	96	Protein"	"STAT4	107	112	Protein"	"IL - 10	143	150	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""STAT4"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
High antigen dose and IL - 12 cooperated to induce maximal IL - 10 production ( Figures 4A and 4B), given that this combination resulted in the highest numbers of IL - 10 - producing Th1 cells.	"IL - 12	22	29	Protein"	"IL - 10	59	66	Protein"	"IL - 10	163	170	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 163, ""end_span"": 170, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
IL - 10 Production by Th1 Cells Requires ERK1 and ERK2 Activation	"IL - 10	0	7	Protein"	"ERK1	41	45	Protein"	"ERK2	50	54	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ERK1"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ERK2"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We then investigated whether ERK1 and ERK2 activation was required for the induction of IL - 10 in Th1 cells by using U0126 ( Figure 5C), a compound that blocks downstream ERK activation.	"ERK1	29	33	Protein"	"ERK2	38	42	Protein"	"IL - 10	88	95	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ERK1"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ERK2"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As in the APC - driven cultures, stronger TCR stimulation together with IL - 12 led to higher percentages of cells producing both IL - 10 and IFN - gamma after 1 week of culture ( Figure 5C).	"IL - 12	72	79	Protein"	"IL - 10	130	137	Protein"	"IFN - gamma	142	153	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IFN - gamma"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Upon addition of inhibitors to other signaling pathways, including a p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, or the GSK3beta inhibitor, CT99021 ( Bain et al., 2007), no effect on IL - 10 production was observed ( Figure S5B).	"p38 MAPK	69	77	Protein"	"GSK3beta	106	114	Protein"	"IL - 10	169	176	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""p38 MAPK"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GSK3beta"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
IL - 10 Production by Th2 and Th17 Cells Also Requires ERK1 and ERK2 Activation	"IL - 10	0	7	Protein"	"ERK1	55	59	Protein"	"ERK2	64	68	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ERK1"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ERK2"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In contrast, inhibitors of p38 MAPK or of GSK - 3beta activation did not affect the expression of IL - 10 by these subsets ( Figure S5B).	"p38 MAPK	27	35	Protein"	"GSK - 3beta	42	53	Protein"	"IL - 10	98	105	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""p38 MAPK"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GSK - 3beta"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Activation of the ERK1 and ERK2 signaling pathway is therefore a common requirement for the induction of IL - 10 production by Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells.	"ERK1	18	22	Protein"	"ERK2	27	31	Protein"	"IL - 10	105	112	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ERK1"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ERK2"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
A low amount of transcription of Ifngamma was induced by IL - 12 when cells were differentiated with low antigen dose, but this effect of IL - 12 was markedly upregulated with increasing doses of antigen ( Figure 6A).	"Ifngamma	33	41	Protein"	"IL - 12	57	64	Protein"	"IL - 12	138	145	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Ifngamma"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
A low amount of Il10 transcription was observed at low doses of antigen accompanying Il4 expression ( Th2 cell response), and this was abrogated by increased doses of antigen as was Il4 expression ( Figure 6A).	"Il10	16	20	Protein"	"Il4	85	88	Protein"	"Il4	182	185	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Il10"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Il4"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Il4"", ""start_span"": 182, ""end_span"": 185, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, IL - 12 induced a high amount of Il10 transcription as well as Ifngamma expression with increased antigen doses ( Figure 6A), again in keeping with the protein data ( Figure 1A).	"IL - 12	9	16	Protein"	"Il10	42	46	Protein"	"Ifngamma	72	80	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Il10"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Ifngamma"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Moreover, IL - 12 maintenance of c - maf expression required STAT4 activation ( data not shown).	"IL - 12	10	17	Protein"	"c - maf	33	40	Protein"	"STAT4	61	66	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""c - maf"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""STAT4"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Under these conditions, we speculate that Th1 cells will be induced to express high amounts of IL - 10, in keeping with reports that IL - 10 - producing Th1 cells were found in CD4 + clones isolated from BAL but not blood of TB patients ( Gerosa et al., 1999).	"IL - 10	95	102	Protein"	"IL - 10	133	140	Protein"	"CD4	177	180	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 180, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It is likely that IL - 10 production by Th1 cells is evoked under conditions of high inflammation and antigenic stimulation, whereas regulatory CD4 + T cells producing IL - 10 may operate to regulate the immune response under conditions in which the pathogen is clinically controlled, such as in infection with L. major ( Friedlin strain) ( Belkaid et al., 2002; Suffia et al., 2006).	"IL - 10	18	25	Protein"	"CD4	144	147	Protein"	"IL - 10	168	175	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 147, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 168, ""end_span"": 175, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
IL - 10 production by Th1 cells induced by high antigen dose and IL - 12 was independent of IFN - gamma, in keeping with previous findings ( Jankovic et al., 2002).	"IL - 10	0	7	Protein"	"IL - 12	65	72	Protein"	"IFN - gamma	92	103	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IFN - gamma"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The increased expression of IFN - gamma observed during the secondary phase will induce increased IL - 12 production by DCs and suggests that repeated high - level TCR activation feeds back to upregulate IL - 12 production by DC.	"IFN - gamma	28	39	Protein"	"IL - 12	98	105	Protein"	"IL - 12	204	211	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IFN - gamma"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 204, ""end_span"": 211, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We now provide a common mechanism of ERK1 and ERK2 activation for the regulation of IL - 10 production in Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells, although each subset differentiates along a distinct and subset - specific transcriptional pathway.	"ERK1	37	41	Protein"	"ERK2	46	50	Protein"	"IL - 10	84	91	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ERK1"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ERK2"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Of note, a role for ERK1 and ERK2 activation in the induction of IL - 10 production has already been described for macrophages and DC ( Agrawal et al., 2006; Hacker et al., 1999).	"ERK1	20	24	Protein"	"ERK2	29	33	Protein"	"IL - 10	65	72	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ERK1"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ERK2"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Differential transcriptional regulation of IL - 10 in Th1 and Th2 cells has been suggested ( Chang et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2005), and extensive histone acetylation of the IL - 10 gene is detectable in fully polarized Th2 cells, but not Th1 cells ( Chang et al., 2007).	"IL - 10	43	50	Protein"	"histone	147	154	Protein"	"IL - 10	174	181	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""histone"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 174, ""end_span"": 181, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We show here that high antigen dose and IL - 12 drastically downregulate Gata - 3 expression, suggesting that additional factors are in place to induce IL - 10 expression in Th1 cells, albeit transiently.	"IL - 12	40	47	Protein"	"Gata - 3	73	81	Protein"	"IL - 10	152	159	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 12"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Gata - 3"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 10"", ""start_span"": 152, ""end_span"": 159, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
ERK1 and ERK2 activation is required for IL - 10 production by all these Th cell subsets.

With regard to the expression of IL - 10 by Th1 cells, our data provide a mechanism for how IL - 10 expression is induced and then amplified and regulated by the levels of antigen and IL - 12 encountered in the environment.

In contrast, only low levels of GLepsilon expression were detected in HOIP - deficient cells stimulated with either anti - CD40 antibody alone or anti - CD40 and IL - 4.

To test this hypothesis, we stimulated A20. 2J and HOIP - deficient cells with CD154 ( CD40 ligand) expressed by HI5 insect cells [ 7], [ 8] and measured activation of the NF - kappaB and JNK pathways, two of the major transcriptional regulators activated by CD40 [ 4].

CD40 - induced activation of NF - kappaB and JNK in HOIP - reconstituted cells was normal, demonstrating that the defects observed in gene - deficient cells were due to the absence of HOIP expression.

The marked defects in CD40 - mediated cell activation and signaling displayed by HOIP - deficient cells suggested that HOIP mediates recruitment of critical components of the CD40 signaling apparatus to the receptor.

Together, these results support the idea that the cIAP proteins influence the recruitment and post - translational modification state of CD40 - associated HOIP.

Our data show that HOIP - dependent cellular responses include CD40 - mediated upregulation of CD80 expression and synthesis of germline RNA transcripts from the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus, two events that are important for T - cell - dependent antibody - mediated immune responses.

In addition, CD40 - associated HOIP could play a role in activating IKKgamma after its recruitment to the signaling complex [ 16].

The higher molecular weight forms of IKKgamma we observed in CD40 immunoprecipitates would be consistent with the presence of post - transcriptional modifications including phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which have been suggested to reduce or enhance IKKgamma activity, respectively [ 16], [ 17].

As IKKgamma appears capable of binding linear polyubiquitin [ 18], [ 19], it is possible that HOIP directs formation of linear polyubiquitin chains on a CD40 - associated factor, and it is these chains that serve to recruit IKKgamma to the CD40 signaling complex.

The apparently intimate functional link between SHARPIN and HOIP strongly suggests that at least part of the cpdm phenotype stems from defects in the regulation or function of HOIP.

Canonical activation of NF - kappaB occurs via phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBalpha leading to the release and nuclear translocation of the NF - kappaB p50 / p65 heterodimer to transactivate target genes [ 37], [ 39].

Even though the PKC family consists of 10 members, finding that PKCalpha / beta inhibitors and intracellular calcium inhibitors reduced M - CSF - induced NF - kappaB activity, suggested PKCalpha was involved in NF - kappaB activation after M - CSF treatment.

To confirm the role of PKCalpha in NF - kappaB activation in macrophages, constructs for either wildtype ( WT) - PKCalpha or kinase - deficient ( KD) - PKCalpha was co - transfected with the pNF - kappaB - SEAP reporter gene and SEAP secretion was measured.

Cell survival was also examined in MDMs expressing either WT - PKCalpha or KD - PKCalpha constructs by Annexin V - FITC and PI staining.

To confirm the role of PKC and p65 Ser276 phosphorylation on NF - kappaB activity, we co - transfected the NF - kappaB - SEAP construct with either WT NF - kappaB p65 or NF - kappaB p65 276S / A constructs in Raw 264. 7 cells, then treated cells with the PKC inhibitor Ro - 31 - 8220 in the absence or presences of M - CSF.

As predicted, expression of WT NF - kappaB p65 ( p65 WT) in NF - kappaB p65 - / - cell line constitutively activated NF - kappaB compared to cells transfected with vector control without any stimulation ( Figure 8B).

Since M - CSF - induced PKC activation regulated NF - kappaB activity via Ser276 residue of NF - kappaB p65 in primary human MDMs and RAW 264. 7 cells, we next examined if this occurred in NF - kappaB p65 - / - fibroblasts in response to a native stimulus for these cells, TNFalpha.	"p65	104	107	Protein"	"p65	201	204	Protein"	"TNFalpha	273	281	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 201, ""end_span"": 204, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 273, ""end_span"": 281, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
NF - kappaB activity was measured in the WT NF - kappaB p65 or NF - kappaB p65 276S / A transfected cells treated with TNFalpha in the absence or presence of Ro - 31 - 8220 ( Figure 8C).	"p65	56	59	Protein"	"p65	75	78	Protein"	"TNFalpha	119	127	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As expected, TNFalpha increased NF - kappaB activity in NF - kappaB p65 - / - cells expressing WT p65 and ( p = 0. 001) PKC inhibitors decreased NF - kappaB activity to the non - stimulated ( NS) level ( p = 0. 007).	"TNFalpha	13	21	Protein"	"p65	68	71	Protein"	"p65	98	101	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Notably, TNFalpha failed to increase NF - kappaB activity in the NF - kappaB p65 - / - cells expressing NF - kappaB p65 276S / A constructs.

To regulate gene transcription, NF - kappaB p50 / p65 heterodimers translocate to the nucleus from the cytoplasm, however, their translocation is not sufficient to activate gene transcription.	"p50	44	47	Protein"	"p65	50	53	Protein"	"their	123	128	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""p50"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""their"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Moreover, mutant constructs containing a point mutation at Ser536 of NF - kappaB p65 did not reduce NF - kappaB activity in cells lacking endogenous NF - kappaB p65, while the NF - kappaB p65 276S / A construct did reduce NF - kappaB activity in these cells.	"p65	81	84	Protein"	"p65	161	164	Protein"	"p65	188	191	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 161, ""end_span"": 164, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 188, ""end_span"": 191, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In our studies using conventional PKC inhibitors and dominant negative PKCalpha constructs, PKCalpha was critical in M - CSF - induced macrophage survival by inducing Ser276 phosphorylation of NF - kappaB p65 in both primary human MDMs and Raw 264. 7 cells.	"dominant negative PKCalpha	53	79	Protein"	"PKCalpha	92	100	Protein"	"p65	205	208	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""dominant negative PKCalpha"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""PKCalpha"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 205, ""end_span"": 208, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In contrast to the actions of PKCalpha activation of other conventional PKC isoforms, like PKCbetaI / betaII, appear necessary for macrophage apoptosis.

Re - expression of PKCbetaII in HL - 525 cells restores their susceptibility to TNFalpha - induced apoptosis implying that PKCbetaII is pro - apoptotic and may be required to induce macrophage apoptosis.

Expression vectors containing CMV - p65 WT, CMV - p65 276S / A and CMV - p65 536S / A were cloned in pBa5e Puro vector or pFLAG - CMV - 2 vector as described previously [ 49].

Blots were immunoblotted with PKCalpha to determine equal protein expression for the PKCalpha constructs. beta - actin served as a loading control.

( C) NF - kappaB p65 - / - cell line was transiently transfected with pNF - kappaB - SEAP with either empty vector or plasmid encoding either NF - kappaB p65 WT or NF - kappaB p65 276S / A.

In response to TOLL - like receptor ( TLR) agonists LPS and poly I: C, cultured bone marrow - derived dendritic cells ( BMDC) from WT and mutant mice exhibited similar increases in expression of co - stimulatory molecules CD40, CD80, and CD86.

However, stimulated SHARPIN - deficient BMDC had reduced transcription and secretion of pro - inflammatory mediators IL6, IL12P70, GMCSF, and nitric oxide.

Incubation with the TLR agonists for 24 hours resulted in increased expression of CD40, CD80, and CD86 on BMDC; however, there was no difference in the expression levels of these markers between WT and cpdm BMDC ( Fig. 2B).

Flow cytometric analysis shows that the expression levels of CD14 and TLR4 / MD2 between WT and cpdm BMDC were similar ( Fig. 5A).

We next determined if disrupted NF - kappaB, TBK1 / IRF3, and / or MAPK signaling may underlie the impaired cytokine production from stimulated Sharpin - deficient BMDC.

Stimulus - induced phosphorylation of the IkappaB kinase ( IKK1 / 2) is an essential step in NF - kappaB signaling, allowing phosphorylation and proteasome - mediated degradation of the NF - kappaB inhibitor IkappaBalpha to release the NF - kappaB transcription factors into the nucleus.

The cpdm BMDC exhibited similar levels of TBK1, ERK1 / 2, and p38 phosphorylation to those of WT cells ( Fig. 6).

Fibroblasts of cpdm mice are highly sensitive to TNFalpha - induced cell death and the cpdm phenotype can be partially rescued by deletion of TNF [ 7], [ 8], suggesting that deficiency of SHARPIN compromises the anti - apoptotic mechanisms in cpdm mice resulting in cell death - induced inflammatory disease.

These induced and / or intrinsic apoptotic cells can release various types of DAMPs that exert their pro - inflammatory properties by activating DC through pattern recognition receptors [ 32], [ 35], such as HMGB1 recognized by TLR2 / 4 [ 36], [ 37].

The defective NF - kappaB activation by both stimuli suggests that the Sharpin mutation interferes with the protein adaptors or kinases shared by both signaling pathways, such as RIP1 and TRAF6 [ 18].
