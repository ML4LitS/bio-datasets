In that respect, BMP - 2, - 4 and - 7 have been found to control differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells [ 5] and early T cell development [ 6, 7].

Furthermore, the expression of BMP receptors and BMP - 6 induced activation of the Smad signalling pathway with subsequent regulation of the target genes Id1 - Id4, were resolved.

To study the effect of BMP - 6 on proliferation, B - cells from healthy volunteers were stimulated with anti - IgM and / or CD40L in the presence or absence of BMP - 6 for three days.

Similarly, a combination of the soluble BMP receptors BMP - RIB - Fc and BMP - RII - Fc also neutralized the effects of BMP - 6 ( data not shown).	"BMP - RIB	54	63	Protein"	"BMP - RII	73	82	Protein"	"BMP - 6	120	127	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - RIB"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""BMP - RII"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Ramos cells expressed the type I receptors Act - RIA, weakly BMP - RIB and the type II receptor BMP - RII, but more weakly than normal B cells ( Figure 4).	"Act - RIA	43	52	Protein"	"BMP - RIB	61	70	Protein"	"BMP - RII	96	105	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Act - RIA"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""BMP - RIB"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""BMP - RII"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Total protein lysates were prepared, and the amounts of the phosphorylated forms of Smad1 / 5 / 8 were determined by western blot analysis.	"Smad1	84	89	Protein"	"5	92	93	Protein"	"8	96	97	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Smad1"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""5"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""8"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, we did not observe any significant changes in the level of phospho - STAT3 or phospho - p38 upon BMP - 6 treatment of B cells ( data not shown).	"STAT3	78	83	Protein"	"p38	97	100	Protein"	"BMP - 6	106	113	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""STAT3"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p38"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In contrast, no significant changes were observed for Id2 and Id3 mRNA, whereas Id4 - transcripts were not detectable ( Figure 7, data not shown).	"Id2	54	57	Protein"	"Id3	62	65	Protein"	"Id4	80	83	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Id2"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Id3"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Id4"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Western blot analysis revealed that the BMP - 6 - induced upregulation of Id1 mRNA also was correlated with upregulation of Id1 protein as well.	"BMP - 6	40	47	Protein"	"Id1	74	77	Protein"	"Id1	124	127	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Id1"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Id1"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In addition, the combination of soluble BMP - RIB - Fc and BMP - RII - Fc fusion proteins also neutralized the anti - proliferative effect of BMP - 6 in human B cells.	"BMP - RIB	40	49	Protein"	"BMP - RII	59	68	Protein"	"BMP - 6	142	149	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - RIB"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""BMP - RII"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Instead, a rapid and marked phosphorylation of Smad1 / 5 / 8 was revealed.	"Smad1	47	52	Protein"	"5	55	56	Protein"	"8	59	60	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Smad1"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""5"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""8"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In a parallel study, we have found that other BMPs also induced phosphorylation of Smad1 / 5 / 8 in peripheral B cells ( data not shown).	"Smad1	83	88	Protein"	"5	91	92	Protein"	"8	95	96	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Smad1"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""5"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""8"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In agreement with this, western blot analysis demonstrated an upregulation of Id1 protein, while the amount of Id2 and Id3 protein levels remained unchanged.	"Id1	78	81	Protein"	"Id2	111	114	Protein"	"Id3	119	122	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Id1"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Id2"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Id3"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The present study also found Id2 and Id3 protein in B cells to be more highly expressed than Id1 in resting B cells.	"Id2	29	32	Protein"	"Id3	37	40	Protein"	"Id1	93	96	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Id2"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Id3"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Id1"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, BMP - 6 did not induce significant changes in the protein expression of Id2 and Id3.	"BMP - 6	9	16	Protein"	"Id2	81	84	Protein"	"Id3	89	92	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Id2"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Id3"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The antiproliferative and death inducing effect of BMP - 6 in B cells with concomitant upregulation of Id1 protein is therefore in line with the view that Id proteins are required for the induction of growth arrest and apoptosis in B - lymphocyte progenitors by TGF - beta [ 40].	"BMP - 6	51	58	Protein"	"Id1	103	106	Protein"	"TGF - beta	262	272	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Id1"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TGF - beta"", ""start_span"": 262, ""end_span"": 272, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Moreover, BMP - 6 has been suggested to play a role in rheumatoid arthritis ( RA) [ 43, 44] and elevated levels of Id1 and Id3 have been found in the synovia of RA - patients [ 45].	"BMP - 6	10	17	Protein"	"Id1	115	118	Protein"	"Id3	123	126	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Id1"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Id3"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These findings are in good agreement with previous findings for other TGF - beta family members, including TGF - beta1 and BMP - 4 [ 50], indicating that cellular context of the BMP target cell might define the various observed effects.	"TGF - beta	70	80	Protein"	"TGF - beta1	107	118	Protein"	"BMP - 4	123	130	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TGF - beta"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TGF - beta1"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""BMP - 4"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Characterisation of BMP - signalling pathways was done by use of anti - phospho - Smad1, - 5, - and 8 polyclonal antibody ( Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA).

Another member of the APOBEC3 family, APOBEC3F ( A3F), appears to have similar activities like A3G ( 26, 27).

Furthermore, A3F proteins were detected in many tissues that express A3G and are able to form heteromultimers with A3G ( 26, 29, 30).

As an internal control, 50 ng ( adherent cells) or 100 ng ( suspension cells) of ph - RG - TK plasmid ( Promega), which constitutively expresses renilla luciferase was cotransfected in every sample and firefly luciferase activities were normalized to renilla luciferase activities.

For stimulation of cells, final concentrations of 20 ng / ml TPA ( Sigma) or 30 ng / ml IFN - alpha or 30 ng / ml IFN - gamma ( Tebu - Bio) were applied approximately 15 h before harvesting for luciferase assay.

To identify the transcriptional start sites ( TSS) of APOBEC3G ( A3G) in A3. 01 T cells, we performed 5 ' - rapid amplification of cDNA ends analysis ( RACE) with A3G - specific primers ( see Figure 1).

Vif induces proteasomal degradation of A3G and additionally inhibits A3G activity by further mechanisms ( 8, 37 - 43).

To investigate whether the overexpression of HIV - 1 proteins also influences A3G promoter activity, we either expressed HIV - 1 Vif or the HIV - 1 Tat protein, the latter has been shown to activate different viral and cellular promoters ( 44, 45).	"A3G	78	81	Protein"	"Vif	129	132	Protein"	"Tat	148	151	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""A3G"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Vif"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Tat"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Similarly, treatment of A3. 01 T cells transfected with the A3G promoter deletion constructs with IFN - alpha or IFN - gamma showed no effect ( Figure 4C).

Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors bind to the GC - box at position - 87 / - 78 of the A3G promoter	"Sp1	0	3	Protein"	"Sp3	8	11	Protein"	"A3G	86	89	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sp1"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Sp3"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""A3G"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Taken together, the EMSA demonstrated that the GC - box located on the A3G core promoter serves as a binding site for Sp1 and Sp3.

To show binding of Sp1 and Sp3 factors also in the context of the endogenous A3G promoter, a chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP) assay was performed.

This demonstrates the binding of Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors to the endogenous A3G promoter.

To confirm the role of Sp1 and Sp3 in regulation of A3G promoter activity, we silenced their translation via RNA interference.

Thus, both Sp1 and Sp3 factors are mediating transcriptional activity of the A3G promoter.

In addition, we observed that the A3G promoter was not inducible by IFN - alpha or IFN - gamma in A3. 01 T cells, whereas in the hepatic cell line HepG2, a moderate induction was measured.

There is evidence that Vif also promotes exclusion of A3G from the virus particles and an influence on the A3G translation process is discussed ( 8, 42, 43).	"Vif	23	26	Protein"	"A3G	54	57	Protein"	"A3G	107	110	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Vif"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""A3G"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""A3G"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In addition, the binding of Sp1 and Sp3 to the endogenous A3G promoter was demonstrated by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay.

We also tested whether overexpression of Sp1 or Sp3 proteins had an influence on A3G promoter activity.

1The protein kinase D ( PKD) serine / threonine kinase family has three members: PKD1, PKD2 and PKD3.

In generating the double knockout cell lines we targeted the PKD1 loci in a PKD3 - / - cell line that expressed a Flag - PKD3 transgene under the control of a doxycycline - inducible promoter.

We initially investigated the regulation of HSP27 phosphorylation in single knockout DT40 B cells lacking either PKD1 or PKD3.

BCR and phorbol ester signals were also able to increase HSP27 phosphorylation in PKD1 or PKD3 single knockout DT40 B cells ( Fig. 1B).

However, BCR - and phorbol ester - induced phosphorylation of HSP27 on S82 was abolished in B cells that lacked both PKD1 and PKD3 ( Fig. 1C).

2A, PKD1 / 3 - / - cells proliferated exponentially and re - expression of Flag - PKD3 in these cells had no impact on the rate of proliferation.

In contrast, BCR and phorbol ester - induced NFkappaB transcriptional activity was abolished in PKCbeta - / - DT40 B cells ( Fig. 4A), although strong activation of PKD kinases ( as assessed by autophosphorylation of PKD1 at S916) was observed in the PKCbeta - / - cells ( Fig. 4B).

We demonstrated that interleukin 4 ( IL - 4) present at the time of T cell priming inhibits FOXP3.

IL - 4 treatment in mice reduces iTreg cell frequency, highlighting that therapeutic approaches that target IL - 4 or GATA3 might provide new preventive strategies facilitating tolerance induction particularly in Th2 - mediated diseases, such as allergy.

Th2 cells are known to produce IL - 4 upon activation, which may interact with TGF - beta signaling and thus prevent FOXP3 induction.	"IL - 4	31	37	Protein"	"TGF - beta	79	89	Protein"	"FOXP3	117	122	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 4"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TGF - beta"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, the neutralization of IL - 4 with a blocking IL - 4 antibody did not rescue FOXP3 expression in the differentiated Th2 cells ( unpublished data).	"IL - 4	31	37	Protein"	"IL - 4	54	60	Protein"	"FOXP3	85	90	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 4"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 4"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Repeated exposure to TGF - beta did not further increase the FOXP3 expression in the iTreg lineage but transiently induced FOXP3 expression in Th1 cells.

We therefore asked whether IL - 4 is able to inhibit TGF - beta induction of FOXP3 during the priming of naive T cells.

IL - 4 efficiently repressed the TGF - beta - mediated induction of FOXP3 expression ( Figure 5A) in a concentration - dependent manner ( Figure 5B).

Of note, GATA3 was also induced in the presence of TGF - beta at high IL - 4 concentration ( Figure 5A and 5B).

Increasing amounts of IL - 4 increase intracellular GATA3, whereas FOXP3 decreased, which is consistent with the mRNA analysis ( Figure 5D).

We used complexes of recombinant mouse IL - 4 ( rmIL - 4) plus anti - IL - 4 monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs), which have been shown to dramatically increase the potency of the cytokine in vivo [ 19].

In these mice, the percentage of CD4 + CD25 + and FOXP3 + T cells dramatically decreased when the antibody - cytokine immune complexes were injected ( Figure S2).

It is known that IL - 4 is a potent growth factor and may therefore favor the proliferation of FOXP3 - cells and thus decrease the relative percentage of FOXP3 + cells.

However, analysis of cell division kinetics by CFSE - labeling demonstrated that IL - 4 did not differentially promote cell growth of FOXP3 + over that of FOXP3 -.

Since FOXP3 is known to act as a repressor of cytokine expression [ 20], we therefore analyzed GATA3 and FOXP3 expression.

After transduction, the cells were activated with soluble anti - CD3 / CD28 in the presence or absence of TGF - beta.

All mice produced similar amounts of TGF - beta; in addition, Smad7 was equally expressed [ 23] in T cells of both mice strains ( Figure 7C), indicating intact TGF - beta signaling.

We transfected human primary CD4 + T cells, in vitro differentiated Th2 cells, and Jurkat cells ( Jurkat cells are known to constitutively express GATA3 [ 25, 26]), and we measured FOXP3 promoter activity.	"CD4	29	32	Protein"	"GATA3	147	152	Protein"	"FOXP3	181	186	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CD4"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GATA3"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 181, ""end_span"": 186, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The promoter was not active in the GATA3 - expressing cell line Jurkat or in the in vitro - differentiated Th2 cells, whereas the construct was active in the CD4 cells, which express a lower amount of GATA3 ( Figure 8A).

To gain insights into the in vivo situation, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP) using an anti - GATA3 antibody and showed that GATA3 binds to the FOXP3 promoter region in Th2 cells, but not in iTreg cells ( Figure 7F).	"GATA3	114	119	Protein"	"GATA3	145	150	Protein"	"FOXP3	164	169	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GATA3"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""GATA3"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 169, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Taken together these data demonstrate that the GATA3 - binding to the FOXP3 promoter is repressing FOXP3 expression.

In accordance with other studies, we found that CD4 + CD25 - cells were able to up - regulate FOXP3 [ 12, 27].

Interestingly, as we and others previously described, FOXP3 - promoting factors, such as dexamethasone [ 39], CTLA - 4 [ 40], and estrogens [ 41], are also known as inhibitors of GATA3 expression [ 42 - 45].

To prove the inhibitory effect of IL - 4 on inducible or natural Treg commitment in vivo, we treated mice with IL - 4 and anti - IL - 4.

In those experiments, the concentrations of IL - 4 used were low, and as we also observed, IL - 4 at low concentration slightly enhanced FOXP3 expression.

In line with the transient overexpression of GATA3 in human T cells, cells of these mice failed to induce FOXP3 expression upon exposure with antigen in the presence of TGF - beta.

Strikingly, the DO11. 10: CD2 - GATA3 mice do have peripheral FOXP3 + cells, which however displayed a 10% - 25% lower frequency compared to wild - type DO11. 10 mice.

GATA - 3 plays a critical role in regulating the expression of the cytokines interleukin ( IL) - 4, IL - 5, and IL - 13 from T helper - 2 ( Th2) cells and therefore is a key mediator of allergic diseases.

In a T lymphocyte cell line ( HuT - 78) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated by anti - CD3 and anti - CD28 in vitro we demonstrated that fluticasone inhibits nuclear translocation of GATA - 3 and expression of Th2 cytokines via a mechanism independent of nuclear factor - kappaB and is due, in part, to competition between GATA - 3 and the ligand - activated glucocorticoid receptor for nuclear transport through the nuclear importer importin - alpha.

The key role of GATA - 3 in allergic airway inflammation has been demonstrated in mice by the reduced release of Th2 cytokines in animals treated with dominant - negative mutants of GATA - 3 and by local application of antisense oligonucleotides to GATA - 3 [ 8], [ 9].

Nuclear localisation and retention of GR is mediated through the nuclear localisation sequences NL1 and NL2 [ 19], by nuclear retention signals [ 20], and by control of nuclear export via a chromosomal region maintenance 1 ( CRM - 1) dependent pathway [ 21].

However, the molecular basis for the inhibition of Th2 cytokines by corticosteroids is not well understood, because the genes encoding IL - 4, IL - 5, and IL - 13 do not have any recognisable GRE sequence [ 29] and are only partly regulated by NF - kappaB in human cells [ 30] - [ 32].

Together, this suggests that ligand - activated GR may compete with phospho - GATA - 3 for importin - alpha and thereby limit GATA - 3 nuclear import.

Nor did addition of FP subsequent to anti - CD3 / CD28 nuclear translocation affect GATA - 3 nuclear residency ( Figure 5C), suggesting that activated GR does not enhance GATA - 3 nuclear export.

Our previous T cell line studies indicated that 10 - 12 M FP suppresses IL - 4 and - 5 gene expression and attenuated the interaction of GATA - 3 with importin - alpha ( see Figures 1D and 2).

Furthermore, we have shown that there is preferential binding of importin - alpha to activated GR over phospho - GATA - 3, so that corticosteroids would preferentially reduce GATA - 3 entry and thus rapidly switch off Th2 gene transcription without any need for any intermediate steps.

We hypothesize that this rapid induction of MKP - 1 can reduce GATA - 3 nuclear import by attenuating p38 MAPK activity and subsequent GATA - 3 phosphorylation, thus preventing nuclear translocation.

To test this hypothesis, RUNX1 and RUNX3 expression was knocked down in human naive CD4 + T cells by transfection of small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs; Fig. 1 B).

On the contrary, FOXP3 mRNA was significantly decreased in RUNX1 - and RUNX3 - deficient T reg cells compared with control cells ( Fig. 1 C).

The effect of RUNX silencing on the expression level of intracellular FOXP3 during naive CD4 + T cell differentiation to iT reg was evaluated by flow cytometry.

Circulating T reg cells expressed significantly higher levels of RUNX3 mRNA compared with CD4 + CD25 - cells.

As expected, IL - 10, TGF - beta, and FOXP3 mRNAs are also expressed in circulating T reg cells ( Fig. 2 A).

Staining of tonsil sections for FOXP3 and RUNX3 demonstrated in vivo coexpression of these two molecules in a subset of T reg cells, whereas there was low RUNX1 expression in all tonsil cells ( Fig. 2 B).

To verify the putative binding sites in the FOXP3 promoter, we transiently transfected HEK293T cells with RUNX1 and RUNX3.

An increase in luciferase activity was observed only when the FOXP3 promoter ( - 511 to + 176) luciferase construct was cotransfected with RUNX1 or RUNX3 expression vectors ( Fig. 4 A).

Luciferase expression was abrogated when the Runx binding sites in the FOXP3 promoter ( - 511 to + 176) luciferase construct were mutated ( Fig. 4 A).

However, mutating the - 53 site in combination with one of the other two sites led to a significant decrease in luciferase activity, with the greatest reduction observed when all three binding sites were mutated ( Fig. 4 B), suggesting that the identified binding sites have redundant functions and RUNX binding to more than one site is necessary for the full activation of the FOXP3 promoter.

Supporting these findings, the overexpression of RUNX1 in human primary CD4 + T cells resulted in significantly elevated levels of FOXP3 protein measured by flow cytometry after 48 h.

This was achieved without any requirement for anti - CD3, anti - CD28 stimulation, or the presence of TGF - beta.

Although there was a trend, the transfection of CD4 + T cells with RUNX3 did not lead to statistically significant increase in FOXP3 ( Fig. S5).

There was no difference in the induction of Foxp3 when endogenous IL - 4 and IFN - gamma were neutralized ( Fig. S6).

These data affirm the significance of RUNX proteins for the in vivo generation of CD4 + Foxp3 + T cells.

After 3 d, Foxp3 + - GFP + cells were sorted by flow cytometry and mixed with CFSE - labeled naive CD45. 1 + CD4 + cells at ratios of 1: 4, 1: 2, and 1: 1.

We isolated human naive CD4 + T cells and transfected them with a combination of RUNX1 and RUNX3 siRNA, or with a scrambled control siRNA.

These results demonstrate the important role of RUNX1 and RUNX3 not only for the induction of FOXP3, but also for the suppressive capacity of iT reg cells both in humans and in mice.

In the suppression experiment with human cells, reduced suppressive activity was caused by reduced FOXP3 expression in T cells by siRNA inhibition of RUNX1 and RUNX3.

This study demonstrates that RUNX transcription factors 1 and 3 play an important role in the generation of FOXP3 + iT reg cells by TGF - beta.

The RUNX protein that actually induces the expression of FOXP3 might therefore be dependent on the availability of the specific RUNX family member at certain stages of T cell development.

TGF - beta can activate RUNX genes at the transcriptional level, and at the posttranscriptional level through activation or stabilization of RUNX proteins ( Jin et al., 2004).

We observed that single siRNA interference of either RUNX1 or RUNX3 alone shows a slight decrease in Foxp3 + T reg cell induction, which could be caused by redundancy of these proteins.

These data in mice confirm the human data that RUNX proteins play an important role for TGF - beta - dependent FOXP3 induction, as well as in the suppressive capacity of iT reg cells.

Cbfb - deficient nT reg cells progressively lose Foxp3 upon division, and there is no evidence of increased death of Cbfb - deficient nT reg cells in that study.

Derepression of Th2 cytokines might also account for some of the observed disease symptoms, as it was shown that T - bet first induces Runx3 in Th1 cells and then partners with Runx3 to direct lineage - specific gene activation.

In addition, inactivation of both Runx1 and Runx3 at the double - positive stages resulted in a severe blockage in the development of CD8 + mature thymocytes.

Specifically, Foxp3 physically interacts with RORgammat, and this interaction inhibits RORgammat function ( Zhou et al., 2008).

Recently, data suggests that Runx1 may also be involved in regulating Il17 transcription, functioning in complex with RORgammat to activate transcription ( Zhang et al., 2008).

Foxp3 protein interacts not only with RUNX proteins but also with several other transcriptional partners, such as NFAT and possibly NF - kappaB; with histone acetyl transferases, such as TIP60; and histone deacetyl transferase ( HDAC) complexes, such as HDAC7 and HDAC9 ( Wu et al., 2006; Sakaguchi et al., 2008).

It was shown that NFAT and Smad3 cooperate to induce Foxp3 expression through its enhancer ( Tone et al., 2008), but no TGF - beta response element was identified in the Foxp3 gene or in the surrounding regions.

Similar to this interaction, NFAT may also cooperate with RUNX1 or RUNX3 to activate Foxp3, but further studies are necessary to elaborate on this concept.

Moreover, the foodborne pathogen Escherichia coli O157: H7 virulence protein NleH1 specifically inhibited RPS3 S209 phosphorylation and blocked RPS3 function, thereby promoting bacterial colonization and diarrhea but decreasing mortality in a gnotobiotic piglet infection model.

However, we recently demonstrated that ribosomal protein S3 ( RPS3) is a key non - Rel subunit of certain native NF - kappaB complexes6.

Additionally, we aimed to define a regulatory role for the C - terminal tail of RPS3 whose function was unknown. Here we show that the Inhibitor of kappaB ( IkappaB) kinase beta ( IKKbeta) phosphorylated RPS3 at serine 209 ( S209).

The activation of the inhibitor of kappaB kinase ( IKK), consisting of a regulatory subunit IKKgamma and two catalytic subunits, IKKalpha and IKKbeta, is critical for the phosphorylation and dispatch of the inhibitory IkappaBs and the liberation of NF - kappaB20 - 22.

Immunoblotting of nuclear fractions confirmed that full expression of IKKbeta, but not IKKalpha, was necessary for activation - induced RPS3 nuclear translocation ( Fig. 2b).

The percentage of cells containing detectable nuclear RPS3 increased 5 - fold in IKKbeta ( SSEE) - expressing cells, but not in IKKbeta ( SSAA) - expressing ones ( Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 2).

Compared with nonspecific siRNA, siRNA targeting of IkappaBalpha completely depleted IkappaBalpha in Jurkat cells ( Fig. 3c, input).

Although originally defined as the kinase that phosphorylates IkappaB19, IKKbeta also phosphorylates unrelated substrates including 14 - 3 - 3beta and Bcl10, which lack the IKK consensus motif ( DpSGYXpS / T) 28.

We discovered that GST - RPS3 could be phosphorylated by IKKbeta, but not IKKalpha, in vitro ( Fig. 4a, compare lanes 4 and 7).

To identify the RPS3 amino acid residue ( s) phosphorylated by IKKbeta, we performed liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry analyses using in vitro phosphorylated RPS3.

To verify biochemically that S209 is an IKKbeta substrate, we performed 32P - labeling in vitro kinase assays with recombinant wild - type or S209A mutant RPS3 proteins.

Indeed, we observed that overexpressing IKKbeta enhanced Flag - RPS3 phosphorylation, but phosphorylation was effectively eliminated by alanine substitution indicating that S209 is the predominant target site for IKKbeta phosphorylation ( Fig. 4d).

IKKbeta overexpression activated NF - kappaB measured by luciferase assays ( Supplementary Fig. 7), and also induced the nuclear translocation of wild - type, but not S209A, RPS3 ( Fig. 5b).

As expected, RPS3 siRNA severely reduced endogenous RPS3 abundance compared to NS siRNA, but did not affect the robust expression of Flag - tagged RPS3 from a transfected construct lacking the 3 ' UTR ( Fig. 5c).

The impaired luciferase signal caused by RPS3 deficiency was completely restored by transfecting wild - type, but not by S209A RPS3 ( Fig. 5d), despite equivalent expression ( Fig. 5c).

Moreover, the failure of S209A RPS3 to restore luciferase activity did not result from defective translation because the transient overexpression of green fluorescent protein ( GFP) was comparable in cells complemented with wild - type or S029A RPS3 ( Supplementary Fig. 8).

While expressing RPS3 S209A had no impact on p65 nuclear translocation, it substantially attenuated p65 recruitment ( Fig. 5e).

Additional experiments revealed that p65 attraction to RPS3 - independent NF - kappaB target gene promoters such as CD25 was increased ( Supplementary Fig. 9), consistent with our previous observations6.

There was no significant Flag - RPS3 or p65 recruitment to ACTB promoter lacking kappaB sites ( Fig. 5e), suggesting the recruitment was kappaB site - specific.

Therefore, RPS3 S209 phosphorylation by IKKbeta is apparently required for RPS3 in directing NF - kappaB to a specific subset of target genes.

The E. coli O157: H7 EDL933 effector protein NleH1 binds to and attenuates RPS3 nuclear translocation, thus impairing RPS3 - dependent NF - kappaB signaling9.	"NleH1	45	50	Protein"	"RPS3	75	79	Protein"	"RPS3	118	122	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NleH1"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RPS3"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RPS3"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Remarkably, NleH1 reduced both TNF - induced, as well as basal RPS3 phosphorylation to roughly 20% of vehicle control ( Fig. 6c).	"NleH1	12	17	Protein"	"TNF	31	34	Protein"	"RPS3	63	67	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NleH1"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TNF"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RPS3"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In contrast, deleting nleH1 had no impact on the expression of RPS3 - independent genes, including CD25 and TNFSF13B ( Supplementary Fig. 12).	"nleH1	22	27	Protein"	"CD25	99	103	Protein"	"TNFSF13B	108	116	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""nleH1"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""CD25"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TNFSF13B"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Together these results demonstrate that NleH1 specifically inhibits the protective immune response by directly blocking RPS3 S209 phosphorylation and thereby impairing critical RPS3 - dependent NF - kappaB target genes.	"NleH1	40	45	Protein"	"RPS3	120	124	Protein"	"RPS3	177	181	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NleH1"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RPS3"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RPS3"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 181, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
While seemingly paradoxical, based on our cell culture data ( Fig. 6d), we hypothesized that NleH1 blocked RPS3 S209 phosphorylation in vivo, thereby preventing RPS3 nuclear translocation in infected piglets.	"NleH1	93	98	Protein"	"RPS3	107	111	Protein"	"RPS3	161	165	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NleH1"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RPS3"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RPS3"", ""start_span"": 161, ""end_span"": 165, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Consistent with in vitro data, piglets infected with wild - type E. coli O157: H7 exhibited diffuse and low intensity phospho - RPS3 staining, whereas in piglets infected with deltanleH1 mutant, phospho - RPS3 expression was florid and intense ( Fig. 6f).	"RPS3	128	132	Protein"	"deltanleH1	176	186	Protein"	"RPS3	205	209	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RPS3"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""deltanleH1"", ""start_span"": 176, ""end_span"": 186, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RPS3"", ""start_span"": 205, ""end_span"": 209, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus NleH1 kinase activity is required to protect RPS3 from IKKbeta - mediated phosphorylation.	"NleH1	5	10	Protein"	"RPS3	50	54	Protein"	"IKKbeta	60	67	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NleH1"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RPS3"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IKKbeta"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, RPS3 phosphorylation was enhanced when cells were infected with a C. rodentium strain lacking NleH ( Fig. 7c, deltanleH).	"RPS3	9	13	Protein"	"NleH	103	107	Protein"	"deltanleH	119	128	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RPS3"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""NleH"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""deltanleH"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We further examined the role of NleH1 kinase activity using the C. rodentium deltanleH strain as a background on which to express either wild - type or K159A E. coli NleH1.	"NleH1	32	37	Protein"	"deltanleH	77	86	Protein"	"NleH1	166	171	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NleH1"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""deltanleH"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""NleH1"", ""start_span"": 166, ""end_span"": 171, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We found that ectopically expressing either wild - type or SSEE IKKbeta proteins, triggered more RPS3 nuclear translocation than the kinase - dead IKKbeta ( SSAA) protein ( Fig. 7d).	"SSEE IKKbeta	59	71	Protein"	"RPS3	97	101	Protein"	"IKKbeta	147	154	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SSEE IKKbeta"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""RPS3"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IKKbeta"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, during infection NleH1 is sufficiently potent to inhibit RPS3 nuclear translocation even in cells expressing constitutively - activated IKKbeta.

We performed in vitro kinase assays using immunoprecipitated Flag - IKKbeta ( K44A) as substrate and recombinant His - NleH1 as kinase, so that IKKbeta autophosphorylation would not obscure NleH1 - induced phosphorylation.

As expected, IKKbeta phosphorylated RPS3 ( Fig. 7e, lane 7) and GST - IkappaBalpha ( 1 - 54) protein ( Fig. 7e, lane 9), demonstrating it harbors either CK2 or IKK substrate specificity.

NleH1 attenuates the transcription of RPS3 - dependent, but not all, NF - kappaB target genes, in particular those genes associated with acute proinflammatory responses, including IL8 and TNF.

Moreover, Tat associated with the p65 subunit of NF - kappaB and increased the p65 DNA - binding affinity and transcriptional activity.

The arginine - and cysteine - rich domains of Tat were required for IkappaB - alpha and p65 association, respectively, and for sustaining the NF - kappaB activity.

Our results support a novel mechanism of NF - kappaB activation via physical interaction of Tat with IkappaB - alpha and p65, and may contribute to further insights into the deregulation of the inflammatory response by HIV - 1.

The transcriptional activity of the NF - kappaB complex depends on dimer composition since C - terminal unrelated transcriptional activation domains are present exclusively in p65, RelB and c - Rel ( 2).

Acetylation of p65 at Lys218 and Lys221 increases the DNA binding and impairs the association with IkappaB - alpha, and acetylation at Lys310 enhances the p65 transcriptional activity ( 12, 13).

In HIV - 1 entry, the binding of the gp120 viral envelope to CD4 induces the NF - kappaB activity by activation of IKK ( 30) and procaspase 8 ( 31).

These findings suggested that Tat modulates crucial enzymes involved in NF - kappaB signaling; however, it was unclear how Tat could subvert the negative feedback of NF - kappaB, which is mainly dependent on de novo synthesis of IkappaB - alpha ( 15, 17).

In this study, we report that Tat counteracts the post - activation turn off of NF - kappaB through direct interaction with IkappaB - alpha and p65, which enhances the DNA binding and transcriptional activity of the NF - kappaB complex.

Consistently, GST - pull down of in vitro translated proteins showed the direct binding of p65 to wild - type Tat, or the mutants Tat T, N ( 23, 24) A, Tat K ( 50, 51) A and Tat R ( 49 - 57) A, and lack of binding to Tat C ( 22, 25, 27) A ( Figure 4B).

Tat coimmunoprecipitated with p65deltaC ( 1 - 318), and not with p65deltaN ( 122 - 551) ( Figure 4D), indicating that the RHD of p65 was involved in the physical interaction with Tat.	"Tat	0	3	Protein"	"p65	30	33	Protein"	"Tat	179	182	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Tat"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Tat"", ""start_span"": 179, ""end_span"": 182, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Whereas wild - type Tat significantly increased the binding of p65 to DNA, the mutant Tat C ( 22, 25, 27) A, lacking the binding site for p65, was ineffective ( Figure 4E).	"Tat	20	23	Protein"	"p65	63	66	Protein"	"p65	138	141	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Tat"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The p65 binding to DNA was evaluated by competition with increasing amounts of cold competitor NF - kappaB oligonucleotide, which showed that Tat significantly enhanced the p65 affinity binding to DNA ( Figure 4E and F).	"p65	4	7	Protein"	"Tat	142	145	Protein"	"p65	173	176	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Tat"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 173, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Differently, the expression of the NF - kappaB - independent genes GAPDH and ACTB was unaffected by wild - type and Tat mutants ( Figure 5F and G).	"GAPDH	67	72	Protein"	"ACTB	77	81	Protein"	"Tat	116	119	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GAPDH"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""ACTB"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Tat"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Consistently with our findings, MIP - 1alpha expression was increased in glial cells and lymph nodes of AIDS patients ( 57, 58); moreover, MIP - 1alpha production was induced by HIV - 1 infection ( 59, 60) and Tat protein ( 57, 61, 62).	"MIP - 1alpha	32	44	Protein"	"MIP - 1alpha	139	151	Protein"	"Tat	210	213	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MIP - 1alpha"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""MIP - 1alpha"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Tat"", ""start_span"": 210, ""end_span"": 213, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Tat also promoted the recruitment of p65 to the NF - kappaB1 site of MIP - 1alpha, while it did not affect the putative NF - kappaB2 and NF - kappaB3 sites ( Supplementary Figure S3D).	"Tat	0	3	Protein"	"p65	37	40	Protein"	"MIP - 1alpha	69	81	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Tat"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""MIP - 1alpha"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Altogether these results indicated that the NF - kappaB1 site was the only effective NF - kappaB enhancer of the MIP - 1alpha promoter in response to TNF - alpha and Tat.	"MIP - 1alpha	113	125	Protein"	"TNF - alpha	150	161	Protein"	"Tat	166	169	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MIP - 1alpha"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TNF - alpha"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Tat"", ""start_span"": 166, ""end_span"": 169, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To detect the Tat protein, we produced HXB2 Env - pseudotyped NL4 - 3. FLAG - Tat. R - E - virions, which were used in single - round infection of U937, a human monocytic cell line.	"Tat	14	17	Protein"	"Env	44	47	Protein"	"FLAG - Tat	71	81	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Tat"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Env"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""FLAG - Tat"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The expression of Tat and p24 was detected at 3 - to 12 - h post - infection, while it was barely detected in siRNA Tat - transfected cells ( Figure 6A).	"Tat	18	21	Protein"	"p24	26	29	Protein"	"siRNA Tat	110	119	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Tat"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p24"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""siRNA Tat"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Degradation of IkappaB - alpha was observed at 3 - h post - infection, and was followed by de novo synthesis of IkappaB - alpha at 12 h independently of the Tat presence ( Figure 6C).	"IkappaB - alpha	15	30	Protein"	"IkappaB - alpha	112	127	Protein"	"Tat	157	160	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IkappaB - alpha"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IkappaB - alpha"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Tat"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 160, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Soon after the shut off of IKK activity and new synthesis of IkappaB - alpha, the NF - kappaB activity was kept elevated in the presence of Tat, while it was down regulated upon silencing of the Tat gene.	"IkappaB - alpha	61	76	Protein"	"Tat	140	143	Protein"	"Tat	195	198	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IkappaB - alpha"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Tat"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Tat"", ""start_span"": 195, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Similar kinetic of NF - kappaB activation occurred upon short - pulse of PMA in Tat - transfected HeLa cells, where Tat inhibited the post - activation turn off of NF - kappaB in presence of newly synthesized IkappaB - alpha.	"Tat	80	83	Protein"	"Tat	116	119	Protein"	"IkappaB - alpha	209	224	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Tat"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Tat"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IkappaB - alpha"", ""start_span"": 209, ""end_span"": 224, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Of interest, IkappaB - alpha was found associated to the NF - kappaB enhancers in absence of Tat, where it was displaced in presence of Tat.	"IkappaB - alpha	13	28	Protein"	"Tat	93	96	Protein"	"Tat	136	139	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IkappaB - alpha"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Tat"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Tat"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
A similar mechanism of gene regulation could apply to the NF - kappaB - dependent genes analysed in this study, where Tat could activate the gene expression by removing IkappaB - alpha and promoting the p65 loading ( Figure 7).	"Tat	118	121	Protein"	"IkappaB - alpha	169	184	Protein"	"p65	203	206	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Tat"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IkappaB - alpha"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 184, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 203, ""end_span"": 206, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This study supports the pro - inflammatory action of Tat through physical interaction with p65 and IkappaB - alpha.	"Tat	53	56	Protein"	"p65	91	94	Protein"	"IkappaB - alpha	99	114	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Tat"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IkappaB - alpha"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Several inflammatory cytokines under the transcriptional control of NF - kappaB are hyper - expressed in HIV - 1 infected individuals, including IL - 6 ( 66, 67), TNF - alpha ( 68), and MIP - 1alpha ( 57 - 62, 69 - 71).	"IL - 6	145	151	Protein"	"TNF - alpha	163	174	Protein"	"MIP - 1alpha	186	198	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 6"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""TNF - alpha"", ""start_span"": 163, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""MIP - 1alpha"", ""start_span"": 186, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In the case of TNF - alpha and IL - 6, Tat activated the cytokine expression by binding to the TAR - like stem loop of the 5 ' transcript, thus likely promoting the transcriptional elongation ( 33, 37, 47).	"TNF - alpha	15	26	Protein"	"IL - 6	31	37	Protein"	"Tat	39	42	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNF - alpha"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IL - 6"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""Tat"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
( A) Nuclear extracts were analysed for the p65, p50 and FLAG - Tat binding to the NF - kappaB double - stranded oligonucleotide using the NF - kappaB Transcription Factor ELISA assay kit ( Cayman).

Tat relieves p65 from the IkappaB - alpha inhibition.

( C) 35S - methionine - labeled p65 ( 5 microl) was incubated with in vitro translated HA - IkappaB - alpha ( 5 microl) in presence or absence of FLAG - Tat or FLAG - Tat R ( 49 - 57) A ( 5, 10 or 20 microl).

32P - labeled - NF - kappaB double - stranded oligonucleotide was incubated with p65 ( 0. 5 microl) in presence or absence of HA - IkappaB - alpha ( 1 microl), FLAG - Tat or FLAG - Tat R ( 49 - 57) A ( 5 and 10 microl); competition of DNA binding was performed with 10 - up to 100 - fold molar excess of unlabeled NF - kappaB double - stranded oligonucleotide.

U937 cells ( 5 x 107) were transfected with siRNA Tat, siRNA control ( 2 nmol), or left untransfected; 24 h later cells were infected with HXB2 - pseudotyped NL4 - 3. FLAG - Tat.

( A) In absence of Tat, IkappaB - alpha occupies the NF - kappaB enhancer of the MIP - 1alpha promoter and likely interacts with transcriptional repressors, such as HDACs ( 65), to inhibit gene transcription.

( B) Tat activates the MIP - 1alpha expression by removing the IkappaB - alpha repressor from the NF - kappaB enhancer, and by increasing the binding of p65 NF - kappaB complex to the NF - kappaB enhancer.

By employing a deletion mutant in exsA, the key regulator in T3SS transcription, we confirmed that the T3SS is important for IL - 1beta secretion ( Fig. 5a - b), and that depending on the adaptation in type III secretion, the host IL - 1beta response may be up or downregulated [ 19], [ 60], [ 61].
