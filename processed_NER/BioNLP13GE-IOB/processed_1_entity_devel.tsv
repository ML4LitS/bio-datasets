A potential role of BMP - 6 in the immune system has been implied by various studies of malignant and rheumatoid diseases.	"BMP - 6	20	27	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In the present study, we explored the role of BMP - 6 in normal human peripheral blood B cells.	"BMP - 6	46	53	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Additionally, BMP - 6 induced cell death in activated memory B cells.	"BMP - 6	14	21	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore, B cells were demonstrated to upregulate BMP - 6 mRNA upon stimulation with anti - IgM.	"BMP - 6	53	60	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

BMP - 6 has been reported to reduce the number of cobblestone - area - forming cells of normal human haematopoietic cells [ 8].	"BMP - 6	0	7	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In addition, by gene expression profiling, BMP - 6 significantly increased the predictive value for a multi - gene signature test and was associated with a poor outcome in diffuse large B cell lymphomas ( DLBCL) [ 12].	"BMP - 6	43	50	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
BMP - 6, like the other BMP members, signals through ligation and heterodimerzation of BMP type I [ activin - like - kinase ( ALK)] and type II serine - threonine kinase receptors, which subsequently propagates the signal downstream by phosphorylating Smad proteins.	"BMP - 6	0	7	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The R - Smads then form complexes with the co - Smad ( Smad4) and are translocated into the nucleus where they exert gene regulation [ 1, 13].	"Smad4	55	60	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Smad4"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Given the reported role of BMP - 6 in B - cell malignancies and haematopoietic progenitor cells, we wanted to explore its potential role in normal human B cells.	"BMP - 6	27	34	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We studied the effects of BMP - 6 on proliferation and apoptosis on resting and stimulated B cells.	"BMP - 6	26	33	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Finally, we investigated whether B cells also were capable of producing BMP - 6.	"BMP - 6	72	79	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
BMP - 6 inhibits anti - IgM induced proliferation of human B cells	"BMP - 6	0	7	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We found that BMP - 6 led to a 35% mean reduction of anti - IgM - induced DNA synthesis ( n = 8; p < = 0. 0002, Figure 1A).	"BMP - 6	14	21	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Similar results were obtained for B cells treated with anti - IgM and CD40L ( 26% mean reduction, n = 6; p < = 0. 023).	"CD40L	70	75	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CD40L"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The BMP - 6 - induced inhibition of proliferation was dose - dependent in both peripheral B cells ( Figure 1B) and the Burkitt lymphoma cell line Ramos ( 40% reduction of DNA synthesis, Figure 1C).	"BMP - 6	4	11	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Next, we wanted to test whether BMP - 6 had different effect on naive and memory B cells.	"BMP - 6	32	39	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, BMP - 6 inhibited anti - IgM induced DNA synthesis in the two subpopulations to a similar extent, with a mean reduction of DNA - synthesis of 45% ( n = 5; p < = 0, 004) for naive B cells and 48% ( n = 5; p < = 0, 001) for memory B cells ( Figure 1E).

Cell viability was determined by propidium iodide ( PI) staining after culture with or without BMP - 6 for 48 hours.	"BMP - 6	95	102	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore, Ramos cells showed a mean increase in cell death from 20 to 50% ( n = 3, p < 0, 001, figure 3) after BMP - 6 treatment.	"BMP - 6	114	121	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Taken together, these data show that normal human B cells and Ramos cells express a set of BMP receptors, previously shown to bind BMP - 6 [ 16].	"BMP - 6	131	138	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We examined the effect of BMP - 6 on Smad phosphorylation, as the activation of Smad is considered to be a major signalling pathway for BMPs [ 17].	"BMP - 6	26	33	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
B cells were cultured in serum - free media over night and then treated with BMP - 6 for various time points.	"BMP - 6	77	84	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Interestingly, treatment with 500 ng / ml BMP - 6 induced phosphorylation of Smad.	"BMP - 6	42	49	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The BMP - 6 induced phosphorylation was high at the earliest time point tested ( 15 minutes), and remained high for at least 48 hours ( Figure 5).	"BMP - 6	4	11	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, B cells were pre - incubated over night in X - VIVO 15, and then cultured in medium alone or in the presence of BMP - 6 for various time points before preparation of total RNA.

Ramos cells, which have been described to express BMP - 6 mRNA endogenously [ 20], and the T cell line Jurkat, served as positive and negative controls, respectively.	"BMP - 6	50	57	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Endogenous BMP - 6 mRNA levels in normal B cells were quantified by real - time RT - PCR after stimulation with anti - IgM for different time points.	"BMP - 6	11	18	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Interestingly, the up - regulation of BMP - 6 mRNA was characteristic of an early - to intermediate inducible gene with maximal upregulation four hours after the addition of anti - IgM.	"BMP - 6	38	45	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The level of BMP - 6 mRNA was back to baseline after 24 hours upon stimulation ( Figure 10).	"BMP - 6	13	20	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore, both FCS and human AB - serum induced significant upregulation of BMP - 6 mRNA ( Figure 11).	"BMP - 6	79	86	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Interestingly, in a separate study we have found that normal human T cells do not express BMP - 6 mRNA after activation ( Sivertsen et al, manuscript in preparation).	"BMP - 6	90	97	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Next, we wanted to detect BMP - 6 protein in normal B - cells and tested various commercially available antibodies.	"BMP - 6	26	33	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In the present study, the demonstrated antiproliferative effect of BMP - 6 in anti - IgM treated B cells was significant and dose - dependent.	"BMP - 6	67	74	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

To examine how BMP - 6 exerts its functional effects in B cells, we analysed BMP receptor expression by western blot analysis.	"BMP - 6	15	22	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To further explore BMP - 6 induced signalling, activation of several pathways is possible.	"BMP - 6	19	26	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Previously, Id1 has been considered not to be expressed in later developmental stages than pro - B cells [ 33, 34], and its constitutive expression has been reported to impair mouse B cell development [ 35].	"Id1	12	15	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Id1"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, our demonstration of the time - dependent upregulation of Id1 mRNA and protein in mature normal human B cells is of particular interest.	"Id1	69	72	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Id1"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Interestingly, these results show that various members of the TGF - beta family regulate Id proteins differently.	"TGF - beta	62	72	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TGF - beta"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Id proteins act as dominant - negative inhibitors of E - proteins and Pax5 function by forming dimers with these proteins, making them unable to bind DNA.	"Pax5	70	74	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Pax5"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It has been proposed that the balance among E - proteins, Pax5 and Id proteins might have an important role in activated B cells [ 38].	"Pax5	58	62	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Pax5"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It is well established that various members of the Id family are overexpressed in a range of human tumours and generally, Id1 appears to be the family member most widely overexpressed in a variety of human malignancies [ 41], including multiple myeloma [ 42, 32].

Additionally, our findings that BMP - 6 activates intracellular signalling pathways in human B cells might be of potential pathophysiological significance in lymphoma and inflammation.	"BMP - 6	32	39	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
High BMP - 6 mRNA expression in DLBCL has been shown to correlate to unfavourable outcome [ 12].	"BMP - 6	5	12	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In this respect, it is of interest that targeted expression of Id1 to B - lymphocytes resulted in aberrant B cell development, massive apoptosis, and subsequent development of B cell lymphomas [ 35].

Furthermore, production of BMP - 6 transcripts in normal activated B cells was detected in the same study.	"BMP - 6	27	34	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Of note, an autocrine BMP - 6 loop has been reported by others in chondrocytes and in the ovarium [ 46, 19, 18].	"BMP - 6	22	29	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, we wanted to explore the possibility for an autocrine BMP - 6 loop in human B cells.	"BMP - 6	65	72	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In that respect, few investigators have detected BMP - 6 protein in humans, especially in non - pathogenic tissue.	"BMP - 6	49	56	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

A loss of TGF - beta - responsiveness has been suggested to be a critical contribution to malignant transformation [ 47, 48] and similar oncogenic mechanisms have been postulated for BMPs.

Lines of evidence suggest [ 49] that at early stages of carcinogenesis, BMP - 6 is not a tumour promoter, but suppresses benign and malignant tumour outgrowth.	"BMP - 6	72	79	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Other potential BMP - 6 sources for mature B cells in vivo might be other cells of the immune system or tissue with contact to the hematopoietic system.	"BMP - 6	16	23	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
One well recognized source for BMP - 6 production is the human bone and bone marrow stroma [ 51, 8].	"BMP - 6	31	38	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These studies might imply a role for BMP - 6 in transendothelial migration of B cells.	"BMP - 6	37	44	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""BMP - 6"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Taken together, these results provide a rationale to further examine the role of BMP - 6 signalling in normal B cell biology as well as in pathologic conditions like B cell malignancies and autoimmune disorders.

To gain new insights into the transcriptional regulation of this restriction factor, we cloned and characterized the promoter region of A3G.	"A3G	136	139	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""A3G"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that a 1025 bp A3G promoter sequence ( from - 959 to + 66 relative to the major transcriptional start site) displayed constitutive promoter activity.

This result is perhaps not surprising as LxRxxS / T motifs also act as good substrates for other serine / threonine kinases such as MAPKAPK2.	"MAPKAPK2	132	140	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MAPKAPK2"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, PKD - mediated activation of NFkappaB occurs downstream of a variety of different signals, including mROS / oxidative stress, lysophosphatidic acid and the Bcr - Abl oncogene [ 17, 21, 23, 30, 37].

FOXP3 is an essential transcription factor for natural, thymus - derived ( nTreg) and inducible Treg ( iTreg) commitment; however, the mechanisms regulating its expression are as yet unknown.	"FOXP3	0	5	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These induced Treg ( iTreg) cells were reported to express FOXP3 [ 10].	"FOXP3	59	64	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The exact mechanisms of iTreg generation are unclear, but T cell receptor ( TCR) triggering has been shown to induce FOXP3 expression and suppressive cells in human [ 11, 12], however the phenotype appears to be of transient nature [ 13, 14].

It is assumed that FOXP3 expression can be induced in nonregulatory T cells, which is an important step in iTreg cell differentiation.	"FOXP3	19	24	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In contrast, Th2 cells stimulated under the same conditions did not increase FOXP3 expression.	"FOXP3	77	82	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The in vitro generated iTreg cells were unable to further up - regulate FOXP3, which was already at high levels under the resting conditions ( Figure 1B, right panel).	"FOXP3	72	77	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These data demonstrated that Th2 cells have a limited capacity to express FOXP3 ( Figure 1B).	"FOXP3	74	79	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Taken together, these data indicate that FOXP3 was not expressed by Th2 cells and was not inducible in those cells.	"FOXP3	41	46	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The limited capacity of differentiated effector cells to induce FOXP3 expression suggests that iTreg induction has to occur before effector T cell differentiation occurs.	"FOXP3	64	69	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Under Th2 differentiation conditions, FOXP3 mRNA expression increased only marginally ( Figure 4A, left panel).	"FOXP3	38	43	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Taken together, these data demonstrated that Th2 cells have lost their capacity to express FOXP3 and showed that Th2 and iTreg cells arise from two different differentiation pathways.	"FOXP3	91	96	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

This site is highly conserved between humans, mice, and rats ( Figure S4) and may therefore play an important role in FOXP3 regulation.	"FOXP3	118	123	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The functional relevance of this site was studied using a FOXP3 - promoter construct [ 24].	"FOXP3	58	63	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Similarly, GATA3 - expressing Th2 cells and iTreg cells were subjected to this approach.	"GATA3	11	16	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GATA3"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
After differentiation, the effector Th2 cells become refractory to conversion into a FOXP3 + phenotype.	"FOXP3	85	90	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Already - committed cells such as memory T cells and Th1 cells showed only moderate and transient FOXP3 induction, which is not sufficient to change the phenotype toward a regulatory T cell profile.	"FOXP3	98	103	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This commitment is characterized by competitive expression of these factors [ 35, 36], which we also observed in differentiating FOXP3 + iTreg cells including a phase of co - expression, which turns into nonoverlapping expression upon completed differentiation.	"FOXP3	129	134	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""FOXP3"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Our results suggest that IL - 4 is only interfering with the differentiation of naive T cells into iTreg cells.	"IL - 4	25	31	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 4"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Importantly, these concentrations were not sufficient to induce GATA3 expression.	"GATA3	64	69	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GATA3"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus GATA3 restrains the development of certain Treg subsets, presumably the inducible, peripheral population and not those of thymic origin.	"GATA3	5	10	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GATA3"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thymic T cells undergo a different maturation process, which may explain the insensitivity of nTreg to GATA3 overexpression [ 52].	"GATA3	103	108	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GATA3"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

The increase in ICAM - 1 expression was higher on THP - 1 cells treated with 40 kDa dCGN ( Fig. 4B).	"ICAM - 1	16	24	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ICAM - 1"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
ICAM - 1 has been proposed to be the main adhesion molecule responsible for monocyte aggregation.	"ICAM - 1	0	8	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ICAM - 1"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The anti - ICAM - 1 antibody effectively blocked the cell aggregates induced by dCGN ( Fig. 5D, 5E), strongly suggesting that indeed ICAM - 1 is responsible for monocyte aggregation.	"ICAM - 1	11	19	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ICAM - 1"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Using a reporter plasmid for NF - kappaB activation, it was confirmed that dCGN induced a strong activation of NF - kappaB, as reflected by an increase in luciferase activity ( Fig. 7A).	"luciferase	155	165	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""luciferase"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 165, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These assays also allowed us to determine what NF - kappaB subunits were activated by dCGN.	"NF - kappaB subunits	47	67	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NF - kappaB subunits"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, we analyzed the production of TNF by both PBM and THP - 1 cells in response to dCGN.	"TNF	36	39	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNF"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Degraded CGN induced a robust production of TNF by monocytes.	"TNF	44	47	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNF"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Surprisingly, monocyte activation by dCGN to produce TNF was much stronger than the activation induced by LPS, an inflammatory factor considered to be among the most potent stimuli for leukocyte activation.	"TNF	53	56	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNF"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The amount of TNF secreted by PBM induced with LPS was much larger than the one secreted by THP - 1 monocytes.	"TNF	14	17	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNF"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
CD14 is not expressed by THP - 1 monocytes, but it is expressed by PBM.	"CD14	0	4	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CD14"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This fact could explain why THP - 1 cells produced a much smaller response to LPS than PBM and also the difference of kinetics in the LPS induced TNF secretion.	"TNF	146	149	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNF"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The peak of TNF response was observed after 8 h stimulation followed by a rapid decrease to baseline at 10 h, whereas on THP - 1 cells the peak was not reached until after 56 h.	"TNF	12	15	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNF"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Moreover, the amount of TNF secreted by monocytes induced with dCGN was much larger than the one induced by LPS.	"TNF	24	27	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNF"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
On the other hand, LPS and dCGN displayed a very different TNF secretion curve in THP - 1 cells.	"TNF	59	62	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNF"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It is noteworthy that neutralizing antibody to CD14 only partially ( < 40%) inhibited dCGN - induced TNF secretion ( not shown).	"TNF	101	104	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNF"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, it is possible that TLR4 is activated by dCGN to induce cytokine secretion by monocytes.	"TLR4	26	30	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TLR4"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We can only speculate that TLR4 may have a higher affinity - binding site for dCGN than for LPS, however, this hypothesis remains to be tested.	"TLR4	27	31	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TLR4"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

This correlates with the higher expression of ICAM - 1 induced by the 40 kDa dCGN, suggesting that the partially degraded CGN is more biologically active.	"ICAM - 1	46	54	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""ICAM - 1"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Consistent with this notion, RPS3 association with importin - alpha, but not importin - beta, was enhanced in TNF - stimulated cells ( Fig. 3a).	"RPS3	29	33	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RPS3"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Its physiological effects are diverse and potentially important to the pathogenesis of lung exacerbations in CF, including the generation of fever, the recruitment of inflammatory effector cells, the induction of other pro - inflammatory cytokines such as IL - 6 and IL - 8, and the shaping of T cell responses [ 9], [ 10].

Inflammasome responses depend on NF - kappaB signaling, where NF - kappaB is important in both the upregulation of specific inflammasome components [ 22], [ 23], as well as IL - 1beta expression [ 24], [ 25].

Levels of IL - 1beta are increased in BALF from CF patients with infection [ 21], [ 26], [ 27], [ 28] and this increase has been temporally associated with a clinical response to treatment [ 21].

Murine models of CFTR dysfunction have exhibited significant increases in IL - 1beta expression or secretion in macrophages [ 30], [ 31], and support the hypothesis that the loss of CFTR increases NF - kappaB activation under basal and stimulatory conditions [ 4], [ 5], [ 32], [ 33].

Finally, replacement of chloride ions with glutamate or gluconate in cell culture media increases secretion of IL - 1beta in response to NLRP3 stimulation by adenosine triphosphate ( ATP) [ 34], implying an inhibitory role for extracellular chloride in NLRP3 activation.

To determine if airway epithelial cells contribute to the increased IL - 1beta production in patients with CF, CF and control bronchial epithelial cell lines were stimulated with the inflammasome inducers P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 ( PAO1) and LPS followed by ATP.	"IL - 1beta	68	78	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 1beta"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In contrast, these airway cells were highly responsive to other inflammatory stimuli, such as recombinant IL - 1beta, producing large quantities of IL - 8 ( Fig. 2a - d inserts).

Because previous studies have indicated a role for caspase - 1 in the activation of NF - kappaB through Toll - like receptor ( TLR) signaling [ 35], we examined whether chemical inhibition of caspase - 1 altered NF - kappaB - dependent IL - 6 production in response to P. aeruginosa.

By 24 hours of stimulation, CF PBMCs did not produce increased amounts of IL - 1beta ( Fig. 5a) or IL - 8 ( Fig. 5b) when compared to healthy controls.	"IL - 1beta	74	84	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 1beta"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, we did notice a transient decrease ( P < 0. 001) in the amount of IL - 1beta produced by CF cells in response to LPS + ATP at 6 hours ( data not shown).	"IL - 1beta	75	85	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 1beta"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

We confirmed the dependence of PAO1 - induced IL - 1beta and IL - 8 production on NF - kappaB activation using THP - 1 cells expressing a reporter driven by NF - kappaB and AP - 1 response elements.	"IL - 1beta	46	56	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 1beta"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We found that stimulation of primed THP - 1 reporter cells with heat - killed PAO1 produced the highest levels of NF - kappaB / AP - 1 activation ( Fig. 6a) and this correlated with IL - 8 secretion ( Fig. 6b) but negligible amounts of IL - 1beta were secreted ( Fig. 6c).

This was further corroborated by the ability Bay11 - 7082 to inhibit IkappaBalpha degradation at 0. 5, 1, and 1. 5 hours post PAO1 stimulation ( Fig. 7b).	"IkappaBalpha	69	81	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IkappaBalpha"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

To determine whether CFTR dysfunction alters IL - 1beta production, THP - 1 cells and PBMCs from CF patients and healthy controls were treated with the CFTR inhibitor, CFTRinh172, prior to simulation with live P. aeruginosa.	"IL - 1beta	45	55	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 1beta"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Treatment with CFTRinh172 did not alter IL - 1beta or IL - 8 production in control subjects or CF patients ( Fig. 8a - b).	"IL - 1beta	40	50	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 1beta"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Similarly, IL - 1beta production was not different in monocyte - derived macrophages or THP - 1 reporter cells treated with CFTRinh172 ( Fig. 8c - d).	"IL - 1beta	11	21	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 1beta"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Levels of IL - 1beta are increased in the BALF of CF patients but the cellular source of this cytokine and its production in the context of targeted inflammasome activation are still unclear.	"IL - 1beta	10	20	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 1beta"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, we found that bronchial epithelial cells do not produce significant amounts of IL - 1beta and do not show a significant increase in caspase - 1 activation in response to PAO1 and LPS + ATP, in comparison to hematopoeitic mononuclear cells.	"IL - 1beta	88	98	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 1beta"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Hematopoeitically - derived cells, such as monocytes and macrophages, appear to be a principal source of IL - 1beta.	"IL - 1beta	105	115	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 1beta"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This interaction may constitute a critical component to effective host defense and diminishing the capacity of host cells to respond to IL - 1beta may leave the host susceptible to infections by pathogens such as P. aeruginosa [ 43].

Conversely, overproduction of IL - 1beta can also play a key role in chronic inflammatory responses and cause damage to the lung parenchyma [ 44], [ 45].	"IL - 1beta	30	40	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 1beta"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This was in contrast to a previous study from our group, which showed increased IL - 1beta production by CF PBMCs in response to LPS [ 46], although this difference may be accounted for by technical issues in stimulation time and dose.	"IL - 1beta	80	90	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 1beta"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Moreover, IL - 1beta production was not increased in CF PBMCs with inflammasome stimulation alone as would be anticipated if there were basal levels of NF - kappaB activation.	"IL - 1beta	10	20	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 1beta"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This amplification of IL - 1beta secretion was shown by priming THP - 1 monocytes and PBMCs with heat - killed P. aeruginosa or LPS prior to stimulation with live P. aeruginosa.	"IL - 1beta	22	32	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 1beta"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This dramatically increased IL - 1beta secretion over stimulation with live P. aeruginosa without priming ( Fig. 6c).	"IL - 1beta	28	38	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 1beta"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Similarly, if CF PBMCs expressed increased basal NF - kappaB activity, there would be an increase in IL - 1beta secretion in the absence of LPS priming.	"IL - 1beta	101	111	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 1beta"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, no increase in IL - 1beta was observed under basal or primed conditions.	"IL - 1beta	24	34	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 1beta"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Studies investigating the production of IL - 1beta have been somewhat inconsistent.	"IL - 1beta	40	50	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 1beta"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
[ 43] provided evidence that human bronchial epithelial cells possessing the deltaF508 CFTR mutation had a slightly reduced capacity to produce IL - 1beta and lacked the ability to induce an early NF - kappaB activation in response to P. aeruginosa.	"IL - 1beta	144	154	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 1beta"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Inflammasome - mediated IL - 1beta production by monocytes and PBMCs does differ from macrophages [ 47], [ 48], [ 49] and macrophages are found to have higher expression of CFTR over monocytes [ 50].	"IL - 1beta	24	34	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 1beta"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Other hematopoeitic cells may also contribute to IL - 1beta production.	"IL - 1beta	49	59	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 1beta"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
For example, neutrophil counts can be significantly increased in the lungs of CF patients [ 52], [ 53], [ 54] and may produce mature IL - 1beta through caspase - 1 independent mechanisms [ 55].

The role of NF - kappaB activation in inflammasome activation and IL - 1beta secretion is not straightforward.	"IL - 1beta	66	76	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 1beta"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Subsequent treatment of THP - 1 cells and PBMCs with the NF - kappaB inhibitor Bay11 - 7082 significantly inhibited both IL - 1beta and IL - 8 secretion ( Fig. 6d - h).	"IL - 1beta	121	131	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 1beta"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, the IL - 1beta and IL - 8 responses observed were both dependent upon NF - kappaB activation.	"IL - 1beta	15	25	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 1beta"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Priming with heat - killed P. aeruginosa, like LPS, is unable to induce a strong IL - 1beta response as compared to live P. aeruginosa ( Fig. 6c), but generated greater NF - kappaB / AP - 1 activation ( Fig. 6a) and IL - 8 secretion ( Fig. 6b) than live bacteria despite stimulation at equivalent MOIs.	"IL - 1beta	81	91	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 1beta"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In conclusion, our data are consistent with a role for hematopoietic cells, not airway epithelial cells, as the major source of inflammasome - mediated IL - 1beta production in the lungs in response to ATP and P. aeruginosa.
