In mature human B cells, BMP - 6 inhibited cell growth, and rapidly induced phosphorylation of Smad1 / 5 / 8 followed by an upregulation of Id1.

Upregulation of Id1 via Smad1 / 5 / 8 phosphorylation is a known mechanism for BMP - 6 signalling in other cell systems [ 31, 32] and regulation of Id - proteins is thought to be an important mechanism for Smad - signalling [ 17].

Luciferase assays showed that the transcriptional activity of the A3G promoter was not significantly altered in the presence of Vif, Tat or HIV - 1NL4 - 3 ( Figure 4A), suggesting that HIV - 1 is not modulating A3G expression on the transcriptional level.

To investigate the effect that loss of PKD kinases had on B cell survival and / or proliferation we cultured wild - type and PKD - null cells in the presence ( PKD1 / 3 - / -: Flag - PKD3 + ve) or absence ( PKD1 / 3 - / -) of doxycycline and monitored exponential growth.

It was noted that the population doubling time of PKD1 / 3 - / - cells was slightly slower than that of wild type DT40 cells ( 12. 7 + / - 2. 8 h versus 10. 2 + / - 0. 4 h) but the failure of PKD3 re - expression to modify the proliferation rate of PKD1 / 3 - / - cells suggests that these small differences were most likely the result of clonal variation and were not caused specifically by loss of PKD enzymes.

Hence, BCR - induced activation of the Akt, mTOR / p70 S6 kinase ( as shown by S6 ribosomal protein phosphorylation) and MAPK signalling pathways was clearly detectable in PKD1 / 3 - null B cells ( Fig. 3B).

We show that GATA3 inhibits FOXP3 induction and that IL - 4 limits FOXP3 expression in a GATA3 - mediated way, both in vitro and in vivo.

In contrast, naive T cells could efficiently up - regulate FOXP3 when treated with TGF - beta to induce iTreg cells [ 10, 28 - 34], suggesting that FOXP3 plays an important role in the early differentiation process and may act in a way similar to that known for the Th1 / Th2 decision factors T - bet and GATA3.

In contrast to the Th2 - differentiating and iTreg - inhibiting function of GATA3 in peripheral T cells, GATA3 acts in the thymus together with other transcription factors such as the Repressor of GATA3 ( ROG) in the differentiation process toward CD8 cells [ 53, 54] or participates in complex transcriptional feedback network to regulate sympathoadrenal differentiation [ 55].

The molecular interactions enabling GATA3 to inhibit FOXP3 are not identified yet, but the GATA - binding site is located adjacent to positive, inducing sites, composed of AP - 1 - NFATc2 sites [ 24], and GATA3 may compete with the binding of AP - 1 / NFAT to the promoter ( unpublished observations).

RUNX1 and RUNX3 also work together in the establishment of lineage specification of T lymphocytes ( Taniuchi et al., 2002; Egawa et al., 2007). RUNX1is a frequent target for chromosomal translocations associated with leukemias ( Look, 1997), andRUNX3methylation and silencing is observed in various human epithelial cancers ( Blyth et al., 2005).

They include the crucial choices between cell - cycle exit and continued proliferation, as well as between cell differentiation and self - renewal ( Blyth et al., 2005). Because of the involvement of RUNX mutations in different autoimmune diseases and the known interaction with TGF - beta, we investigated the impact of RUNX1 and RUNX3 on the expression of FOXP3 and subsequently on the development and function of iT reg cells.

Deficiency of RUNX1 or RUNX3 resulted in markedly reduced TGF - beta - mediated induction of FOXP3 mRNA in naive CD4 + T cells compared with control cells transfected with scrambled siRNA.

The increased impact of combined RUNX1 and RUNX3 knockdown implies that RUNX1 and RUNX3 might have redundant functions in the induction of FOXP3.

The NF - kappaB activity, as measured by p65 DNA binding, was induced at 3 - h post - infection in both Tat - positive ( no siRNA and siRNA control) and Tat - negative cells ( siRNA Tat), and increased at 12 h only in Tat - positive cells ( Figure 6B).

Moreover, Tat and p65 were both recruited to the NF - kappaB enhancer of MIP - 1alpha, while the p65 occupancy was abolished by siRNA Tat ( Figure 6G and H).	"Tat	10	13	Protein"	"p65	18	21	Protein"	"MIP - 1alpha	73	85	Protein"	"p65	97	100	Protein"	"siRNA Tat	128	137	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Tat"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""MIP - 1alpha"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""siRNA Tat"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This evidence demonstrated that Tat competed for the binding of IkappaB - alpha to p65 and prevented the IkappaB - alpha repression of p65.

Altogether these results demonstrated that Tat abolished the negative feedback regulation of NF - kappaB by hijacking the IkappaB - alpha repressor, shielding p65 from the IkappaB - alpha embrace, and enforcing the p65 binding to DNA.	"Tat	43	46	Protein"	"IkappaB - alpha	122	137	Protein"	"p65	159	162	Protein"	"IkappaB - alpha	172	187	Protein"	"p65	215	218	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Tat"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IkappaB - alpha"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 162, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""IkappaB - alpha"", ""start_span"": 172, ""end_span"": 187, ""type"": ""Protein""}, {""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 215, ""end_span"": 218, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, Tat likely increased the recruitment of p65 to the NF - kappaB - dependent promoters by associating with p65 and by interfering with the assembly of p65 with the repressor IkappaB - alpha.
