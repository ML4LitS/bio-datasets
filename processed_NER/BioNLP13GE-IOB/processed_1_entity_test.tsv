In addition to playing an important role in the development of the central nervous system [ 8 - 11], cartilage [ 6, 12, 13], and muscle [ 14, 15], it was shown that Sox6 is upregulated in long - term hematopoiesis stem cells ( LT - HSC) compared with multipotent progenitors of adult mouse bone marrow lineage [ 28].	"Sox6	165	169	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sox6"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 169, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In this study, we describe that Sox6 also exerts pleiotropic effects on erythropoiesis.	"Sox6	32	36	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sox6"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The most extreme effect is the persistence of high expression of the embryonic epsilony globin gene.	"epsilony globin	79	94	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""epsilony globin"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This initial observation was confirmed in an independent knock - out allele of Sox6 [ 13] using real - time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) ( unpublished data).	"Sox6	79	83	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sox6"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As shown in Figure 1, the epsilony gene is expressed at high levels at both time points in mutant mice, in contrast to the decline in expression observed in WT mice.	"epsilony	26	34	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""epsilony"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Moreover, the expression level of adult beta globin is also somewhat higher in p100H homozygous mice than in WT mice at 18. 5 dpc ( Figure 1).	"beta globin	40	51	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""beta globin"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Overexpression of Sox6 in GM979 cells by transient transfection leads to a dosage - dependent repression of E - Luc reporter activity ( Figure 2B).	"Sox6	18	22	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sox6"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In contrast, overexpression of a truncated Sox6 protein that lacks its HMG domain [ 32] ( similar to the p100H mouse allele) fails to repress E - Luc activity ( Figure 2B).	"Sox6	43	47	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sox6"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Consistent with the EMSA results, the mutant epsilony promoter reporter constructs ( with either one or both Sox / Sox6 binding sites mutagenized) do not result in significant promoter repression in transfection studies ( Figure 3F).	"epsilony	45	53	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""epsilony"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Normally, the epsilony globin gene is exclusively expressed in primitive erythrocytes and silenced in definitive erythrocytes.	"epsilony globin	14	29	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""epsilony globin"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As expected, epsilony globin is not expressed in the WT 14. 5 - dpc liver, the site of definitive erythropoiesis in the fetus.	"epsilony globin	13	28	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""epsilony globin"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In contrast, abundant ectopic epsilony mRNA expression is seen in the liver of 14. 5 - dpc mutants ( Figure 5 A - D).	"epsilony	30	38	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""epsilony"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The Expression Pattern of Sox6 Suggests a Role in Definitive Erythropoiesis	"Sox6	26	30	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sox6"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To determine the temporal and spatial expression pattern of Sox6, Northern blot and in situ hybridization assays were employed.	"Sox6	60	64	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sox6"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As shown in Figure 6A, Sox6 is detectable by Northern blot beginning at 10. 5 dpc, coincident with the temporal onset of definitive erythropoiesis in the liver.	"Sox6	23	27	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sox6"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore, in situ hybridization shows that Sox6 is highly transcribed in 12. 5 - dpc liver, but not in yolk sac blood islands at 7. 5 dpc ( Figure 6B).	"Sox6	46	50	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sox6"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, Sox6 expression is temporally and spatially coincident with definitive, but not primitive, erythropoiesis.	"Sox6	11	15	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sox6"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Among the other Sox6 effects in erythropoiesis, we have noticed that there are more nucleated red blood cells circulating in p100H mutant mice than in WT mice at 14. 5 dpc and 18. 5 dpc ( Figure 7A).	"Sox6	16	20	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sox6"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In this report, we show that Sox6 is a novel factor in the complicated regulation mechanism of globin genes.	"Sox6	29	33	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sox6"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In addition, Sox6 binds more strongly to an HMG - box dimer motif than to a single HMG - box motif [ 5].	"Sox6	13	17	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sox6"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, it appears that target genes for group D Sox proteins, such as Sox6, probably harbor pairs of HMG binding sites with a configuration compatible with binding of D - Sox protein dimers.	"Sox6	74	78	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sox6"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Sox6 might interact with these factors and form a large repression complex.	"Sox6	0	4	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sox6"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, one attractive model to explain how Sox6 proteins control gene expression is that they function as architectural factors bound to DNA, influencing local chromatin structure by bending DNA and by assembling multiprotein transcriptional complexes.	"Sox6	47	51	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sox6"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
By changing the local chromatin structure, Sox6 could either interfere with binding of other activators to the promoter or facilitate binding of other repressors.	"Sox6	43	47	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sox6"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Moreover, in situ hybridization clearly shows that the persistent expression of epsilony globin in p100H mutant mice is due to defects in the silencing mechanism of definitive erythropoiesis that takes place in the liver ( Figure 5).	"epsilony globin	80	95	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""epsilony globin"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This demonstrates that ectopic expression of the epsilony globin gene is quite robust in homozygous mutant mice.	"epsilony globin	49	64	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""epsilony globin"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The mechanism by which Sox6 regulates the other embryonic globin genes remains to be elucidated.	"Sox6	23	27	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sox6"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Sox6 has other effects in erythropoiesis, including a delay in enucleation / maturation in p100H mutant mice.	"Sox6	0	4	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sox6"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Alternatively, Sox6 itself may play a role in red cell terminal differentiation, as it has been shown to be an important factor in cardiac [ 15], neuronal [ 10], astrocytic [ 11], and cartilage differentiation programs [ 32, 41 - 44].	"Sox6	15	19	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sox6"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The restoration of normal enucleation of red cells in Sox6 - deficient mouse by postnatal day 10. 5 may result from functional compensation of other Sox proteins ( expressed at later developmental stages), since functional redundancy is a recurring theme with Sox proteins [ 13, 45, 46].	"Sox6	54	58	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Sox6"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
There is significant sequence homology between the human and mouse epsilon promoter regions, and the human promoter contains at least two potential Sox6 binding sites.	"epsilon	67	74	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""epsilon"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Indeed, the existence of a silencer of the human epsilon globin gene has been proposed [ 49, 50].	"epsilon globin	49	63	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""epsilon globin"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Thus, beta - 1 to 3 - D - glucans may induce beneficial effects in the presence of pro - inflammatory responses, downstream of receptor binding and signaling by switching a pro - to an anti - inflammatory IL - 1RA - mediated reaction.

The mechanism by which TRAF1 modulates NF - kappaB activation is still unclear.	"TRAF1	23	28	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TRAF1"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Most probably, TRAF1 competes with TRAF family members for binding to the receptor or other signalling proteins.	"TRAF1	15	20	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TRAF1"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
A genome - wide association study examining more than 300, 000 SNPs among approximately 1, 500 autoantibody - positive RA cases and 1, 800 controls identified a genetic variation at the TRAF1 - complement component 5 locus as an important RA risk locus [ 74].	"TRAF1	186	191	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TRAF1"", ""start_span"": 186, ""end_span"": 191, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Subsequent work indicates that TRAF1 is more likely to be the causative locus [ 75].	"TRAF1	31	36	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TRAF1"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Recent work in a Korean population also demonstrates genetic association of the TRAF1 region with RA [ 76].	"TRAF1	80	85	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TRAF1"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Notably, both miR - 146 and miR - 155 are expressed at higher levels in RA synovial fibroblasts and synovial tissue [ 81, 82], as well as in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of RA patients [ 83].	"miR - 155	28	37	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""miR - 155"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Interestingly, a polymorphism in the 3 ' - UTR of the miR - 146a target gene was recently shown to be associated with RA susceptibility [ 86].	"miR - 146a	54	64	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""miR - 146a"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
miR - 155 overexpression in synovial fibroblasts was able to prevent the TLR and cytokine - inducible expression of specific matrix metalloproteinases that mediate tissue destruction in RA [ 81].

miR - 146 and miR - 155 may therefore be important negative regulators of inflammation in RA and their potential for the development of new treatments is substantial.	"miR - 155	14	23	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""miR - 155"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Besides miR - 146 and miR - 155, a number of other miRNAs with a potential role in the control of NF - kappaB - dependent inflammatory responses in RA pathology were recently identified.

TRAF1, which has no ubiquitin ligase activity, can negatively regulate NF - kappaB activation, most probably by competing with other TRAFs.	"TRAF1	0	5	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TRAF1"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

A20 deficient macrophages were hyperresponsive to double stranded RNA and IAV infection, as illustrated by enhanced NF - kappaB and IRF3 activation, concomitant with increased production of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and type I interferon.	"IRF3	132	136	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IRF3"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Both receptors contribute to the proinflammatory response to IAV, but the initiation of the innate antiviral immune response largely depends on RIG - I mediated signaling [ 13].	"RIG - I	144	151	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RIG - I"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
RIG - I contains a C - terminal DExD / H box helicase domain, which is required for ligand recognition, and two N - terminal CARD domains.	"RIG - I	0	7	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RIG - I"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We next investigated whether A20 also inhibits IRF7 activation.	"IRF7	47	51	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IRF7"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To study the effect of endogenously expressed A20 on RIG - I - induced signaling in a more immunological relevant context, we performed further experiments in A20 deficient primary macrophages.	"RIG - I	53	60	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RIG - I"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Compared to wild type BMBM, A20 deficient cells showed enhanced NF - kappaB activation as indicated by increased phosphorylation and sustained degradation of IkappaBalpha ( figure 1B).	"IkappaBalpha	158	170	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IkappaBalpha"", ""start_span"": 158, ""end_span"": 170, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore, nuclear translocation of the p65 NF - kappaB subunit was enhanced in poly ( I: C) transfected A20myel - KO BMDM, reaching a maximum at earlier time points compared to wild type cells ( figure 1C).	"p65	42	45	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Using immunoblotting with an antibody directed against phosphorylated Ser396, maximum IRF3 phosphorylation was detected at earlier time points in A20myel - KO BMDM compared to wild type BMDM ( figure 1B).	"IRF3	86	90	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IRF3"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Unlike our observations with in vitro stimulated primary macrophages we could not detect a significant increase in MCP - 1 or IFNalpha production in the lungs of A20myel - KO animals ( figure 3C).	"MCP - 1	115	122	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MCP - 1"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Although we could detect a significant increase in monocyte ( CD11b + Ly6C +) recruitment at day 4 post infection, this was not evident at later time points after infection ( figure 3D), which is consistent with the equal expression of MCP - 1 in both groups of mice.	"MCP - 1	236	243	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MCP - 1"", ""start_span"": 236, ""end_span"": 243, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The number of resident alveolar macrophages ( autofluorescent + CD11c + F4 / 80 + CD11b -) was also elevated in A20myel - KO mice but did not differ significantly between IAV infected or mock infected mice ( figure 3D).	"F4 / 80	72	79	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""F4 / 80"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Also, the number of GrB and IFNgamma CD8 + T cells as well as IFNgamma expression levels in the lungs were not altered by the absence of A20 in myeloid cells ( figure S2A - C).	"GrB	20	23	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""GrB"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Again, MCP - 1 production was not increased and even lower in A20myel - KO mice ( figure 4C), and also monocyte recruitment was not different between both groups of mice.	"MCP - 1	7	14	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MCP - 1"", ""start_span"": 7, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
A20 is believed to exert its NF - kappaB and IRF3 inhibitory functions by modulating the ubiquitination status of different signaling proteins [ 80].	"IRF3	45	49	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IRF3"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Whether similar mechanisms are involved in the regulation of RIG - I induced NF - kappaB activation is still unclear.	"RIG - I	61	68	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RIG - I"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It cannot be excluded however that A20 also targets other substrates that mediate NF - kappaB and IRF3 activation in myeloid cells.	"IRF3	98	102	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IRF3"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The clear protective phenotype of A20myel - KO mice that we here describe indicates that A20 expression in myeloid cells is a central gatekeeper of RIG - I induced signaling in response to IAV infection and that other DUBs cannot substitute for A20 deficiency under physiological conditions.

Thereafter, we performed Fluoro - Jade B staining and immunohistochemical studies for TNF - alpha and NF - kappaB subunits.	"TNF - alpha	86	97	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNF - alpha"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Following SE, most activated microglia showed strong TNF - alpha immunoreactivity.	"TNF - alpha	53	64	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNF - alpha"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In addition, TNF p75 receptor expression was detected in endothelial cells as well as astrocytes.	"TNF p75 receptor	13	29	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNF p75 receptor"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In addition, only p65 - Thr435 phosphorylation was increased in endothelial cells accompanied by SMI - 71 expression ( an endothelial barrier antigen).	"p65	18	21	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore, sTNFp55R infusion reduced SE - induced neutrophil infiltration in the PC.	"sTNFp55R	13	21	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""sTNFp55R"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
TNF - alpha is expressed at low levels in normal brain and is rapidly upregulated in glia, neurons and endothelial cells in various pathophysiological conditions, including SE [ 17, 18].

However, the relationship between the TNF - alpha system and BBB disruption / neutrophil infiltration during vasogenic edema formation induced by epileptogenic insults has not been fully clarified.	"TNF - alpha	38	49	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNF - alpha"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the roles of TNF - alpha in vasogenic edema and its related events in rat epilepsy models provoked by pilocarpine - induced SE.	"TNF - alpha	62	73	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNF - alpha"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The dosage of sTNFp55R was determined as the highest dose that induced SE of comparable severity in 100% of animals with 5% mortality in the preliminary study.	"sTNFp55R	14	22	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""sTNFp55R"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, the dose of sTNFp55R was 0. 6 mug / day per each animal.	"sTNFp55R	23	31	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""sTNFp55R"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, our experimental schedules at least inhibit the function of TNF - alpha from 3 days prior to SE to 4 days after SE when the volume of vasogenic edema peaked.	"TNF - alpha	66	77	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNF - alpha"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

In 12 hr - post SE animals of the saline - infused group, most of the activated microglia showed strong TNF - alpha immunoreactivity ( Figure 1A).	"TNF - alpha	104	115	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNF - alpha"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Therefore, we determined that 3 days after SE was the best time point to evaluate the effect of sTNFp55R infusion on both vasogenic edema and neuronal damages induced by SE.	"sTNFp55R	96	104	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""sTNFp55R"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In sTNFp55R - treated animals, SE - induced vasogenic edema was attenuated to 9. 8 + / - 0. 7 mm3 ( Figures 2C and 2E).	"sTNFp55R	3	11	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""sTNFp55R"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, sTNFp55R infusion attenuated SE - induced vasogenic edema and neuronal damage compared to saline - infused animals ( p < 0. 05).	"sTNFp55R	6	14	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""sTNFp55R"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It is well established that TNF - alpha is one of the major stimuli toward phosphorylation of NF - kappaB.	"TNF - alpha	28	39	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNF - alpha"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To confirm TNF - alpha - mediated signaling following SE, we performed an immunohistochemical study using five phospho - NF - kappaB antibodies.	"TNF - alpha	11	22	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNF - alpha"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In contrast, p65 - Thr435 phosphorylation was increased in endothelial cells ( not astrocytes) within the PC of saline - infused animals 12 hr after SE ( Figure 5A).	"p65	13	16	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This reduction in SMI - 71 was accompanied by increased p65 - Thr435 phosphorylation ( Figures 5C - D).	"p65	56	59	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, the degree of SMI - 71 immunoreactivity was inversely correlated to p65 - Thr435 phosphorylation with a linear coefficient of correlation of - 0. 6324 ( p < 0. 05; Figure 4C).	"p65	79	82	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Similarly, 1 day - post - SE animals of the sTNFp55R - infused group showed neutrophil infiltration into the PC 1 day after SE ( Figure 6A).	"sTNFp55R	44	52	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""sTNFp55R"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The number of neutrophils / area in the PC region ( including the vasogenic edema region and the non - vasogenic edema region) of sTNFp55R - infused animals was significantly lower than that of the saline - infused group ( Figure 6D, p < 0. 05).	"sTNFp55R	130	138	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""sTNFp55R"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, there was no difference in neutrophil infiltration per unit area of vasogenic edema between the saline - and sTNFp55R - infused groups ( Figure 6D).	"sTNFp55R	118	126	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""sTNFp55R"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, our findings indicate that SE - induced neutrophil infiltration into the PC may be correlated to TNF - alpha - mediated vasogenic edema formation.	"TNF - alpha	108	119	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNF - alpha"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Consistent with our previous study [ 20], some MIP - 2 - positive astrocytes were observed in the core and periphery of the vasogenic edema lesions, but not in the non - vasogenic edema region ( Figure 6B and 6C).	"MIP - 2	47	54	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MIP - 2"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore, the number of MIP - 2 - positive cells showed a direct proportion to the unit area of vasogenic edema with a linear coefficient of correlation of 0. 682 ( p < 0. 05, Figure 6G).	"MIP - 2	27	34	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""MIP - 2"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The major findings in the present study are that TNF - alpha signaling showed cellular specific responses of NF - kappaB phosphorylation in the PC following SE, which may be related to vasogenic edema formation followed by neutrophil infiltration.

In the present study, TNF - alpha immunoreactivity was obviously observed in microglia in the PC following SE.	"TNF - alpha	22	33	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNF - alpha"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These findings indicate that TNF - alpha may participate in astroglial and endothelial responses to SE, which are relevant to SE - induced vasogenic edema formation [ 5 - 8].	"TNF - alpha	29	40	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNF - alpha"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Indeed, TNF - alpha signaling increases BBB permeability in various experimental disease models [ 29].	"TNF - alpha	8	19	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNF - alpha"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In the present study, sTNFp55 infusion could not completely prevent SE - induced vasogenic edema and neuronal damage in the PC.	"sTNFp55	22	29	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""sTNFp55"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, our findings suggest that TNF - alpha signaling may not be a unique upstream event in vasogenic edema development.	"TNF - alpha	37	48	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNF - alpha"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In the present study, p65 - Thr435 immunoreactivity was detected in endothelial cells, and its immunoreactivity showed an inverse correlation to the degree of SMI - 71 expression.	"p65	22	25	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""p65"", ""start_span"": 22, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore, sTNFp55R infusion effectively prevented SE - induced SMI - 71 down - regulation.	"sTNFp55R	13	21	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""sTNFp55R"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

With respect to the present and our previous reports, it is therefore likely that vasogenic edema induced by TNF - alpha can induce neutrophil infiltration and press injury to evoke neuronal - astroglial loss in the PC, unlike other brain regions.

We show that NFAT5 gene and protein expression are strongly induced by MTb, which is a Toll - like receptor ( TLR) ligand, and that an intact NFAT5 binding site in the viral promoter of R5 - tropic HIV - 1 subtype B and subtype C molecular clones is required for efficent induction of HIV - 1 replication by MTb.

Furthermore, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines produced by the human host in response to MTb infection activate signal transduction pathways in CD4 T cells and monocytic cells that also result in transcriptional activation of the HIV - 1 LTR [ 4] - [ 6].

TRAF6 activates IkappaB kinase ( IKK) and mitogen - activated protein ( MAP) kinases that, in turn, ultimately induce activation of specific transcription factor families, including the NF - kappaB and AP - 1 families, which have been shown to associate with the HIV - 1 LTR and to drive its transcription ( [ 22], [ 25] - [ 27], reviewed in [ 10]).

To compare the functional impact of MTb stimulation on subtype - specific HIV - 1 LTR activity, we first constructed reporter plasmids containing viral subtype B, C, and E LTRs ( - 208 to + 64 nt relative to the transcription start site) linked to the firefly luciferase reporter gene.

We examined the requirement of NFAT5 for MTb - induced LTR activity by transfecting a wild - type and NFAT5 mutant LTR reporter construct into THP - 1 cells, followed by stimulation with an MTb lysate.

MTb increases NFAT5 mRNA levels in human MDM	"NFAT5	14	19	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Given that macrophages, which are the primary target of MTb infection, are also a major reservoir of HIV - 1 as infection progresses [ 40], we next investigated whether MTb is able to directly enhance NFAT5 mRNA expression in primary human MDM.	"NFAT5	201	206	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 201, ""end_span"": 206, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We prepared MDM from five normal donors, stimulated the cells with the MTb lysate or left them unstimulated, and measured NFAT5 gene expression levels by quantitative real - time PCR at 24 and 48 hours.	"NFAT5	122	127	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We also investigated whether HIV - 1 infection is capable of inducing NFAT5 mRNA synthesis by infecting MDM with live or heat - inactivated R5 - tropic representatives of subtype B ( HIV - 1Bal), C ( HIV - 198IN22), or E ( HIV - 192TH64).	"NFAT5	70	75	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, MTb specifically enhances NFAT5 mRNA expression in human MDM, and this response continues to increase for at least 48 hours post - stimulation ( Figure 2A).	"NFAT5	32	37	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

To extend the results we obtained in the reporter assays to a physiological TB / HIV co - infection model, we next tested the effect of siRNA - mediated ablation of NFAT5 mRNA levels in MDM co - infected with a subtype B HIV - 1Lai infectious molecular clone and a clinical isolate of MTb.	"NFAT5	165	170	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 170, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We used this approach to ensure that our analysis of the roles of NF - kappaB and NFAT5 in MTb - induced HIV - 1 replication could be interpreted in the proper context of previous research findings that examined LTR regulation in the context of full - length viral replication [ 41] - [ 46].	"NFAT5	82	87	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We note that we confirmed that HIV - 1Lai / Bal - Env grew in PBMC at a similar rate to wild - type HIV - 1Bal, indicating proper co - receptor engagement and internalization of this infectious clone ( data not shown).	"Env	50	53	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Env"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
As shown in Figure 2C, HIV - 1 replication was suppressed at days 6 and 9 post - infection in the NFAT5 siRNA - treated cells as compared to cells treated with control siRNA, and it was significantly inhibited by day 12 post - infection ( p < 0. 05) ( Figure 2C).	"NFAT5	98	103	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, knock down of NFAT5 expression significantly impairs HIV - 1 subtype B replication in MDM co - infected with MTb.	"NFAT5	20	25	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
NF - kappaB and NFAT5 binding to the HIV - 1 LTR can be specifically disrupted	"NFAT5	16	21	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This series of experiments also allowed us to dissect the relative importance of NFAT5 and NF - kappaB binding to the HIV - 1 LTR in MTb regulation of HIV - 1 replication.	"NFAT5	81	86	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To perform these experiments, we constructed a panel of infectious HIV - 1Lai / Bal - env molecular clones where either the NFAT5 site was specifically disrupted or the two NF - kappaB binding sites were either individually or dually disrupted ( Figure 3A).	"env	86	89	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""env"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We also created a double NF - kappaB site mutant virus ( HIV - 1Lai / Bal - env - kappaB I + II - Mut) in order to test the impact of complete disruption of NF - kappaB binding to the HIV - 1 LTR on MTb regulation.	"env	76	79	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""env"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, recombinant NFAT5 binding to the single and the double NF - kappaB mutant LTRs was not impaired and indeed appeared enhanced ( compare lanes 2 - 5 to lanes 7 - 20 of Figure 3D).	"NFAT5	21	26	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
NF - kappaB and NFAT5 binding play independent activating roles in MTb - mediated induction of HIV - 1 replication	"NFAT5	16	21	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
After overnight infection, cells were co - infected with MTb ( CDC1551) or mock - infected and free virus levels were detected by measuring p24 levels in culture supernatants at days 4, 7, and 12 post - HIV - 1 infection.	"p24	140	143	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""p24"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, the replication of each mutant virus was impaired to a more significant extent in the context of MTb co - infection, consistent with important roles for both NF - kappaB and NFAT5 in MTb - induced HIV - 1 replication.	"NFAT5	183	188	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 183, ""end_span"": 188, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
When the cultures were co - infected with MTb, p24 levels increased when the cells were infected with either the wild - type or, to lower levels, with the kappaB - I mutant virus ( Figure 5B).	"p24	47	50	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""p24"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Notably, although replication of the mutant virus with the single, proximal NF - kappaB binding site mutation in the shared NFAT5 / NF - kappaB element ( HIV - 1Lai / Bal - env - kappaB I - Mut) was diminished, this was not significant at day 12 ( Figures 5B - 5D).	"env	173	176	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""env"", ""start_span"": 173, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We note that overall p24 levels were noticeably lower in the cultures co - infected with MTb compared with those infected with HIV - 1 alone.	"p24	21	24	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""p24"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Given that NF - kappaB is efficiently activated in primary MDM in response to TLR agonists [ 51] and as we have shown in Figure 2, NFAT5 gene expression is also induced by TLR agonists, MDM are a suitable experimental system to analyze the effect of NF - kappaB versus NFAT5 binding site mutations on virus replication in isolated MDM in the absence or presence of MTb co - infection.	"NFAT5	131	136	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
NFAT5 is important for enhancement of HIV - 1 subtype C replication in response to MTb infection	"NFAT5	0	5	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We thus next extended our analysis of the role of NFAT5 in MTb / HIV - 1 co - infection to a subtype C isolate.	"NFAT5	50	55	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, even when three functional NF - kappaB binding sites are present in the LTR, as in the HIV - 1 subtype C infectious clone studied here, disruption of NFAT5 binding to the LTR impairs virus replication in response to MTb co - infection.	"NFAT5	156	161	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 156, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The transcription factor NFAT5 is the most evolutionarily divergent member of the Rel family of NFAT proteins [ 57].	"NFAT5	25	30	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To date, osmotic stress, integrin activation, and T cell - stimulation have been shown to regulate NFAT5 activity [ 59], [ 64], [ 65].	"NFAT5	99	104	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We have linked this observation to MTb - stimulated HIV - 1 gene expression by showing that MTb enhances the replication of HIV - 1 subtypes B and C via a direct interaction between NFAT5 and the viral promoter.	"NFAT5	182	187	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 182, ""end_span"": 187, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, HIV - 1 has co - opted NFAT5, which is induced as part of the innate immune response to TB, for enhanced viral transcription / replication.	"NFAT5	29	34	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, NF - kappaB binding to the viral LTR is not sufficient to compensate for the loss of NFAT5 binding to the LTR under conditions of MTb co - infection.	"NFAT5	91	96	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Because NF - kappaB site I overlaps the NFAT5 binding site, it is possible that loss of NF - kappaB binding to this site is mitigated, at least in part, by increased NFAT5 binding to the mutated site.	"NFAT5	40	45	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Other studies have found that, in response to TNF, subtype C LTRs drive reporter gene transcription more strongly than other subtype LTRs [ 38], [ 39].	"TNF	46	49	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNF"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Given that the NF - kappaB and NFAT5 binding motifs overlap, how do NF - kappaB and NFAT5 function at this overlapping or shared site in the LTR to drive viral transcription in response to MTb infection?	"NFAT5	31	36	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
While NF - kappaB presence in the nucleus declines in the hours post MTb infection [ 74], [ 75], NFAT5 levels escalate.	"NFAT5	97	102	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore, hypertonic stress of mouse renal collecting duct epithelial cells results in NFAT5 and NF - kappaB complex formation at NF - kappaB - dependent gene promoters [ 77].	"NFAT5	90	95	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, there are precedents for imagining that NFAT5 could function at the HIV - 1 LTR by inducing histone remodeling in a manner similar to NF - kappaB ( [ 69], reviewed in [ 68], [ 70]) or by directly interacting with NF - kappaB in a cooperative manner.	"NFAT5	46	51	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that NFAT5 is required for the replication of R5 - tropic subtype B and subtype C HIV - 1 isolates in response to MTb - co - infection of human PBMC and MDM.	"NFAT5	41	46	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""NFAT5"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Taken together, the findings presented here enhance the general understanding of the innate immune response to MTb infection by showing that NFAT5 is a major mediator of TLR - dependent gene expression; its importance for gene regulation is likely applicable to other MTb - and TLR - regulated genes.

Thus, it is possible that inhibition of NF - kappaB could be involved in CCR5 mediated tumor development.	"CCR5	73	77	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CCR5"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
On the other hand, the IL - 1Ra is a negative regulator of the inflammatory response.	"IL - 1Ra	23	31	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 1Ra"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Several studies have demonstrated the ability of IL - 1Ra to abrogate the proinflammatory effects of IL - 1.	"IL - 1Ra	49	57	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 1Ra"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Smith et al. suggested that the regulation of IL - 1Ra gene expression is a complex event involving the interactions of three different transcription factors; NF - kappaB / PU. 1 / GA - binding protein binding site [ 35].	"IL - 1Ra	46	54	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 1Ra"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Because IL - 1 has been shown to be an inducer of NF - kappaB activation [ 38], we hypothesized that the expression of IL - 1Ra could play an important role in the autocrine activation of transcription factors NF - kappaB or vice versa.

To investigate whether the inhibition of tumor growth in CCR5 - / - mice is related to tumor - specific immune responses, we analyzed the distribution patterns of CD8 + cytotoxic T cell and CD57 + Natural Killer cells in tumor and spleen tissues.	"CCR5	57	61	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CCR5"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
By staining the tumor sections from CCR5 - / - mice, we found that there was a significant influx of CD8 + cells into the tumor, as well as an increase in the number of infiltrating NK cells ( Figure 5A).	"CCR5	36	40	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CCR5"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
These data suggest that by promoting the infiltration of CD8 T cells and NK cells, which are potent cytotoxic effectors for tumors, could play a role in an anti - tumor effect in CCR5 - / - mice.

"CCR5	187	191	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CCR5"", ""start_span"": 187, ""end_span"": 191, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This anti - tumor activity was also associated with decreased expression of NF - kappaB target anti - apoptotic, cell proliferative, and tumor promoting genes ( Bcl - 2 and C - IAP1) but with increased expression of their target apoptotic genes; cleaved caspase - 3 and 9, and Bax ( Figure 3A - D).

In the tumor and the spleen, the number of cytotoxic CD8 + T cells, CD57 + natural killer cells, and the levels of IL - 1Ra were increased ( Figure 4 and 5).	"IL - 1Ra	115	123	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 1Ra"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In the melanoma tumor tissues of the CCR5 - / - mice, the expression of NF - kappaB target cell death genes ( Bax, caspase - 3 and 9) and the DNA binding activity of NF - kappaB, were significantly inhibited, but the expression of cell death inhibitory NF - kappaB target genes, such as Bcl - 2 and cIAP were enhanced.	"CCR5	37	41	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CCR5"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, the inhibitions of NF - kappaB activity and the expression of target genes are critical in the inhibition of tumor growth in CCR5 - / - mice.	"CCR5	131	135	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CCR5"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Although the mechanism is not clear as to how CCR5 - / - downregulates NF - kappaB, it is noteworthy that NF - kappaB is activated or inactivated by many cytokines.	"CCR5	46	50	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CCR5"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Inflammatory cytokines, including IL - 1, IL - 6 and IL - 8, activate NF - kappaB pathways in tumor cells [ 41].	"IL - 6	42	48	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 6"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

The results of various studies over the past 10 years indicate that the major function of IL - 1Ra is to regulate the pleiotropic effects of IL - 1 by competitively blocking its functions [ 47].

These data support the important premise that inhibition of tumor growth in CCR5 - / - mice could be related with the inhibition of immune escape.	"CCR5	76	80	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CCR5"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Similar to this finding, we found that the CCR5 + / + mice injected with melanoma cells apparently have a lower number of cytotoxic T cells ( CD8 + positive T Lymphocytes cells) and natural killer cells ( CD57 positive NK cells), as well as dendrite cells, in spleen tissues compared to those without melanoma cells.	"CCR5	43	47	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CCR5"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
But the lymphocytes of the CCR5 - / - mice did not decrease when injected with melanoma cells.	"CCR5	27	31	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CCR5"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, relatively increased tumor associated cytotoxic lymphocytes could play an important role in inhibiting the tumor growth in CCR5 - / - mice.	"CCR5	129	133	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""CCR5"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Inhibition of NF - kappaB activity prevented NK cell depletion, and thus increased anti - tumor activity by decreasing IL - 6 production [ 50].	"IL - 6	119	125	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 6"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Thus, the decreased NF - kappaB and elevated IL - 1Ra could also be associated in the infiltration of cytotoxic lymphocytes into tumor, resulting in tumor growth inhibition.	"IL - 1Ra	45	53	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 1Ra"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It is also noteworthy that IL - 1Ra inhibited melanoma tumor growth by increasing the number of myeloid suppressor cells in tumor [ 25].	"IL - 1Ra	27	35	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""IL - 1Ra"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

We show that Akt kinase activity is critical for necroptosis in L929 cells and plays a key role in TNFalpha production.	"TNFalpha	99	107	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
During necroptosis, Akt is activated in a RIP1 dependent fashion through its phosphorylation on Thr308.	"RIP1	42	46	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RIP1"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In L929 cells, this activation requires independent signaling inputs from both growth factors and RIP1.	"RIP1	98	102	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RIP1"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In other cell types, such as mouse lung fibroblasts and macrophages, Akt exhibited control over necroptosis - associated TNFalpha production without contributing to cell death.	"TNFalpha	121	129	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Several recent studies [ 10], [ 11], [ 12], [ 13], [ 14] have suggested that JNK kinase activation plays an important role during necroptosis in L929 cells downstream from RIP1 kinase.	"RIP1	172	176	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RIP1"", ""start_span"": 172, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
For example, the transcription factor c - Jun, a key cellular target of JNK activity, was one of the hits in the genome wide siRNA screen [ 10].	"c - Jun	38	45	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""c - Jun"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Activation of JNK in L929 cells has been linked to autocrine TNFalpha synthesis, activation of oxidative stress and induction of autophagy, all of which contribute to necroptosis.	"TNFalpha	61	69	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Curiously, Akt kinase, a key pro - survival molecule and a well - established inhibitor of apoptotic cell death, has also recently been linked to necroptosis in L929 cells [ 16], where insulin - dependent activation of Akt was suggested to promote necroptosis by suppressing autophagy.

In this study, we expanded these observations to delineate the specific contributions and molecular ordering of the Akt and JNK pathways downstream from RIP1 kinase during necroptosis.	"RIP1	153	157	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RIP1"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

It has been established that mouse fibrosarcoma L929 cells undergo necroptotic cell death following stimulation with TNFalpha [ 10], [ 17].	"TNFalpha	117	125	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In addition, inhibition of caspase - 8 activity alone, either through siRNA knockdown or by using the pan - caspase inhibitor, zVAD. fmk, is sufficient to trigger necroptosis in these cells [ 10], [ 14].	"caspase - 8	27	38	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""caspase - 8"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The addition of growth factors, such as bFGF, restored zVAD. fmk induced death under serum free conditions ( Fig. 1B).	"bFGF	40	44	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bFGF"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore, growth factor - dependent necroptosis required the inhibition of caspase activity, as bFGF alone did not induce cell death ( Fig. 1C).	"bFGF	99	103	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""bFGF"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Previously we described the development of 7 - Cl - O - Nec - 1 ( Nec - 1) as a potent and selective inhibitor of RIP1 kinase and necroptosis ( Fig. S1A) [ 23], [ 24].	"RIP1	114	118	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RIP1"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This inhibitor efficiently blocked growth factor / zVAD. fmk - induced necroptosis under serum free conditions in L929 cells and both zVAD. fmk and TNFalpha - induced necroptosis under full serum conditions ( Fig. 1B, S1B).	"TNFalpha	148	156	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This confirms that RIP1 kinase is responsible for necroptosis in L929 cells under both serum and serum free conditions.	"RIP1	19	23	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RIP1"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Inhibition of Akt also protected the cells from growth - factor insensitive death by caused by TNFalpha ( Fig. 2A).	"TNFalpha	95	103	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Consistent with previous reports, the JNK inhibitor SP600125 protected the cells from both zVAD. fmk and TNFalpha induced death ( Fig. 2A, B and Fig. S2A) [ 12], [ 14].	"TNFalpha	105	113	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In contrast, inhibition of two other MAPKs, p38 and ERK, previously reported not to be activated during necroptosis [ 14], did not protect from either zVAD. fmk or TNFalpha induced death ( Fig. 2A).	"TNFalpha	164	172	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 172, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To understand the activation of Akt and JNK under necroptotic conditions, we examined the changes in Akt and JNK phosphorylation at 9 hrs post zVAD. fmk and TNFalpha stimulation.	"TNFalpha	157	165	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 165, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Following stimulation with either zVAD. fmk or TNFalpha we observed a robust increase in Akt phosphorylation at a known major activation site, Thr308 ( Fig. 3A).	"TNFalpha	47	55	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Similarly, Nec - 1 prevented the induction of JNK phosphorylation in response to zVAD. fmk and substantially reduced this change after TNFalpha addition.	"TNFalpha	135	143	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We observed some changes in total protein levels of JNK and c - Jun following necroptotic stimulation.	"c - Jun	60	67	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""c - Jun"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Some of these changes, e. g. zVAD. fmk - induced increase in c - Jun, were also attenuated by Nec - 1.	"c - Jun	61	68	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""c - Jun"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This established that Akt Thr308 and JNK phosphorylation during necroptosis is RIP1 dependent.	"RIP1	79	83	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RIP1"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
To better understand the contributions of growth factors and RIP1 kinase to necroptotic regulation of Akt, we next analyzed the time course of these phosphorylation changes under serum free conditions.	"RIP1	61	65	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RIP1"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We confirmed the kinetics of the Akt Thr308 and Ser473 phosphorylation changes using a quantitative ELISA assay, which also showed a robust delayed necroptosis - specific RIP1 - dependent increase in Akt Thr308 phosphorylation ( Fig. S3D, E).	"RIP1	171	175	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RIP1"", ""start_span"": 171, ""end_span"": 175, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Taken together, these results indicate that the observed delayed increases in Akt and JNK phosphorylation, preceding the onset of cell death, represent specific consequences of necroptotic signaling downstream from RIP1 kinase.

In contrast, activation of JNK by TNFalpha followed different kinetics from zVAD. fmk - induced changes.	"TNFalpha	34	42	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We next investigated if the delayed RIP1 kinase - dependent increase in Akt Thr308 phosphorylation functionally contributes to the execution of necroptotic cell death.	"RIP1	36	40	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RIP1"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
In the case of pFoxO1 we occasionally observed a shift in migration rather than an increase in band intensity ( e. g. comparing Fig. 5A and B), suggesting that phosphorylation events in addition to Thr24 take place during necroptosis.

"Overall, these data suggested that a significant part of the "" canonical "" Akt signaling network is activated at the onset of necroptotic cell death in a RIP1 dependent fashion."	"RIP1	154	158	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RIP1"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
We found that inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mTOR co - factor Raptor [ 29], protected cells from necroptosis ( Fig. 5C).	"Raptor	86	92	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Raptor"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Knockdown of mTOR using siRNA further validated the small - molecule inhibitor data indicating a role for mTOR in necroptosis by protecting cells from both zVAD. fmk and TNFalpha induced death ( Fig. 5D).	"TNFalpha	170	178	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 170, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
[ 10] have recently reported that the induction of necroptosis by zVAD. fmk in L929 cells is associated with increased synthesis of TNFalpha, which potentiates cell death.	"TNFalpha	132	140	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, we examined whether Akt and its effectors contribute to TNFalpha synthesis.	"TNFalpha	67	75	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
JNK is a well - established regulator of TNFalpha synthesis in a variety of systems [ 13], [ 14], [ 15], [ 34].	"TNFalpha	41	49	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Therefore, the ability of Akt and mTORC1 inhibitors to block the increase in TNFalpha mRNA lead us to examine their role in the activation of JNK during necroptosis.	"TNFalpha	77	85	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

Since our results showed that only Thr308 Akt phosphorylation is increased during necroptosis, we next examined whether it is still dependent on PI3K and PDK1.	"PDK1	154	158	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PDK1"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Inhibition of PI3K and PDK1 using the specific inhibitors LY249002 and BX912 [ 36] resulted in the efficient inhibition of cell death and Akt Thr308 phosphorylation ( Fig. S7A - D).	"PDK1	23	27	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""PDK1"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It is important to note that the cells expressing Myr - Akt were viable, grew in a manner indistinguishable from the empty vector control cells, and were not triggered to induce necroptosis by serum starvation ( Fig. 7B).	"Myr - Akt	50	59	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Myr - Akt"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Nec - 1 prevented both Myr - Akt dependent cell death and the necroptosis - specific delayed increase in Akt Thr308 phosphorylation ( Fig. 7B, C).	"Myr - Akt	23	32	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Myr - Akt"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The effect of zVAD. fmk on their phosphorylation varied, likely due to the increased basal activity of Myr - Akt.	"Myr - Akt	103	112	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Myr - Akt"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It has been reported that Ala mutations at Thr308 and Ser473 cause a reduction in the catalytic activity of Akt, while Asp mutants increase activity [ 38].	"Akt	108	111	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Akt"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This suggests that T308D, in spite of being an active Akt construct, may not be a perfect mimic of phosphorylation and this mutant form of the kinase may not have sufficient activity to phosphorylate the entire repertoire of substrates in the cells.	"T308D	19	24	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""T308D"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Our model, based on these results, is that necroptosis - specific Thr308 phosphorylation provides a critical link between necroptotic machinery and Akt kinase, allowing Akt to phosphorylate substrates during necroptosis, promote TNFalpha synthesis, JNK activation and eventual cell death.

After establishing the role of RIP1 kinase - dependent signaling to Akt in L929 cells, we sought to expand our study to other cell types that are known to undergo necroptotic cell death.	"RIP1	31	35	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RIP1"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Similar to L929 cells, a RIP1 kinase dependent increase in the phosphorylation of Thr308 on Akt occurred during necroptosis ( Fig. 8B, D, F) in these cell types.	"RIP1	25	29	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RIP1"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

These data further support the notion that Akt activity is critical for autocrine TNFalpha synthesis, even in the absence of necroptotic cell death, indicating an unexpected differentiation between Akt - mediated inflammatory signaling under necroptotic conditions and cell death per se.

In this study we investigated RIP1 kinase - dependent signaling pathways using mouse fibrosarcoma L929 cells that die by necroptosis when treated with the pan - caspase inhibitor zVAD. fmk.	"RIP1	30	34	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RIP1"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Altogether, our results suggest that Akt kinase is specifically engaged in signaling downstream from RIP1 kinase, which leads to a selective increase in its phosphorylation on Thr308, but not Ser473.

Expression of a constitutively membrane - targeted Akt construct, Myr - Akt, overcomes the requirement for growth factors.	"Myr - Akt	66	75	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Myr - Akt"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
At the same time, expression of Myr - Akt alone is not sufficient for the induction of necroptosis.	"Myr - Akt	32	41	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Myr - Akt"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
A second, RIP1 kinase - dependent input is required for Thr308 phosphorylation of Akt in response to caspase inhibition and is essential for the propagation of the necroptotic signal.	"RIP1	10	14	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RIP1"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, we found that SP600125, which protected L929 cells from death and inhibited TNFalpha production ( Fig. 2A, B S2A S10A), inhibited both basal and post - treatment phosphorylation levels of Akt at both Ser473 and Thr308 ( Fig. S10B).	"TNFalpha	85	93	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
It did not, however, lead to a reduction in TNFalpha production or cell death ( Fig. S10C, D, F, G), suggesting that earlier data with SP600125 protection ( Fig. 2) could reflect off - target effects of this molecule, rather than JNK inhibition.	"TNFalpha	44	52	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Altogether, our results suggest that Akt kinase is specifically engaged in the signaling downstream from RIP1 kinase, which exerts its activity through promoting a selective increase in Akt phosphorylation on Thr308.	"RIP1	105	109	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RIP1"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Expression of constitutively active membrane - targeted Myr - Akt overcomes this requirement.	"Myr - Akt	56	65	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Myr - Akt"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
A second, RIP1 kinase - dependent input is required for Thr308 phosphorylation of Akt, which in turn is required for necroptotic signaling.	"RIP1	10	14	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RIP1"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
First, what is the mechanism of the RIP1 - dependent increase in Akt Thr308 phosphorylation?	"RIP1	36	40	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RIP1"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
One possibility is that RIP1 kinase inhibits a phosphatase that targets Thr308.	"RIP1	24	28	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RIP1"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Interestingly, we observed phosphorylation of Akt by recombinant RIP1 kinase in vitro on Thr146, 195 / 197, and 435 and Ser381 residues.	"RIP1	65	69	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RIP1"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Furthermore, mutating these residues to Ala in Myr - Akt leads to the loss of its ability to promote necroptosis.	"Myr - Akt	47	56	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""Myr - Akt"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
However, we were not able to confirm phosphorylation of these residues on endogenous Akt in L929 cells using either mass spectrometry or western blotting with a phospho - specific antibody raised against Thr435 peptide, suggesting that direct phosphorylation of Akt by RIP1 likely represents an in vitro artifact and does not reflect endogenous regulation.

Second, what are the key substrates of Akt that promote necrotic death and TNFalpha synthesis?	"TNFalpha	75	83	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
Our data demonstrates a new mode of necrosis - specific regulation of Akt by RIP1 kinase.	"RIP1	77	81	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""RIP1"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
The final decision between survival and death may depend on additional, Akt - independent inputs, such as the status of RIP1 kinase, expression of particular oncogenic factors [ 45] or excessive metabolic stress [ 47].

Others, including ourselves in unpublished data, have found that inihibition of autophagy promotes necroptosis by TNFalpha [ 49].	"TNFalpha	114	122	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"
This suggests that the inhibition of autophagy by Akt or mTOR in our system may contribute to necroptosis induced by TNFalpha, however, it is more difficult to reconcile with the positive role of these proteins in zVAD - induced death.	"TNFalpha	117	125	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""TNFalpha"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

This increased production of TNFalpha during necroptosis may also be important for acute necrotizing diseases, such as necrotizing pancreatitis and acute bacterial infections, where hyper - acute inflammation accompanying necrotic cell death is the primary cause of multiple organ failure and patient death.

The full - length WWOX protein is composed of two N - terminal WW domains, a C - terminal short - chain alcohol dehydrogenase / reductase ( SDR) domain, and a proapoptotic C - terminal tail D3 ( Chang et al., 2001, 2007, 2010; Aqeilan et al., 2004, 2007; Hong et al., 2007; Salah et al., 2012) ( Figure 1).

Glioma cells possess CD44 as a receptor for interacting with brain matrix hyaluronan ( Murai et al., 2004; Yoshida et al., 2012), and secrete hyaluronidases and metalloproteinases to facilitate their migration ( Delpech et al., 2002; Junker et al., 2003; Hagemann et al., 2012).

PMA - induced SerpinB2 gene regulation has been extensively studied in human macrophage cell lines [ 45] - [ 47], and has been shown to occur through several proximal and distal AP - 1 responsive elements [ 30]; [ 37]; [ 47] - [ 51].

Specifically, a TATA consensus sequence is located 23 to 29bp upstream from the transcription initiation site, similar to the position of the TATA box of the human SERPINB2 gene [ 53]; [ 54].

To investigate regulatory elements between - 539 and - 189 essential for LPS - inducible transcription, several candidate binding sites for transcription factors previously reported to mediate LPS - inducible transcription in other genes [ 57] were targeted by nucleotide substitution designed to disrupt transcription factor binding to the pGLmP - 539 murine SerpinB2 promoter - luciferase reporter gene construct ( Fig. 4A).

In contrast, mutation of the C / EBP site ( - 203 / - 192) completely eliminated promoter activity, similar to the levels observed for the - 189 SerpinB2 promoter deletion construct.	"SerpinB2	145	153	Protein"	"[{""token"": ""SerpinB2"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Protein""}]"

The LPS - inducible complex was not detected using the mutant C / EBP oligonucleotide probe and could be abolished by an excess of unlabeled double - stranded oligonucleotide, carrying either the same sequence ( Fig. 5B, lanes 4 and 5) or the sequence of a known C / EBP binding site from the rat albumin promoter ( Fig. 5B, lanes 8 and 9), but not by the mutated oligonucleotide ( Fig. 5B, lanes 6 and 7).

The murine SerpinB2 proximal promoter region between nucleotides - 539 and + 92 mediated both PMA - and LPS - inducible gene transcription, with induction by PMA being less intense and more transient than that by LPS.
