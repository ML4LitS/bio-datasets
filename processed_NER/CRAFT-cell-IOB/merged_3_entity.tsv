Analysis of phagocytosis rates by flow cytometric analysis ( FACS) revealed no differences in the efficacy of apoptotic cell uptake between Ptdsr - / - and Ptdsr + / + macrophages and demonstrated no differences in apoptotic cell engulfment between selected time points ( data not shown).	apoptotic cell,110,124,Cell	macrophages,168,179,Cell	apoptotic cell,215,229,Cell	"[{""token"": ""apoptotic cell"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 168, ""end_span"": 179, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cell"", ""start_span"": 215, ""end_span"": 229, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
Moreover, single Ptdsr - / - macrophages could be identified that had engulfed even more apoptotic target cells than had wild - type macrophages ( Figure 7b, d).	macrophages,29,40,Cell	apoptotic target cells,89,111,Cell	macrophages,133,144,Cell	"[{""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic target cells"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
In addition to its suggested importance for phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, it has been proposed that Ptdsr fulfils a second crucial role in regulating and maintaining a non - inflammatory environment upon the recognition of apoptotic cells by macrophages [ 26].	apoptotic cells,60,75,Cell	apoptotic cells,226,241,Cell	macrophages,245,256,Cell	"[{""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 226, ""end_span"": 241, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 245, ""end_span"": 256, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
To analyze whether TNF - alpha release by Ptdsr - / - macrophages can be affected by engulfment of apoptotic cells, we stimulated FLDMs with LPS, apoptotic cells or both.	macrophages,54,65,Cell	apoptotic cells,99,114,Cell	apoptotic cells,146,161,Cell	"[{""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
Quantification of TNF - alpha levels by ELISA after 22 h showed that Ptdsr - deficient macrophages release less TNF - alpha after stimulation with LPS alone, and also after double stimulation of macrophages with LPS and apoptotic cells ( Figure 8d).	macrophages,87,98,Cell	macrophages,195,206,Cell	apoptotic cells,220,235,Cell	"[{""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 195, ""end_span"": 206, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 220, ""end_span"": 235, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
Moreover, the double stimulation demonstrated that the LPS - induced TNF - alpha release by Ptdsr - / - macrophages could be inhibited by co - administration of apoptotic cells to an extent comparable to that seen in wild - type macrophages.	macrophages,104,115,Cell	apoptotic cells,161,176,Cell	macrophages,229,240,Cell	"[{""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 161, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 229, ""end_span"": 240, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test

In many tissues where programmed cell death occurs as a prominent event during embryogenesis, such as remodeling of the genital ridge during gonad morphogenesis and differentiation of the neural tube, we found almost no co - localization of apoptotic cells and macrophages.	cell,33,37,Cell	apoptotic cells,241,256,Cell	macrophages,261,272,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 241, ""end_span"": 256, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 261, ""end_span"": 272, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test

We do not think that the different results observed in Ptdsr - knockout mice in a mixed C57BL / 6 x 129 background and in a pure C57BL / 6J background can be attributed to genetic background effects: comparison of apoptotic cell engulfment efficacies of thioglycollate - elicited macrophages from 129P2 / OlaHsd and C57BL / 6J mice did not show any differences in apoptotic cell uptake ( J.

Removing E2f1 rescues aberrant division of differentiating Rb - deficient retinal neurons, as well as death in cells prone to apoptosis, and restores both normal differentiation and function of major cell types, such as photoreceptors.	neurons,82,89,Cell	cells,111,116,Cell	cell,200,204,Cell	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 200, ""end_span"": 204, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
Its development proceeds through three overlapping steps starting with retinal progenitor cell ( RPC) proliferation, followed by birth of post - mitotic retinal transition cells ( RTCs, also referred to as precursors), and ending with terminal differentiation of seven major cell types ( Figure 1A) [ 1].	cell,90,94,Cell	cells,172,177,Cell	cell,275,279,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 172, ""end_span"": 177, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 275, ""end_span"": 279, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test

Rb binds more than 100 proteins [ 43] and in some non - neuronal cells, such as skeletal muscle, adipocytes, and bone, Rb is thought to bind and potentiate tissue - specific transcription factors that promote differentiation [ 31 - 33].	neuronal,56,64,Cell	cells,65,70,Cell	adipocytes,97,107,Cell	"[{""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""adipocytes"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
The unique effect of E2f3 in disrupting the differentiation of SACs but not other retinal neurons might be due to cell - type - specific expression or cell - type - specific activity of E2f3.	neurons,90,97,Cell	cell,114,118,Cell	cell,151,155,Cell	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 151, ""end_span"": 155, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
For example, in the P20 amygdala, E2f3 colocalized with the general neuronal markers Mtap2 and Mecp2 [ 52], but not with Calb2, which marks a subset of neurons, or with the glial marker Gfap ( data not shown).	neuronal,68,76,Cell	neurons,152,159,Cell	glial,173,178,Cell	"[{""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 152, ""end_span"": 159, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""glial"", ""start_span"": 173, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
E2f3a can trigger cell cycle induction, but because SAC defects are not linked to cell cycle perturbation ( Figures 3A and 4), and in view of the predominant association between E2f3b and Rb in quiescent cells [ 16, 19], we suspected that E2f3b may perturb differentiation in Rb KO SACs.	cell,18,22,Cell	cell,82,86,Cell	cells,204,209,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 204, ""end_span"": 209, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
However, targeted KO and chimeric studies reveal that Rb autonomously promotes cell cycle exit in newborn neurons, and is required for survival of a subset of neurons, particularly in the retina [ 2, 3, 13, 14, 56 - 59].	cell,79,83,Cell	neurons,106,113,Cell	neurons,159,166,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 166, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
This difference might reflect a role for Rb in the development of cones, bipolar cells, or other cells that may contribute to the photopic ERG, including potentially SACs, which do have a serious defect in the Rb / E2f1 DKO retina.	cones,66,71,Cell	bipolar cells,73,86,Cell	cells,97,102,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cones"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""bipolar cells"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
Rb binds more than 100 factors [ 43], and in several non - neuronal cells, such as skeletal muscle, adipocytes, and bone, it binds and potentiates tissue - specific transcription factors that promote differentiation [ 31 - 33].	neuronal,59,67,Cell	cells,68,73,Cell	adipocytes,100,110,Cell	"[{""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""adipocytes"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
