In the laboratory, color variation has been the subject of vertebrate genetics for more than a century ( Searle 1968; Silvers 1979), and many pigmentary components have been identified whose actions are understood in a cellular or organ - based context ( reviewed in Bennett and Lamoreux 2003).

Ventral - specific Agouti isoforms are also expressed in developing skin from embryonic day 10. 5 ( E10. 5) and beyond and may play a role in pigment cell differentiation ( Millar et al. 1995).

The boundary between dorsal and ventral color compartments in at / at mice bears superficial resemblance to dorsoventral boundaries apparent for many other mammals, but morphogenetic differences between dorsal and ventral skin seem likely to include more elements than the type of pigment made by hair follicle melanocytes.

Our results indicate that the apparent uniformity of the dorsoventral boundary represents the sum of independent mechanisms that affect melanocyte density and / or differentiation, pigment - type synthesis, and hair length; surprisingly, none of these coincide with the somite - lateral plate lineage boundary.

Furthermore, dorsoventral differences in pigmentation can represent differences in the number and / or differentiated state of pigment cells, as well as the type of pigment synthesized in response to expression of Agouti.

Melanin content of individual hairs is likely to be influenced both by the number of pigment cells and their follicular environment.	"pigment cells	85	98	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""pigment cells"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This same region may serve as a boundary between dorsal and ventral skin by inhibiting melanocyte differentiation, by promoting pheomelanin synthesis, and by supporting a progressive increase in hair growth from ventrum to dorsum.

While the positional cloning work was underway, one of us ( A. Russ) generated an independent mutation of Tbx15 by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells.	"stem cells	143	153	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""stem cells"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In P3. 5 skin, Tbx15 is expressed in both dorsal and ventral skin, most strongly in the condensed upper dermis and developing dermal sheaths of hair follicles; faint expression can also be detected in rare dermal papillae cells ( Figure 4B).

In P4. 5 skin, expression of Agouti is also extended dorsally in deH / deH animals and is most apparent in the midflank region within the upper dermis and dermal papillae cells ( Figure 6B).

The visual boundary between dorsal and ventral skin in at / at mice is reminiscent of other systems in which adjacent compartments enforce a binary choice between alternative patterns of gene expression and cell fate ( reviewed in Dahmann and Basler 1999).

However, Agouti mRNA in both embryonic and postnatal skin is distributed along a gradient whose dorsal boundary is indistinct and overlaps with two additional gradients recognized by their effects on hair length and histochemical staining for melanocytes.

Cell lineage studies should provide a definitive answer, but we favor the latter hypothesis, because measurements of dorsoventral regions according to hair color in deH / deH mice revealed a small increase of the cream - colored ventral region in addition to the approximate doubling of the yellow flank region ( see Figure 2).	"Cell	0	4	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Cell"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In either case, the targets of Tbx15 action in the skin include genes in addition to Agouti, since hair length and melanocyte distribution exhibit a demonstrable, albeit subtle, alteration in animals that carry a null Agouti allele.

( Ectopic pigmentation of the ventral footpads that develops in En1 mutant mice is unrelated to pigment - type synthesis and instead likely reflects a requirement for En1, independent of Wnt7a, to repress migration or proliferation ( or both) of pigment cells in ventral epidermis [ Cygan et al. 1997; Loomis et al. 1998].)

The lateral somitic frontier, defined as the lineage boundary between somite - derived versus lateral plate - derived mesoderm, is established during somitogenesis early in development ( Mauger 1972; Christ et al. 1983; Olivera - Martinez et al. 2000; Nowicki et al. 2003), but remains distinct in postnatal animals despite the potential for extensive cell mixing ( see Figure 8).

An additional dorsoventral domain that is not externally apparent has emerged from studies of Msx1, whose expression marks a subgroup of somite - derived mesenchymal cells that contribute to dermis in a narrow stripe along the paraspinal region ( Houzelstein et al. 2000).	"mesenchymal cells	154	171	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""mesenchymal cells"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 171, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Thus, there exist at least three distinct boundaries in postnatal mammalian skin that are parallel to the sagittal plane, marked by differences in pigment - type synthesis, differences in cell lineage, and differences in expression of Msx1.

( A) A tricolor pigmentation pattern is generated by the combination of distinct mechanisms that affect distribution of Agouti mRNA and histochemical staining for melanocytes; effects of the latter mechanism by itself are evident in ae / ae mice ( see Figure 1).

Overexpression of Shh in the distal lung epithelium resulted in the absence of functional alveoli and an increase in interstitial tissue caused by an increased proliferation of both epithelial and mesenchyme cells [ 26].

Hepatocyte growth factor / Scatter factor ( HGF) is one potential candidate responsible for the guidance of muscle precursors to the membranous diaphragm.	"muscle precursors	108	125	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""muscle precursors"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Pax3 and MyoD, transcription factors required for appropriate migration and determination of myogenic precursors, were detected in the PPFs of Fog2 lil mice ( data not shown).	"myogenic precursors	93	112	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""myogenic precursors"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We hypothesize that Fog2 is required ( either directly or indirectly) for the induction of HGF in the developing diaphragm, and dysregulation of HGF patterning along the path of muscle precursor cell migration between the PPF and the diaphragm accounts for the abnormal phenotype in these mice.

Muscle precursors destined to populate the diaphragm migrate from the lateral dermomyotome of cervical somites.	"Muscle precursors	0	17	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Muscle precursors"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Muscle precursors reach the PPF by E11, where they proliferate, differentiate, and then migrate toward the dorsolateral costal, sternal costal, and crural regions of the developing diaphragm.	"Muscle precursors	0	17	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Muscle precursors"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We have shown that the Fog2 mutant does have an abnormal pattern of HGF expression in the region through which muscle precursor cells migrate onto the developing diaphragm.

We suggest that the abnormal electroretinograms, slow retinal degeneration, and retinal dysmorphology seen in humans with ESCS may, in part, be attributable to the aberrant function of a hybrid photoreceptor cell type similar to that identified in this study.	"photoreceptor cell	194	212	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptor cell"", ""start_span"": 194, ""end_span"": 212, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Humans with a similar mutation have a form of blindness called enhanced S - cone syndrome ( ESCS).	"cone	76	80	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
It is possible that the abnormal features of these photoreceptors predispose them to undergo premature death.	"photoreceptors	51	65	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptors"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The disease is caused by mutations in the orphan nuclear receptor transcription factor NR2E3 ( also known as photoreceptor nuclear receptor), which is expressed exclusively in rods [ 3, 4].	"rods	176	180	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rods"", ""start_span"": 176, ""end_span"": 180, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The initial reports of patients with ESCS attributed the unusual ERG to an abnormally functioning rod photoreceptor system with persistent activity under light adaptation [ 6 - 8].	"rod photoreceptor	98	115	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rod photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Nevertheless, the overall density of cones was only modestly increased in this patient ( approximately 2 - fold), suggesting that there might be additional factors that contribute to the very large, light - adapted ERG seen in this disease.	"cones	37	42	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cones"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In addition to the ERG findings, patients with ESCS have dysmorphic retinas with rosette formation in the outer nuclear layer ( ONL) where photoreceptor cell bodies reside, and a slow retinal degeneration that can ultimately lead to complete blindness [ 12 - 14].	"photoreceptor cell	139	157	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptor cell"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Curiously, the ERG of the mouse under both light and dark adaptation has been reported to be normal, showing progressive attenuation with time, presumably due to degenerative cell loss [ 15].	"cell	175	179	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 179, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
A prior study showed a 2 - to 3 - fold increase in the number S - opsin - positive cells in the rd7 retina compared to wild type [ 17].	"cells	83	88	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In addition, two groups recently reported derepression of additional cone genes in the rd7 mutant [ 18, 19].	"cone	69	73	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In order to better understand the mechanistic basis of ESCS, we undertook a molecular and ultrastructural analysis of the photoreceptors of the rd7 mutant mouse.	"photoreceptors	122	136	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptors"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Widespread Up - Regulation of Cone Genes in the rd7 Mutant Retina	"Cone	30	34	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Cone"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In addition to these genes, several novel cone - specific genes of unknown function recently identified in our lab were also up - regulated ( Figure 1, genes G16, G17, G21, and G24; unpublished data).	"cone	42	46	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Two Distinct Patterns of Cone Gene Derepression in rd7	"Cone	25	29	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Cone"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In order to confirm these microarray results, an in situ hybridization analysis of the putative up - regulated cone genes was carried out in which the rd7 mutant retina was compared with age - matched, wild - type controls.	"cone	111	115	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We found that the majority of the cone - specific genes that were up - regulated in microarray experiments were derepressed when assessed by in situ hybridization ( Figure 2).	"cone	34	38	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
There were two major patterns of cone gene derepression.	"cone	33	37	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The more common pattern ( type I) manifested itself as ectopic gene expression throughout the ONL, consistent with gene expression in all photoreceptors ( Figure 2; upper left photomicrographs).	"photoreceptors	138	152	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptors"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Dissociated cell in situ hybridization was performed using a probe for the S - cone opsin gene ( Opn1sw), which shows type II derepression ( Figures 2 and 3A - 3C).	"cell	12	16	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The estimate of 1. 65% S - opsin - positive cells in the wild - type retina is in agreement with these data.	"cells	44	49	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Novel Cone - Specific Genes Are Derepressed in rd7	"Cone	6	10	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Cone"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
A number of these novel cone - specific genes showed a striking localization of their transcripts to the photoreceptor inner segment ( e. g., Bub1b and Tcta).	"cone	24	28	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In addition to the ten genes that showed cone - specific expression in the wild - type retina, another 11 novel genes were derepressed in the rd7 retina by in situ hybridization ( Figure 1, genes G36 - G46).	"cone	41	45	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The remainder of the up - regulated genes did not have detectable cone staining in the wild - type retina.	"cone	66	70	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In most cases, the novel cone genes identified in this study appear to have a type I pattern of derepression.	"cone	25	29	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Gnb3 and Thrb2 are two examples of known cone genes with this early pattern of expression ( Figure 5).	"cone	41	45	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Intriguingly, three genes shown to be up - regulated in rd7 on microarray, but that had either no detectable signal by in situ hybridization at adult stages or no apparent change in expression by in situ hybridization between wild type and rd7, also showed this early photoreceptor pattern ( Figure 1, genes G48 - G50).	"photoreceptor	268	281	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 268, ""end_span"": 281, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Only two cone - specific genes failed to show any change in expression by either microarray or in situ hybridization in the rd7 mutant: M - opsin ( Opn1mw) and thyroid hormone receptor beta 2 ( Thrb2) ( Figure S8).	"cone	9	13	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
One further finding to note is that the cell bodies of the M - opsin - positive cells appear to be scattered throughout the ONL in the rd7 mutant at P14 ( Figure S8).	"cells	80	85	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
It is known that until P11, the cell bodies of cone photoreceptors in the mouse are normally dispersed throughout the ONL, only to relocate subsequently to the scleral edge of the ONL around P12 [ 23].

Rod Genes Are Only Modestly and Temporarily Affected in rd7	"Rod	0	3	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Rod"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Microarray and in situ hybridization analysis of numerous rod genes failed to reveal marked changes in expression levels at P14 and P21 ( see Figure 2, lower left photomicrographs; Table S2).	"rod	58	61	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Despite the minimal changes in rod gene expression at later postnatal timepoints, there was evidence of a significant delay in the onset of rhodopsin ( Rho) expression in rd7 mutants relative to wild - type.	"rod	31	34	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In situ hybridization analysis of several rod - specific genes at P6 revealed that rhodopsin alone showed a markedly lower level of expression compared to wild type ( Figure 6; unpublished data).	"rod	42	45	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Analysis of several photoreceptor transcription factors in the rd7 mutant indicated that the levels of Crx and Nrl are unaffected in the mutant at P14 ( see Figure 2, lower right photomicrographs).	"photoreceptor	20	33	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Whereas there was only a barely detectable hint of expression in the inner nuclear layer ( INL) in the wild - type retina, this gene showed strong expression in the middle and vitreal thirds of the INL as well as patchy expression in the ganglion cell layer ( GCL) and at the scleral edge of the ONL in rd7 ( see Table S1).	"cell	247	251	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 247, ""end_span"": 251, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In order to assess the morphologic effects of the above gene expression changes, the ultrastructure of the photoreceptor cell bodies in the rd7 mutant was examined.	"photoreceptor cell	107	125	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptor cell"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In the wild - type mouse, cone cell bodies are aligned along the scleral border of the ONL, and they are larger than those of rods.	"rods	126	130	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rods"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
They also have more abundant electron - lucent euchromatin than rods.	"rods	64	68	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rods"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In contrast to the cone cell body, the wild - type rod soma is small and nearly round.	"rod	51	54	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In addition, comparison of the diagrammatic representation of the wild - type and rd7 ONLs suggests that the average area of the S - opsin - negative cells in rd7 is greater than in the wild - type ( Figure 7C and 7D).	"cells	150	155	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 155, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In order to confirm this impression, we quantitated the area of 50 wild - type and 50 mutant rod - like cell bodies ( see Materials and Methods for details).	"rod	93	96	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Lastly, 38% ( 19 / 50) of the rd7 photoreceptors selected for somal area quantitation had prominent juxtanuclear mitochondria ( red arrow in Figure 7H; unpublished data).	"photoreceptors	34	48	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptors"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We have identified two patterns of cone gene derepression in the rd7 mutant retina, in agreement with a previous report by Chen et al.	"cone	35	39	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In the Nrl homozygous mutant, there is a stronger and more uniform derepression of many cone - specific genes throughout the ONL than is seen in the rd7 retina ( unpublished data).	"cone	88	92	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Quantitation of these supernumerary S - cone opsin - positive cells indicates that they are approximately 2 - fold more abundant than in normal retina, consistent with previous antibody studies [ 17].	"cells	62	67	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Both studies showed that cone genes in addition to S - cone opsin are derepressed in the mouse rd7 mutant.	"cone	25	29	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
[ 19] found by RT - PCR that the levels of several rod - specific genes, including rhodopsin, were modestly reduced in rd7 at P28.	"rod	51	54	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The overall finding of modest reductions in rod - specific gene expression is entirely in keeping with the results of the present study.	"rod	44	47	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In addition to demonstrating derepression of a range of known cone - specific genes in rd7 mutants, Chen et al.	"cone	62	66	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Although we found Elovl2 to have a cone - enriched pattern of expression ( see Figure 1), in situ hybridization analysis of Fabp7 failed to show a signal in wild - type or mutant retina ( unpublished data).	"cone	35	39	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Indirect support for this idea is provided by the observation that Fabp7 is up - regulated by microarray analysis in Nrl and Crx mutant retinas as well ( unpublished data), suggesting that this change may represent a generalized response to injury in the retina rather than derepression of a cone - enriched gene.	"cone	292	296	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 292, ""end_span"": 296, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
First, they identified a zebrafish homolog of Nr2e3 and showed it to be expressed in photoreceptors.	"photoreceptors	85	99	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptors"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The gene expression changes identified in the rd7 mutant retina in the present study suggest the scheme of gene regulation in mouse rods depicted in Figure 8.	"rods	132	136	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rods"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In contrast to the marked derepression of the vast majority of cone - specific genes in the rd7 mutant, two genes stand out as being unaffected by the mutation: the gene encoding M - opsin and Thrb2.	"cone	63	67	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
As Thrb2 is known to be required for the expression of M - opsin [ 22], the absence of supernumerary M - opsin - positive cells may simply be a consequence of the fact that Thrb2 expression is unchanged in the rd7 mutant.	"cells	122	127	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Further support for this idea has been provided by recent work in our lab showing widespread derepression of cone genes in the Notch1 - / - retina ( unpublished data).	"cone	109	113	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The increased expression of Gckr in rd7 mutant retina suggests that it too may be a cone - enriched gene.	"cone	84	88	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
A previous study found that two of these genes, Pygm and Hk2, have markedly elevated tag levels in an ONL - specific serial analysis of gene expression library consistent with their being highly enriched in wild - type photoreceptors [ 34].	"photoreceptors	219	233	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptors"", ""start_span"": 219, ""end_span"": 233, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In fact, there is experimental evidence from the rat to support the conclusion that early - born and late - born rods are intrinsically different [ 37].	"rods	113	117	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rods"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Of course, if this were not the case, this experiment could not rule out the possibility that molecularly distinct populations of rod precursors are present simultaneously in the developing retina.	"rod	130	133	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In this scenario, the absence of Nr2e3 would alter the probability that an unknown master control gene is expressed in rod precursors.	"rod	119	122	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Once this event takes place, it would initiate an irreversible program of differentiation toward S - cone fate, albeit at a relatively low frequency.	"cone	101	105	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The fact that the rd7 mouse has a normal ERG strongly suggests that the aberrant ERG in ESCS is not attributable to the activity of a hybrid photoreceptor identical to that found in this study.	"photoreceptor	141	154	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This conclusion is consistent with the evidence from human ESCS patients indicating a markedly reduced rod system and a lack of measurable rhodopsin by reflection densitometry [ 1, 2, 10, 11].	"rod	103	106	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
These findings, however, do not rule out the possibility that the abnormal human ERG derives from a hybrid photoreceptor cell type that also expresses S - opsin.	"photoreceptor cell	107	125	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptor cell"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
It is possible that there are gene regulatory differences between mice and humans such that in human NR2E3 mutants, S - opsin shows a type I pattern of derepression rather than a type II as in seen in the rd7 mouse, and is therefore expressed in all of the hybrid photoreceptor cells.	"photoreceptor cells	264	283	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptor cells"", ""start_span"": 264, ""end_span"": 283, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
As discussed above, this ratio could depend either on the relative percentages of two distinct rod precursor populations or on stochastic effects on regulatory gene expression.	"rod	95	98	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
It is possible that this degeneration is attributable to the abnormal function of the hybrid photoreceptor cell type characterized in the present study.	"photoreceptor cell	93	111	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptor cell"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The cause of this abnormality is not known, but it is possibly related to defects in photoreceptor cell polarity in the rd7 mutant.	"photoreceptor cell	85	103	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptor cell"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Rosette formation and abnormally wavy epithelia are common sequelae of defects in pathways controlling cell polarity [ 46, 47].	"cell	103	107	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Overexpression of wild - type crumbs in Drosophila has been shown to cause polarity defects leading to waviness of epithelia and even to misalignment of nuclei within photoreceptors analogous to what is seen in the rd7 retina [ 47, 51].	"photoreceptors	167	181	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptors"", ""start_span"": 167, ""end_span"": 181, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

Images of semi - thin sections from the mutant retina were taken within the ventral two - thirds of the retina where the majority of the supernumerary S - opsin - expressing cells reside.	"cells	174	179	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 174, ""end_span"": 179, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
All sections were cut in a plane perpendicular to the plane of the photoreceptor layer.	"photoreceptor	67	80	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

To better understand the role of ATRX in development and the associated abnormalities in the ATR - X ( alpha thalassemia mental retardation, X - linked) syndrome, we conditionally inactivated the homolog in mice, Atrx, at the 8 - to 16 - cell stage of development.

Like the human gene, the mouse Atrx gene is also X - linked, such that a direct disruption of the single Atrx allele in male ES cells would immediately give rise to the null state.	"cells	128	133	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

The failure to recover targeted clones with these vectors suggested that Atrx may be important for normal ES cell growth and expansion and that direct targeting of the single locus may not be possible.

"To generate the full deletion in ES cells, the Atrxflox clones ( 1 / F12 and 1 / G11) were transiently transfected with a Cre - recombinase expression plasmid ( pCAGGS - Cre - IRESpuro), and subclones were recovered bearing an allele ( Atrx Delta 18 Delta neo in Figure 2A) in which both exon 18 and the neor cassette had been deleted by the Cre recombinase ( resulting from the recombination event labelled "" C "" in the Atrxflox allele shown in Figure 2A) ( Figure 2C)."

Equal numbers of Atrx + ( bearing either an AtrxWT or an Atrxflox allele) and Atrxnull ( bearing an Atrx Delta 18 Delta neo allele) ES cells were inoculated into cultures and the mixed cultures were passaged ( 1: 3 split) every 2 d for 8 - 10 d.

The observation that rDNA is hypomethylated in the absence of Atrx, even in ES cells, is consistent with the finding that hypomethylation of the human rDNA repeats is detectable from an early developmental stage in ATR - X patients.

Other mouse repetitive sequence elements surveyed in ES cell DNA include the heterochromatic major satellite ( assayed with MaeII) and minor satellite ( assayed with HpaII) repeats, as well as interspersed retroviral repeats of the intracisternal A particle ( IAP) type and the Line 1 and Sine B1 families ( all assayed with HpaII).

These repeats were found to be moderately ( Line 1 and Sine B1) or highly ( IAP, major satellite, minor satellite) methylated in wild - type ES cells, and this methylation was not detectably perturbed by the absence of Atrx ( Figure S3 and unpublished data).

We also observed very high levels of Atrx expression in trophoblast giant cells ( TGCs) surrounding the Reichert ' s membrane ( Figure 5E).	"trophoblast giant cells	56	79	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""trophoblast giant cells"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

Relative to the very high mitotic index observed in wild - type embryos, the proportion of mitotic cells observed in Atrxnull embryos at 7. 5 dpc was dramatically reduced ( Figure 6B).	"cells	99	104	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
These observations suggest that the mitotic defect observed in embryos is unlikely to be a direct, cell - autonomous effect of the absence of Atrx, and is more likely to be a secondary effect resulting from the failure to develop a normal trophoblast ( see below).

We found that the population of Pl - 1 - expressing cells was depleted in the decidual implantation sites containing Atrxnull embryos relative to those containing wild - type littermates ( Figure 7B); this was also apparent at 7. 5 dpc, as determined by immunohistochemical staining of paraffin sections of embryos in deciduas with an anti - Pl - 1 antibody ( Figure 7C).

To investigate whether the trophoblast defect was restricted to the production of secondary TGCs ( produced by diploid precursors in the ectoplacental cone and derived originally from the polar trophectoderm overlying the inner cell mass of the blastocyst) or also affected the production of primary TGCs ( resulting from differentiation of the mural trophectoderm of the blastocyst), blastocysts ( 3. 5 dpc) from crosses between AtrxWT / flox females and GATA1 - Cre homozygous transgenic males ( AtrxWT / Y; GATA1 - Cre + / +) were cultured in vitro for 5 d to monitor outgrowth of the primary trophoblast.

No difference was observed in the rate or extent of trophoblast outgrowth over 5 d of culture between Atrxnull blastocysts ( Atrxnull / Y, n = 6) and blastocysts bearing an AtrxWT allele ( AtrxWT / WT, n = 6; AtrxWT / null, n = 6; AtrxWT / Y, n = 6) ( examples shown in Figure 7D), suggesting that the defect specifically involves the secondary giant cell compartment.

Although the embryonic compartment of the conceptus appears initially normal, by 7. 5 dpc Atrxnull embryos display abnormalities in development of the trophoblast, including a depletion in the population of TGCs surrounding the conceptus and a reduction in the size of the ectoplacental cone, which contains the diploid giant cell precursors [ 22].

Hand1 is required for terminal differentiation of secondary TGCs, and in its absence trophoblast cells arrest at a precursor stage in the ectoplacental cone [ 17, 28].	"trophoblast cells	85	102	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""trophoblast cells"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
It is noteworthy that, in the brain - specific Atrx knockout mice, the defect was observed in terminally differentiating neurons [ 20].	"neurons	121	128	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
However, it was recently demonstrated that the paternal Atrx ( called Xnp) allele is completely silenced in a normal mouse trophoblast stem cell line [ 32], suggesting that Atrx does not normally escape imprinted X - inactivation in the extraembryonic tissues of wild - type females.	"trophoblast stem cell	123	144	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""trophoblast stem cell"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
"Perhaps a more likely explanation for this phenomenon stems from experimental observations suggesting that imprinted X - inactivation is not imposed on all precursors of the mouse extraembryonic tissues: A subpopulation of cells may escape this process and make a random "" choice "" of which X chromosome will be inactivated."

We found that Apc plays a crucial role in determinations of cell fates during the embryonic development, possibly via temporal and tissue - specific regulation of beta - catenin levels in the skin, its appendages, and in the thymus.

Interestingly, in the mutant skin, in addition to diffuse membrane - bound localization as in the normal skin, cells with strong cytosolic beta - catenin localization were also observed frequently ( Figure 4H and 4H ').

Since the stroma of the medulla is less heavily infiltrated with lymphocytes than the cortex, the medulla stained more lightly than the cortex.	"lymphocytes	65	76	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""lymphocytes"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Immunohistochemistry of normal thymus from P3 to P17 mice showed a similar staining pattern for K14 in that its expression was restricted to a small population of TECs in the inner medullary region and in the keratinocytes in Hassall ' s corpuscles ( Figure 6D).	"keratinocytes	209	222	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""keratinocytes"", ""start_span"": 209, ""end_span"": 222, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Diffuse cytoplasmic staining for beta - catenin was also detected in the medullary epithelial cells ( Figure 6C).	"epithelial cells	83	99	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""epithelial cells"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

K1 staining was not detected in young mice at P3 but in older mice it was detected in differentiated keratinocytes in some of Hassall ' s corpuscles ( Figure S3).	"keratinocytes	101	114	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""keratinocytes"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Localization of K14 was limited to a few cells in the medulla and some overlapped with K8 localization ( Figure 6G).	"cells	41	46	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In the other P3 mutant thymus the distinct thymic epithelial compartments have been lost completely, and only a few lymphocytes were remaining at the edges and some in the middle ( Figure 6H).	"lymphocytes	116	127	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""lymphocytes"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Proliferative activities were no longer observed in thymocytes as prominently as in the normal thymus, but the epithelial cells seemed to be forming concentric structures ( Figure 6I).	"epithelial cells	111	127	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""epithelial cells"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
At P10 - P13, the mutant thymus consisted of numerous enlarged Hassall ' s corpuscle - like structures, made of arrays of K14 - and K8 - expressing keratinizing epithelial cells surrounding large keratin deposits ( Figure 6L and 6O).	"epithelial cells	161	177	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""epithelial cells"", ""start_span"": 161, ""end_span"": 177, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
BrdU incorporation was only observed in very few keratinizing epithelial cells, looking somewhat similar to the pattern of mature skin ( Figure 6M).	"epithelial cells	62	78	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""epithelial cells"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This coincided with fewer immature cells in the older mutant thymus.	"cells	35	40	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Collectively, these results suggest that loss of Apc and consequent stabilization of beta - catenin in K14 - expressing TECs lead to their aberrant proliferation and differentiation to keratinocytes, causing massive squamous metaplasia, rather than to form either medullary or cortical TECs.	"keratinocytes	185	198	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""keratinocytes"", ""start_span"": 185, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
To assess the phenotypic consequences of inactivation of the Apc gene in cells that express K14, we created mice that are homozygous for the ApcCKO allele and contain a K14 - cre transgene.	"cells	73	78	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Our finding that K14 - driven Apc loss in embryonic ectoderm resulted in irregularly spaced and often tightly clustered abnormal hair placode initiation and follicle morphogenesis ( Figures 4F, 5B, 5D, and 5F) as well as in the development of multiple tooth buds ( Figure 4O and 4P), is in line with the effects seen in activation of epithelial beta - catenin signaling during placode formation, indicating the role of Apc in specification of embryonic ectodermal stem cells to produce a hair follicle.	"ectodermal stem cells	453	474	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""ectodermal stem cells"", ""start_span"": 453, ""end_span"": 474, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Given the role of Apc in down - regulation of beta - catenin, loss of Apc would inevitably lead to altered expression of beta - catenin in ectodermal cells during the hair placode formation, giving rise to aberrant follicular growth throughout the embryonic epidermis, including the footpads, where normally hairless ( Figure 5B, 5D, 5F, and 5H).	"ectodermal cells	139	155	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""ectodermal cells"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 155, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
( 2) Another important fact is that in the aforementioned transgenic model the overexpression of transgene is confined to the basal cells of the epidermis and the ORS of hair follicles, where the K14 promoter is active.	"cells of the epidermis	132	154	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells of the epidermis"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The expression of transgene is hence transient and stops once K14 - expressing cells terminally differentiate.	"cells	79	84	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Stabilization of beta - catenin in a broader population of cells could account for some of the phenotypic differences.	"cells	59	64	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
However, we did not detect any elevated beta - catenin expression in either K1 - or K6 - positive differentiated cells in postnatal mutant skin.	"cells	113	118	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

K14 - driven loss of Apc and subsequent constitutive expression of beta - catenin in TECs have therefore misdirected them to wrong epithelial cell fate, not allowing proper differentiation to either cortical or medullary TECs, which is essential for normal thymocyte development.	"epithelial cell	131	146	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""epithelial cell"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In conclusion, we have shown that loss of Apc in K14 - expressing embryonic cells causes aberrant morphogenesis in various skin appendages, including hair follicles and teeth, and abnormal thymus organogensis.

In both models in - frame deletion within Itpr1 leads to a decrease in the normally high level of Itpr1 expression in cerebellar Purkinje cells.	"Purkinje cells	129	143	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Purkinje cells"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We show here that this mutation results in a dramatic reduction in ITPR1 in cells from these patients.	"cells	76	81	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
As with the Itpr1opt / opt mice, where the deletion of exons 43 and 44 is also predicted to leave the translational reading frame unaffected, the in - frame Itpr1 Delta 18 / Delta 18 deletion mutation results in markedly decreased levels of Itpr1 in cerebellar Purkinje cells.

Conversely, mutation of ITPR1 is biologically plausible as a cause of ataxia: the protein is highly expressed in Purkinje cells; as we have shown here, mice with mutation at this locus present with ataxia; and perturbed Ca2 + signaling has previously been implicated in the etiology of ataxia, notably in episodic ataxia type 2 and SCA6 [ 8].	"Purkinje cells	113	127	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Purkinje cells"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In further support of this conclusion, analysis of protein levels of ITPR1 in Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV) immortalized lymphocytes from affected and unaffected AUS1 family members revealed that all affected members showed a dramatic decrease in ITPR1 levels when compared with the family member without the deletion ( Figure 4).

Second, we cannot rule out the existence of an alternate start site for ITPR1 that may result in a product that confers a pathogenic gain of function to the protein; however, Western blot analysis of cells derived from affected AUS1 family members, which was performed using an antibody raised against the C - terminal portion of ITPR1, failed to identify any disease - specific truncated protein products.
