Altogether, our data demonstrate that loss of p150CAF - 1 function in ES cells and early embryos alters first the organization of heterochromatin in the nucleus and, in a subsequent step, cell cycle and viability.	cells,73,78,Cell	cell,188,192,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 188, ""end_span"": 192, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
To rule out the possibility that hypomethylation of pericentric repeats might contribute to the destabilization of heterochromatin domains in p150CAF - 1 - depleted ES cells, we tested our RNAi plasmid vector in a XY ES cell line, and confirmed that loss of p150CAF - 1 leads to disruption of heterochromatin organization independently of the degree of DNA methylation at pericentric repeats ( unpublished data).	cells,168,173,Cell	cell,220,224,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 168, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 220, ""end_span"": 224, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test

It was suggested that Rb might regulate photoreceptor differentiation, possibly through rod - specific transcription factors ( Figure 1B) [ 29].	photoreceptor,40,53,Cell	rod,88,91,Cell	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
However, if Rb does regulate photoreceptor differentiation, it does so by inhibiting E2f1, not by potentiating rod differentiation factors, such as Otx2, Crx, or Nrl.	photoreceptor,29,42,Cell	rod,111,114,Cell	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
This modest reduction of RPC numbers in the absence of E2f1 accounts for the slight reduction in the number of ganglion cells at P0, in the number of bipolar cells at P18 or P30, and in the thickness of the ONL at P18 or P30 in the E2f1 KO and Rb / E2f1 DKO retina ( Figure 2B - 2D).	ganglion cells,111,125,Cell	bipolar cells,150,163,Cell	"[{""token"": ""ganglion cells"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""bipolar cells"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 163, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
Despite a slight drop in absolute cell numbers, the proportion of Rb / E2f1 DKO and E2f1 KO bipolar cells was the same as WT ( data not shown).	cell,34,38,Cell	bipolar cells,92,105,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""bipolar cells"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
Typically, an ERG signal begins with a negative deflection initiated by the photoreceptors ( the a - wave), which is terminated by a large positive deflection due to the activation of ON bipolar cells ( the b - wave).	photoreceptors,76,90,Cell	ON bipolar cells,184,200,Cell	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptors"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""ON bipolar cells"", ""start_span"": 184, ""end_span"": 200, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
The photopic response, a product of cone and mainly bipolar activity, was much reduced by Rb loss, but was rescued considerably in the Rb / E2f1 DKO retina ( Figure S5).	cone,36,40,Cell	bipolar,52,59,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""bipolar"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
The photopic response in E2f1 KO mice was slightly reduced relative to WT ( Figure S5B), possibly because E2f1 is required for maximal expansion of embryonic RPCs, and the E2f1 KO retina has, as noted earlier, slightly fewer cells than the WT retina, although cell type proportions are unaffected ( D. C. and R. B., unpublished data).	cells,225,230,Cell	cell,260,264,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 225, ""end_span"": 230, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 260, ""end_span"": 264, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
"Thus, marginally subnormal photopic responses in the Rb / E2f1 DKO retina can be attributed to both a reduction of cone numbers in E2f1 KO mice alone, and a "" genuine "" slight reduction in cone function attributable to Rb loss relative to WT."	cone,115,119,Cell	cone,189,193,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 189, ""end_span"": 193, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
Thus, E2f1 deletion not only rescues morphology but also both rod and cone system function in the Rb KO retina.	rod,62,65,Cell	cone,70,74,Cell	"[{""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
Camk2a marks both SACs and ganglion cells [ 37], but because ganglion cells are eliminated in the Rb KO retina, Camk2a is a specific SAC marker in this context.	ganglion cells,27,41,Cell	ganglion cells,61,75,Cell	"[{""token"": ""ganglion cells"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""ganglion cells"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
The latter fraction is higher than WT because ganglion cells, which normally make up ~ 40% of Camk2a + cells, are killed by apoptosis.	ganglion cells,46,60,Cell	cells,103,108,Cell	"[{""token"": ""ganglion cells"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
This marker is expressed in both SACs and ganglion cells, thus Isl1 + cells in the INL are exclusively SACs [ 49].	ganglion cells,42,56,Cell	cells,70,75,Cell	"[{""token"": ""ganglion cells"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
At P0, no WT Isl1 + cells in the inner neuroblastic layer ( NBL) ( which is the future INL) were dividing, but 57 +/- 14 Isl1 + / Mki67 + cells were detected in the Rb KO inner NBL ( Figure 4D).	cells,20,25,Cell	cells,138,143,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
As the retina differentiated and RPC division diminished, the number of E2f3 + cells also dropped, and by P8, when division is virtually over, only a subset of post - mitotic cells in the inner retina expressed E2f3 ( Figure 5A).	cells,79,84,Cell	cells,175,180,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 180, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
Rb protein was also detected in the inner retina ( Figure 5A), and showed a similar distribution as E2f3 in SACs ( Figure 5B), and was also present in mature ganglion cells and M u ller cells as reported [ 51].	ganglion cells,158,172,Cell	M u ller cells,177,191,Cell	"[{""token"": ""ganglion cells"", ""start_span"": 158, ""end_span"": 172, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""M u ller cells"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 191, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
In agreement, we could not detect defects in cholinergic Rb KO neurons in the developing forebrain, but other Rb KO neurons in this region showed differentiation defects that were rescued by deleting E2f3 [ 53].	cholinergic Rb KO neurons,45,70,Cell	neurons,116,123,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cholinergic Rb KO neurons"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
Thus, separate from its role in cell cycle control, Rb regulation of E2f3a is critical to ensure proper neuronal differentiation.	cell,32,36,Cell	neuronal,104,112,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
Work in the early 1990s showed that Rb loss triggers defects in neuronal cell cycle exit, survival, and differentiation [ 26 - 28].	neuronal,64,72,Cell	cell,73,77,Cell	"[{""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
In any case, it is clear that in most retinal cells, including photoreceptors [ 29], transcription factors that promote differentiation function independently of Rb.	cells,46,51,Cell	photoreceptors,63,77,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""photoreceptors"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
These data are consistent with the observation that E2f1 overexpression in newborn photoreceptors drives ectopic division and apoptosis [ 60], and add to the growing evidence indicating that E2f1 is the major, and perhaps only, member of the three activating E2fs required to induce apoptosis in Rb KO cells [ 10, 15].	photoreceptors,83,97,Cell	cells,302,307,Cell	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptors"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 302, ""end_span"": 307, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
Early overexpression studies in vitro suggested Rb might temper expansion of cycling cells, but KO studies in vivo indicate that its major role is to block division in terminally differentiating cells.	cells,85,90,Cell	cells,195,200,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 195, ""end_span"": 200, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
In brain, Rb KO neurons migrate away from the ventricular zone and switch on Tubb3 ( beta III - tubulin), but continue to incorporate BrdU [ 13], and in gut epithelia, differentiated enterocytes migrate up the villi and activate expression of serotonin, yet continue to incorporate BrdU [ 67].	neurons,16,23,Cell	enterocytes,183,194,Cell	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""enterocytes"", ""start_span"": 183, ""end_span"": 194, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
It may be difficult to identify E2f3a - specific target genes or cytoplasmic proteins in SACs since these neurons are a small proportion ( < 1%) of the total retina and only ~ 5. 2% of amacrine neurons [ 38].	neurons,106,113,Cell	amacrine neurons,185,201,Cell	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""amacrine neurons"", ""start_span"": 185, ""end_span"": 201, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
