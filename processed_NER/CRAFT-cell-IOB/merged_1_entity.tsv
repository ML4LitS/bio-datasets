In essence, this theory of regulation of neuronal connections via neurotrophic support implies that only limited quantities of neurotrophins are released by the target tissue to support only properly connected sensory neurons by providing only these with a critical amount of neurotrophins [ 21].	sensory neurons,210,225,Cell	"[{""token"": ""sensory neurons"", ""start_span"": 210, ""end_span"": 225, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	train

In contrast, Brn3c is barely expressed during embryogenesis in the CNS [ 22] thus arguing that the survival of ear primary neurons depends crucially on the periphery.	primary neurons,115,130,Cell	"[{""token"": ""primary neurons"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	train

The comparatively high level of NT - 3 expression in Brn3c null mutant cochlea, which has been shown to be the neurotrophin most prominently supporting spiral sensory neurons [ 6, 9, 14], is in agreement with the normal development of cochlear innervation in newborn Brn3c null mutants.	sensory neurons,159,174,Cell	"[{""token"": ""sensory neurons"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	train
In fact, in the cochlea of embryos and neonates as well as in the saccule and utricle of embryos, NT - 3 is predominantly expressed in supporting cells [ 6].	supporting cells,135,151,Cell	"[{""token"": ""supporting cells"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	train
Past work has shown that BDNF and NT - 3 appear to shift in their expression into inner hair cells around birth or are lost in the ear and other parts of the nervous system [ 6, 10, 20, 23].	inner hair cells,82,98,Cell	"[{""token"": ""inner hair cells"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	train

The rapid kinetics of Snail expression were reflected at the mRNA level, suggesting that Snail promoter activity in keratinocytes might be sensitive to TGF - beta 2 signaling ( Figure 5C).	keratinocytes,116,129,Cell	"[{""token"": ""keratinocytes"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	train
At 2 d after transient transfection, keratinocytes were treated with TGF - beta 2 ( t = 0) and then assayed for transgene activity over the same time course in which we had observed Snail protein induction.	keratinocytes,37,50,Cell	"[{""token"": ""keratinocytes"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	train

Taken together, these results suggested that in keratinocytes, TGF - beta 2 signaling results in a pSMAD2 - dependent transient activation of the Snail gene, and that maintenance of Snail protein relies, in part, upon sustained promoter activity.	keratinocytes,48,61,Cell	"[{""token"": ""keratinocytes"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	train

Consistent with this notion, basement membrane remodeling still took place in the TGF - beta 2 - null buds, as judged by immunofluorescence with antibodies against beta 4 integrin, an integral component of keratinocyte - mediated adhesion to its underlying basement membrane ( Figure 6F).	keratinocyte,206,218,Cell	"[{""token"": ""keratinocyte"", ""start_span"": 206, ""end_span"": 218, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	train

Our finding that TGF - beta 2 is upstream from Ki67 expression and MAPK activation lends further support to the notion that hair follicle keratinocytes at this early stage of development react to TGF - beta 2 signaling in a fashion opposite to that typically expected for TGF - beta factors.	keratinocytes,138,151,Cell	"[{""token"": ""keratinocytes"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	train
One obvious factor is the K14 promoter, which is elevated in the basal layer of the epidermis and the outer root sheath ( ORS) of the hair follicle, but is markedly down - regulated in developing embryonic hair buds as well as in the postnatal hair progenitor cells.	cells,260,265,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 260, ""end_span"": 265, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	train

In the course of these studies, we also noted that Snail can also contribute to this process in keratinocytes in vitro, and our present studies revealed that Snail is expressed at the right place and time to be physiologically relevant in the process.	keratinocytes,96,109,Cell	"[{""token"": ""keratinocytes"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	train
The marked epidermal hyperproliferation seen in the K14 - Snail Tg skin, coupled with the converse suppression of proliferation and Snail in TGF - beta 2 - null hair buds led us to wonder whether the down - regulation of E - cadherin during follicle morphogenesis might have a direct impact on elevating the proliferative state of these cells.	cells,337,342,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 337, ""end_span"": 342, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	train

In keeping with this observation is the fact that some electroretinogram activity is present in peripherin - / - mice, suggesting that minimal phototransduction is present in these mice, enough to drive activity at the photoreceptor synapse.	photoreceptor,219,232,Cell	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 219, ""end_span"": 232, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	train
In vitro studies wherein synapse elements are formed in the absence of proper outer segment development and, therefore, possible absence of light - dependent photoreceptor activity, have indicated the independence of phototransduction and synapse formation, at least for the initial stages [ 50, 51].	photoreceptor,158,171,Cell	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 158, ""end_span"": 171, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	train

Recent evidence points toward a transcriptional coactivator, peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - gamma ( PPAR gamma) coactivator - 1 alpha ( PGC - 1 alpha), as an integrator of the molecular regulatory circuitry involved in the transcriptional control of cellular energy metabolism, including mitochondrial function and biogenesis [ 1, 2].	cellular,266,274,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cellular"", ""start_span"": 266, ""end_span"": 274, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	train

Expression of Er81 in DRG neurons of embryos containing integration of EWS - Pea3 in the Er81 locus ( Er81EWS - Pea3 / -) was abolished ( Figure 1E), and the expression level of the calcium - binding protein Parvalbumin ( PV) in proprioceptive afferents, which is decreased approximately 5 - to 10 - fold in Er81 mutants [ 14], was comparable to wild - type levels in Er81EWS - Pea3 / - embryos ( Figure 1F - 1H).	neurons,26,33,Cell	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	train

In summary, whereas isochronic expression of EWS - Pea3 promoted the establishment of proprioceptive afferent projections into the ventral spinal cord, precocious expression of the same ETS signaling factor in DRG neurons interfered with establishment of projections into the spinal cord as well as to peripheral targets.	neurons,214,221,Cell	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 214, ""end_span"": 221, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	train

We cultured E13. 5 whole DRG explants from wild - type and TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos in the presence of NGF or NT - 3 or in the absence of neurotrophins and analyzed neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth on matrigel substrate after 48 h in vitro.	neuronal,178,186,Cell	"[{""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 178, ""end_span"": 186, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	train

To directly compare neurotrophin dependence of DRG neurons expressing EWS - Pea3 from the Tau locus at a precocious versus isochronic time of onset, we generated a strain of mice in which Cre recombinase is expressed from the PV locus ( Figure S4).	neurons,51,58,Cell	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	train

To begin to assess at which step of the neurotrophin signaling cascade DRG neurons from TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos become unresponsive to the addition of neurotrophins, we assayed the expression of neurotrophin receptors in TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos ( Figure 6).	neurons,75,82,Cell	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	train
Whereas expression of the neurotrophin receptors TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC marks afferents of distinct sensory modalities in DRG of wild - type embryos ( Figure 6A - 6C) [ 4, 29], TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos showed complete absence of expression of TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC in DRG neurons at E16. 5 ( Figure 6G - 6I).	neurons,282,289,Cell	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 282, ""end_span"": 289, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	train

Moreover, PV was not expressed in DRG neurons of TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos ( Figure S5) but was expressed by proprioceptive afferents in both wild - type and Er81EWS - Pea3 / - embryos ( see Figures 1 and S5) [ 14].	neurons,38,45,Cell	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	train

Induction of Er81 expression in proprioceptive afferents is controlled by peripheral NT - 3 as axons reach the vicinity of target muscles, and thus occurs only approximately 3 d after proprioceptive neurons become post - mitotic [ 9, 14].	neurons,199,206,Cell	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 199, ""end_span"": 206, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	train

The fusion of EWS with Pea3 could circumvent a need for activation through specific cofactors while still maintaining ETS site dependence, thus rendering EWS - Pea3 less sensitive to the cellular context than endogenous ETS transcription factors.	cellular,187,195,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cellular"", ""start_span"": 187, ""end_span"": 195, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	train

In contrast, in Alk2 / Wnt1 - Cre mutants a sizeable septal mesenchyme could be seen, still without any obvious looping of the aortic sac and truncal OFT, suggesting that the mere presence of the septal mesenchyme, without correct smooth muscle cell differentiation, is not sufficient for OFT rotation.	smooth muscle cell,231,249,Cell	"[{""token"": ""smooth muscle cell"", ""start_span"": 231, ""end_span"": 249, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	train

However, because different members of this group often have similar effects on target cells and are produced in overlapping regions of the embryo and hence can be redundant with one another, removal of any single member of the BMP family may not reveal the full extent of the roles they play during development.	cells,86,91,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	train

Given the role of Apc in down - regulation of beta - catenin, loss of Apc would inevitably lead to altered expression of beta - catenin in ectodermal cells during the hair placode formation, giving rise to aberrant follicular growth throughout the embryonic epidermis, including the footpads, where normally hairless ( Figure 5B, 5D, 5F, and 5H).	ectodermal cells,139,155,Cell	"[{""token"": ""ectodermal cells"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 155, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	valid

While in the formation and storage of olfactory memory piriform cortex [ 5 - 7], hippocampus [ 8, 9], and olfactory bulb [ 10 - 12] are all implicated, the cellular correlates for these processes have not been clearly delineated.	cellular,156,164,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cellular"", ""start_span"": 156, ""end_span"": 164, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
Concerning odor discrimination itself, cellular mechanisms for this process are often attributed to the inhibitory circuitry of the olfactory bulb ( [ 24 - 30]; reviewed in [ 31 - 33]).	cellular,39,47,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cellular"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
Given that neuronal circuits underlying odor discrimination, as well as olfactory memory, rely on properties of fast excitatory neurotransmission mediated by alpha - amino - 3 - hydroxy - 5 - methyl - 4 - isoxazolepropionate receptors ( AMPARs), we sought to alter, by genetic means, the specific functional contribution of alpha - amino - 3 - hydroxy - 5 - methyl - 4 - isoxazolepropionate ( AMPA) channels containing the dominant subunit GluR - B.	neuronal,11,19,Cell	"[{""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
Notably, the normally low Ca2 + permeability of AMPA channels in principal neurons is solely mediated by GluR - B, due to a unique arginine residue ( R587) in the functionally critical glutamine / arginine ( Q / R) site of the pore - forming segment M2 [ 44, 47, 48], resulting from RNA editing of GluR - B pre - mRNA ( [ 49]; reviewed in [ 50]).	principal neurons,65,82,Cell	"[{""token"": ""principal neurons"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
Thus, the absence of GluR - B, or the expression of GluR - B ( Q) in the olfactory bulb, may generate increased inhibition in mitral cells.	cells,133,138,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
Moreover, the ablation of GluR - B, but also changes in the extent of Q / R site editing of GluR - B, can alter the strength of excitatory synaptic transmission in the genetically addressed neuronal populations [ 51, 58, 60], thus potentially shifting the balance of excitatory and inhibitory transmission in the affected circuits.	neuronal,190,198,Cell	"[{""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 190, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test

This is further supported by kainate - induced Co2 + uptake in acute brain slices, revealing considerably higher Co2 + uptake via Ca2 + - permeable AMPARs in hippocampal pyramidal neurons of mice expressing GluR - B ( Q), than those lacking GluR - B ( DRS, RS, and PHS, unpublished data).	pyramidal neurons,170,187,Cell	"[{""token"": ""pyramidal neurons"", ""start_span"": 170, ""end_span"": 187, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test

As Ca2 + influx through glutamate receptors is thought to contribute to lateral and recurrent inhibition ( [ 38] see also [ 39]), the absence of GluR - B, or the presence of GluR - B ( Q) in the olfactory bulb, is likely to result in increased inhibition between the principal neurons in this structure.	principal neurons,267,284,Cell	"[{""token"": ""principal neurons"", ""start_span"": 267, ""end_span"": 284, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test

Despite overexpression of mRNA from the XpdTTD allele relative to the wt allele ( Figure 1E), TFIIH protein levels were reduced by 50% in primary mouse XpdTTD / TTD fibroblasts ( Figure 4E and 4F), thereby mimicking the situation in human patients with TTD.	fibroblasts,165,176,Cell	"[{""token"": ""fibroblasts"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test

Thus, the improved UV survival observed in compound heterozygote cells ( Figure 4A) and likely the rescue of TTD progeroid symptoms ( Figure 3) were not due to normalisation of TFIIH levels, suggesting a qualitative rather than a quantitative effect on these phenotypes in vivo.	cells,65,70,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test

TTD - specific cutaneous and anaemic features, on the other hand, are thought to result from a specific kind of transcriptional insufficiency caused by depletion of unstable TFIIH during the terminal differentiation of skin, hair - shaft, and blood cells [ 16, 24].	blood cells,243,254,Cell	"[{""token"": ""blood cells"", ""start_span"": 243, ""end_span"": 254, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
During early embryonic development, XpdTTD is dominant over the Xpd + XPCS and Xpd + XP alleles, whereas later in the ontogenesis of skin, hair - shaft, and blood cells, the situation is reversed.	blood cells,157,168,Cell	"[{""token"": ""blood cells"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 168, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test

However, based on the ability of cell extracts that are defective in two different TFIIH components ( XPD and XPB) to complement NER activity in vitro [ 26], it is likely that TFIIH ( or its components) can either multimerise or exchange at least during the NER reaction.	cell,33,37,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test

p150CAF - 1 depletion in MEFs resulted in a strong inhibition of cell proliferation ( unpublished data), but did not alter the clustering of heterochromatin domains ( Figures 2C and S2).	cell,65,69,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test

We also wondered whether loss of p150CAF - 1 in ES cells specifically affects the heterochromatin nuclear subcompartment, or whether it might result in a more global loss of nuclear organization and architecture.	cells,51,56,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test

Thus, CAF - 1 is specifically required in early embryos and in ES cells for the proper organization of the heterochromatin subnuclear compartment.	cells,66,71,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test

We show here that 3 d after transfection of the RNAi vector, p150CAF - 1 - depleted cells ( identified by a complete absence of CAF - 1 IF signal) appear still active for replication, as revealed by incorporation of the thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine ( BrdU) ( Figure 3A), the PCNA ( proliferating cell nuclear antigen) pattern ( Figure 3B), and flow cytometry analysis ( Figure 3C).	cells,84,89,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test

Quantification of fluorescence along a line randomly drawn across the nucleus revealed lower fluorescence intensity and a broader distribution of DAPI and major satellite hybridization signals in p150CAF - 1 - depleted cells ( Figure 4C and 4D), indicating decondensation of pericentric heterochromatin domains.	cells,219,224,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 219, ""end_span"": 224, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test

The H3K9me3 mark [ 32] was also significantly reduced in p150CAF - 1 - depleted cells, though to a lesser extent than H4K20me3 ( Figure 7A and 7B).	cells,80,85,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
In wild - type cells, most of H4K20me3 and H3K9me3 signals are present at the level of DAPI - dense domains when visualized by IF [ 29] ( Figures 7C and 7D).	cells,15,20,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test

The H4K20me3 pattern was even more severely altered, showing both a loss of the typical dots revealed in control cells and a reduction in signal intensity ( Figure 7D).	cells,113,118,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
Altogether, our results show that depletion of CAF - 1 in ES cells leads to a simultaneous disruption of heterochromatin 3 - D organization and an alteration in epigenetic marking.	cells,61,66,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test

Thus, deregulated E2f1 activity in the retina, whether resulting from the inactivation of Rb or from overexpression, promotes unscheduled cell division and triggers apoptosis in susceptible RTCs.	cell,138,142,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
Comprehensive marker analysis revealed that, in striking contrast to other retinal neurons, E2f1 deletion did not suppress defects in Rb KO cholinergic SACs.	neurons,83,90,Cell	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
These data expand insight into the development of these important interneurons, but more critically, provide to our knowledge the first unambiguous evidence that Rb regulates neurogenesis beyond terminal mitosis.	interneurons,66,78,Cell	"[{""token"": ""interneurons"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
There is no direct evidence that Rb is required for terminal differentiation of other cell types.	cell,86,90,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
Moreover, deleting E2f1, but not E2f3, reversed deregulated expression of cell cycle and apoptotic genes in the Rb KO retina.	cell,74,78,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
Thus, E2f3 inhibition is the first, and may be the only, mechanism by which Rb participates directly in neuronal differentiation.	neuronal,104,112,Cell	"[{""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
E2f3b was the primary candidate, since Rb and E2f3b collaborate to repress targets in quiescent cells in vitro [ 19].	cells,96,101,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
E2f3a and E2f3b share 110 C - terminal amino acids that encode the NLS, DNA - binding, marked box, transactivation, and Rb - binding domains [ 16], yet they exhibit different subcellular distribution in developing retinal cells.	cells,222,227,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 222, ""end_span"": 227, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
Rb family and Tfdp proteins can also determine E2f localization [ 20 - 22], and we found that a portion of both Rb and Tfdp1 proteins are cytoplasmic in retinal cells.	cells,161,166,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 161, ""end_span"": 166, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
In the retina, differentiating transition cells are born in the absence of Rb, migrate to the correct layer, and express appropriate markers ( [ 2] and this work).	cells,42,47,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
In the case of SACs, the differentiation defects we observed ( e. g., loss of Slc18a3 and Chat) were not due to aberrant division, but it is possible there are other problems with these cells that are caused by ectopic division.	cells,186,191,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 186, ""end_span"": 191, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
Nevertheless, it is clear that many aspects of differentiation in multiple cell types are compatible with ectopic division.	cell,75,79,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
However, division of terminally differentiating cells is dangerous, since it may facilitate transformation, as is the case in retinoblastoma ( reviewed in [ 66]).	cells,48,53,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
Both scenarios are feasible since E2fs regulate differentiation genes [ 44 - 48], and cell cycle regulators, such as Cdkn1b, have cytoplasmic activities that influence differentiation [ 68, 69].	cell,86,90,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
However, these studies did not assess whether these cell types differentiate normally if Rb is deleted along with one or more E2f family members.	cell,52,56,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
Our study is the first to our knowledge to assess comprehensively whether Rb KO cells can differentiate in the absence of different E2fs.	cells,80,85,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	test
