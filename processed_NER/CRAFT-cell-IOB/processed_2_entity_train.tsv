While the experimental design of these experiments was somewhat different from that of Moyna - han et al [ 24], the results raise the possibility that CAPAN - 1 cells have more than one mutation that lowers the efficiency of recombinational repair relative to that observed in other human cell lines.

This partial development of hair cells could lead to enough neurotrophin expression to sustain sensory neurons through embryonic development.

Despite more severe loss of hair cells ( 1% compared to 20%), the cochlea retains many more sensory neurons ( 46% compared to 15%) than vestibular epithelia.

Close examination has revealed that some ' immature ' hair cells form in Brn3c null mutants and express cellular markers such as Myosin VI and VIIa, calretinin and parvalbumin [ 3].	"hair cells	54	64	Cell"	"cellular	104	112	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""hair cells"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cellular"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Consistent with an apparent absence of mature hair cells, initial work suggested that all vestibular and most spiral ganglion cells are lost by postnatal day 14 ( P14; [ 1]).

However, more detailed quantification by others [ 3] reported that at P4 about 77% of vestibular neurons and only 29% of spiral neurons are lost.	"neurons	97	104	Cell"	"neurons	128	135	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Moreover, recent work shows that in embryos NT - 3 is primarily expressed in supporting cells, moving only around birth into hair cells [ 6, 7].	"supporting cells	77	93	Cell"	"hair cells	125	135	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""supporting cells"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""hair cells"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In fact, the selective loss of vestibular as compared to cochlear sensory neurons ( 77% versus 29%; [ 3]) suggests that NT - 3 expression may be less downregulated in Brn3c null mutants than BDNF [ 6, 8, 9], provided that at least some differentiation of supporting cells takes place.

We want to evaluate a possible correlation between the topology of sensory neuron loss and absence of a specific neurotrophin or topological loss of hair cells at birth and in older animals.

This retention of afferents and efferents is unrelated to hair cell differentiation as not even immature hair cells can be detected at early postnatal stages with MyoVII immunocytochemistry in this part of the cochlea.

These data suggest a loss of 80 - 85% of vestibular sensory neurons in BDNF and trkB null mutants [ 13] and of 77% of vestibular sensory neurons in P4 Brn3c null mutants [ 3].

The apex shows little change, except for the absence of fibers to the area of outer hair cells and the formation of inner spiral bundles passing along the few immature hair cells ( d, f, g).

In contrast, more immature hair cells are found in the appropriate position of hair cells in the vestibular endorgans ( Table 1).

Note the uniform staining with this antibody of all three rows of outer hair cells ( OHC) and the single row of inner hair cells ( IHC) in the wildtype ( a, c).

In contrast, only few immature hair cells ( iHC) are found in the basal turn of the mutant littermate ( b) and only an occasional cell is MyoVII immunopositive in the middle turn ( d).

Comparison of numbers of immature hair cells in the vestibular and cochlear areas ( Fig. 4) with the numbers of surviving vestibular and cochlear sensory neurons does not show any correlation ( Table 1; Fig. 5).

And yet only about 50% of cochlear sensory neurons are lost overall with a less severe loss in the apex in which we could not detect any immature hair cells with MyoVIIa immunocytochemistry.

Note the sharp reduction to 1% in the cochlear immature hair cells ( bottom) whereas spiral sensory neurons ( SG) are only reduced by 50% ( top).

In contrast, 20% immature hair cells could be identified in vestibular sensory epithelia ( saccule has been selected; bottom) whereas only around 15% of the vestibular sensory neurons survive to this age ( VG; top).

Note the prominent BDNF expression in the hair cell region ( HaC) of control canal ( b) and saccule ( d) and low levels of expression in the Brn3c null mice ( a, c) over immature hair cells ( iHC).

A strong BDNF signal was found over the hair cells of control animals and an occasional immature hair cell also showed a BDNF signal in the Brn3c null mutants.

Since BDNF appears to be exclusively produced by hair cells [ 6, 7, 20], the lack of terminal differentiation of hair cells appears to be accompanied by only limited expression of BDNF, as is the case in the canal cristae ( Fig. 8).

This expression of NT - 3 in supporting cells in embryos and neonates may even preserve in Brn3c null mutants the numerous spiral sensory neurons in the apex of 8 - day old animals ( Figs. 3, 4).

However, the apex of Brn3c null mutants, which retains most of the spiral neuron afferents at 6 - month, shows no formation of mature hair cells at any time surveyed here ( P0, P8, P10).

Formation of radial fibers that bring peripheral processes of spiral neurons to the organ of Corti seems to be rather normal, even in the apex of the cochlea which does not even develop immature hair cells recognizable by Myo VIIa.

It is measured as a sodium chloride concentration in which cellular lysis starts ( minimal resistance) up to a complete lysis ( maximal resistance) of a red blood cell.

In vitro the activated cells form aggregates recruiting additional cells in the solution thereby reducing its cloudiness.

Analysis of the transmission values of aggregation curves after platelet activation by ristocetin addition ( von Willebrand cofactor) showed that both curves differed significantly at the time point of seven seconds after platelet initiation ( p = 0. 0287, n knock out = 16, n wild type = 15; Fig. 6).

Furthermore we found that murine platelets responded immediately to the initiating chemical whereas human platelets have a lag phase [ 23].

Platelet aggregation curves from platelet rich plasma of annexin A7 knock out and wild type mice.

Murine platelets react immediately to the initiating chemical and show no lag phase like the normal human platelets.

For comparison of the range of the platelet impairment slightly affected human platelets are shown as well ( von Willebrand syndrome).

We showed the presence of the 51 kDa isoform as well, adding red blood cells to the list of cells that harbor this isoform.	"red blood cells	61	76	Cell"	"cells	92	97	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""red blood cells"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
[ 7] not only demonstrated the presence of annexin A7 in red blood cells, they also showed that annexin A7 and sorcin were enriched in membrane raft domains of nanovesicles formed from red blood cells in vitro.	"red blood cells	57	72	Cell"	"red blood cells	185	200	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""red blood cells"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""red blood cells"", ""start_span"": 185, ""end_span"": 200, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Interestingly, in vesicles of red blood cells lacking annexin A7 the amount of sorcin is lowered, indicating that its localisation is affected by the loss of annexin A7 or its expression during red blood cell development was reduced.	"red blood cells	30	45	Cell"	"red blood cell	194	208	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""red blood cells"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""red blood cell"", ""start_span"": 194, ""end_span"": 208, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In the platelet aggregation experiments the initial aggregation velocity was slightly, but significantly lower in platelets lacking annexin A7.

Only in situations with severe physical injury, distinct environmental influences or additional platelet attributes like the platelet antigen polymorphism [ 53] differences might become apparent.	"platelet	96	104	Cell"	"platelet	125	133	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""platelet"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""platelet"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
250 mu l adjusted platelets were prewarmed to 37 degrees C and used in the assay, and the aggregation process was started by adding 25 mu l of a prewarmed 16. 5 mg / ml ristocetin solution ( DiaMed Diagnostica, Bensheim, FRG; concentration in the assay: 1. 5 mg / ml), a reagent which worked reliably in our hands with mouse and human platelets.

For standard haematopoetic measurements and cell counts on murine and human blood samples about 300 mu l of blood were analysed with an ADVIA 120 electronic cell counter ( Bayer).	"cell	44	48	Cell"	"cell	157	161	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
"With this equipment red blood cells and platelets are "" transformed "" into spherical bodies without changing their volume."	"red blood cells	20	35	Cell"	"platelets	40	49	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""red blood cells"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""platelets"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Therefore number and volume of red blood cells and platelets are not calculated values, but directly measured values.	"red blood cells	31	46	Cell"	"platelets	51	60	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""red blood cells"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""platelets"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Differences for one gene pair are apparently due to both unequal numbers of expressing cells and unequal transcript levels per expressing cell.	"cells	87	92	Cell"	"cell	138	142	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We note that hybridization intensities per positive neuron appear stronger for gene A than gene D after comparable exposure times, in accordance with the idea that transcript levels are higher per cell.	"neuron	52	58	Cell"	"cell	197	201	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neuron"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 197, ""end_span"": 201, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Thus, we suggest that expression in more cells and in higher levels per cell together account for the almost 300 - fold higher olfactory epithelial RNA levels of gene A relative to gene D ( Figure 3).	"cells	41	46	Cell"	"cell	72	76	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Higher expression levels could be due to increased transcript number per cell and / or a greater number of olfactory neurons ' choosing ' those genes.	"cell	73	77	Cell"	"olfactory neurons	107	124	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""olfactory neurons"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
It would be interesting to collect data for additional genes to determine how the numbers of expressing cells and transcript levels per cell vary across the olfactory receptor family.	"cells	104	109	Cell"	"cell	136	140	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Data from a number of previous studies also show that different olfactory receptor genes, or even copies of the same olfactory receptor transgene in different genomic locations are expressed in different numbers of cells [ 14, 18, 35], but do not address the issue of transcript level per cell.	"cells	215	220	Cell"	"cell	289	293	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 215, ""end_span"": 220, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 289, ""end_span"": 293, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The fact that some genes are chosen more frequently, and when chosen may be expressed at higher levels per cell, is intriguing given each olfactory neuron ' s single - allele expression regime.	"cell	107	111	Cell"	"olfactory neuron	138	154	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""olfactory neuron"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Alternatively, the unusual transcriptional regulation of olfactory receptors might ensure that only one splice isoform is expressed per cell ( unlikely, but possible if an RNA - based feedback mechanism operates), thus condemning cells expressing these aberrant isoforms to be dysfunctional.	"cell	136	140	Cell"	"cells	230	235	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 230, ""end_span"": 235, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Wang, Axel and coworkers have shown that an artificial transgenic olfactory receptor gene containing two nonsense mutations can support development of an olfactory neuron, but that pseudogene - expressing neurons fail to converge on a glomerulus in the olfactory bulb [ 45].	"olfactory neuron	154	170	Cell"	"neurons	205	212	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""olfactory neuron"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 170, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 205, ""end_span"": 212, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Different expression levels of one pair of olfactory receptors is due to different numbers of expressing cells and different transcript levels per cell.	"cells	105	110	Cell"	"cell	147	151	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
6B are signals of 10 mu g extracts of HEK293 cell lysates, 100 mu g extracts of 3T3 and PC12 cell lysates.

Thus, the expression levels of Acdp1 in these cell types vary a lot, with the highest expression in HEK293 cells.

The discrepancy for Acdp localization in neuronal cells could be caused by non - specificity for previous antibody which was produced by the recombinant ACD domain, or different cells used.

Co - transfection of COS - 1 cells with both Abcg5 and Abcg8 cDNAs did not alter the pattern of immunofluorescence, although we are not able to confirm simultaneous expression of Abcg8 in cells expressing Abcg5 / sterolin - 1, as we have no suitable antibody for Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 ( Figure 6d).

Strong expression of pendrin was observed not only in outer sulcus epithelial cells, as predicted from in situ hybridization data, but also in root cells, in apical membranes of spiral prominence surface epithelial cells and in apical membranes of spindle - shaped cells that are part of stria vascularis ( Fig. 1a, 1b, 1c).

To determine the cause of the loss of the endocochlear potential in Slc26a4 - / - mice, we first determined whether intermediate cells are present in stria vascularis, since a loss of intermediate cells is known to lead to a loss of the endocochlear potential [ 27, 28].

However, when cells were aged at confluency ( 3 + days post - confluency), homozygous CbCln3 Delta ex7 / 8 cellular subunit c levels were elevated beyond normal wild - type levels by immunostaining ( Fig. 4a) and immunoblot analysis ( Fig. 4b).

At the indicated times, cells were either fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS), pH 7. 4, for 20 minutes and processed for autofluorescence / subunit c immunostaining, or cell pellets were collected for total protein extraction.

Using hair bud morphogenesis as a paradigm, we employed mutant mouse models and cultured keratinocytes to dissect the contributions of multiple extracellular cues in orchestrating adhesion dynamics and proliferation to shape the cluster of cells involved.

Thus, extracellular epithelial - mesenchymal crosstalk must be intricately orchestrated to couple the determination of distinct cell fates with the contemporaneous remodeling of the physical and structural properties of the cell.

Once committed, a small cluster of epithelial cells, the placode, instructs a group of underlying mesenchymal cells to condense and form the nascent dermal papilla, which will be a permanent fixture of the hair follicle.

Both activity of Snail and down - regulation of E - cadherin play pivotal roles in epithelial to mesenchymal transitions ( EMTs), typified by the transformation of polarized, adhering epithelial cells into motile mesenchymal cells [ 16, 17].

As judged by Western blot analysis, the antibody did not detect endogenous proteins from cultured keratinocytes, but it did yield a band of the expected size from keratinocytes transiently expressing a hemagglutinin ( HA) - tagged Snail protein ( Figure 1B).

Consistent with the Western blot data, immunohistochemical analysis did not detect Snail in single - layered E13. 5 epidermis ( Figure 1C) nor in the placode, which is the earliest morphological sign of the commitment of multipotent cells of the embryonic ectoderm to a hair cell fate ( Figure 1D).

Immunohistochemistry with antibodies against the active ( phosphorylated) form of MAPK ( pMAPK) marked a subset of the proliferating ( Ki67 - positive) cells, and pMAPK - positive cells were enriched in the hair bud ( Figure 1G).

Activated, pMAPK - positive cells were also prevalent in these areas ( Figure 2F and 2G), as were cells expressing keratin 6, a keratin induced in the suprabasal layers of hyperproliferative skin ( Figure 2H and 2I).

In this respect, the skin epithelium resembled that of the hair bud, where the down - regulation in junction proteins is permissive for cell - cell remodeling without abrogating intercellular adhesion.

Consistent with our in vivo observations, transfected keratinocytes expressing Snail exhibited a substantial increase in pMAPK levels relative to control cells ( Figure 4D).

If the competition between Grb - 2 / Sos and alpha - catenin for Ajuba is functionally relevant to the hyperproliferative state of a keratinocyte, then overexpression of Ajuba would be expected to bypass the competition and promote activation of the Ras - MAPK pathway in WT keratinocytes.	"keratinocyte	133	145	Cell"	"keratinocytes	275	288	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""keratinocyte"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""keratinocytes"", ""start_span"": 275, ""end_span"": 288, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Since Snail is not expressed in cultured skin keratinocytes that secrete active BMPs and FGFs ( see Figure 1B), we focused our attention on Wnt and TGF - beta signaling as more likely candidates for Snail induction in this cell type.	"keratinocytes	46	59	Cell"	"cell	223	227	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""keratinocytes"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 223, ""end_span"": 227, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In keratinocytes, however, TGF - beta 1 inhibits keratinocyte growth and seems to be involved in triggering the destructive phase of the cycling hair follicle [ 32].

Two major challenges in understanding the mechanisms underlying a particular budding process are to order the temporal sequence of external cues involved and then to dissect how the cells of the developing bud translate these signals into the downstream events of cellular remodeling, proliferation, and differentiation.

TGF - beta s are known to promote withdrawal of keratinocytes from the cell cycle [ 41].

In this regard, the positive effects of TGF - beta 2 on proliferation within the hair bud may be more analogous to what has been seen in progression of squamous cell carcinoma to metastatic carcinoma [ 43] rather than that typically observed for keratinocytes [ 44, 45, 46].

Our studies revealed that in skin keratinocytes that either harbor a conditional null mutation in alpha - catenin or that overexpress Snail, Ajuba develops an interaction with Grb - 2 that is otherwise not observed in WT keratinocytes.

In rod photoreceptors, Crx appears to work in concert with Nrl, a leucine zipper protein that is also restricted in its expression in the retina to rod photoreceptors [ 9].

Mutations in Crx have been associated with several human diseases that lead to blindness, including cone - rod dystrophy 2 [ 6, 13, 14], retinitis pigmentosa [ 14], and LCA [ 14 - 16].

In addition to their importance as a locus of disease, photoreceptor cells serve as an excellent model for studies in neuronal differentiation.

Further, these cells exhibit abnormal synaptic morphology, thereby broadening the function of Crx to photoreceptor synaptogenesis.

Crx - / - photoreceptors had inner segments, demonstrating at least limited photoreceptor polarization in the Crx mutant, but the inner segments were extremely short ( Figure 2).	"photoreceptors	10	24	Cell"	"photoreceptor	76	89	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptors"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In A, a displaced cell nucleus ( n) appearing pyknotic and abnormal deposition of matrix ( mx) material of unknown identity were seen, along with large amounts of membranous vesicles ( arrow) which filled the photoreceptor space and appeared to be released from inner segments.

Occasionally, these nuclei appeared pyknotic ( Figure 3A, n); but, more frequently exhibited the heterochromatin pattern typical of photoreceptors ( data not shown), strongly suggesting that they belonged to ectopic photoreceptors.

Finally, the morphology of the malformed Crx - / - photoreceptors was compared to rhodopsin - / - and peripherin - / - photoreceptors.

Photoreceptors from these two mutant mice examined by SEM from the scleral side appeared highly similar to Crx - / - photoreceptors ( compare Figure 4F to Figure 6A and 6B).

In a previous study, we demonstrated that forced expression of a dominant - negative allele of Crx in developing rods blocked formation of both rod spherules in the outer plexiform layer ( OPL) and outer segments [ 7].

Heat shock during the normal time of rhodopsin onset resulted in substantial and long - lasting rescue of photoreceptor structure and transient rescue of photoreceptor physiology.

The peripherin - / - mouse develops a normal complement of photoreceptor terminals which then degenerate as the photoreceptors are lost [ 30].

However, since other genes expressed in photoreceptors were significantly altered in their expression level in the Crx - / - mouse, there are many candidates that could be important for photoreceptor morphogenesis.

Conversely, RP is notable for initial loss of rod function, followed by loss of cone - mediated vision [ 55].

Oleate loading experiments revealed that the PGC - 1 alpha - / - hepatocytes accumulated neutral lipid to a significantly greater extent than the WT cells ( Figure 8A).

3H - palmitate oxidation rates were significantly lower in PGC - 1 alpha - / - hepatocytes compared to PGC - 1 alpha + / + hepatocytes under basal conditions and following exposure to oleate ( Figure 8B).

3H - TAG incorporation was increased nearly 50% in hepatocytes isolated from PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice compared to PGC - 1 alpha + / + controls ( Figure 8D), confirming that TAG synthesis rates are increased in PGC - 1 alpha null hepatocytes, identifying a second potential mechanism contributing to the fasting - induced hepatic steatosis.

Immunolocalization of an astrocytic marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein, failed to show an increase in numbers of astrocytic processes in PGC - 1 alpha - / - mouse cerebral cortex ( unpublished data).

Microvacuolation of the neuropil and neurons of the PGC - 1 alpha - / - basal ganglia ( caudate and putamen) was also noted in association with a patchy increase in the number and intensity of glial fibrillary acidic protein - immunoreactive astrocytic processes ( unpublished data).

We conclude that reduced hepatocyte mitochondrial respiratory capacity, and possibly activation of lipogenic programs, result in hepatocyte triglyceride accumulation in the context of increased hepatic delivery of fatty acids such as occurs with fasting.

Inspection of sections prepared from the brains of PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice revealed patchy areas of microvacuolation in the pyramidal neurons of the cerebral cortex, accompanied by a mild increase in the number of astrocytes in the basal ganglia.

Neuronal cells of all areas in the adult brain present Annexin A7 in the nucleus, whereas glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP) - positive astrocytes exhibit both, a cytoplasmic and nuclear staining.

We have demonstrated a translocation of Annexin A7 to nuclei of cells in early murine brain development and the presence of Annexin A7 in nuclei of neuronal cells in the adult animal.

Expression studies demonstrated the distribution of Annexin A7 in a wide variety of tissues and cells mainly enriched in the cytosol in close association with membranous structures, but it was also described in the nucleus of adrenal chromaffin cells [ 4].

In undifferentiated cells the protein is equally distributed between cytosol and membrane fractions while in differentiated cells it is exclusively present in the membrane fraction [ 7].

On the protein level, ES cells express only the smaller Annexin A7 isoform of 47 kDa ( Fig. 1B, neuro - 2a cells and heart tissue are included for control).

Annexin A7 is expressed in both cell types of the egg cylinder with a strong staining of the endoderm and a weaker staining of the ectoderm.

In general, we observed two characteristic staining patterns for Annexin A7, a prominent nuclear stain in neurons ( determined by lack of GFAP - immunoreactivity, localization, morphology) and a cytoplasmic and nuclear stain in astrocytes ( GFAP - positive) in all areas of the mature murine brain.

A further cell type of the isocortex showed a strong immunoreactivity in both, nucleus and cytosol, and was identified as pyramidal neuron based on morphology and absence of GFAP immunoreactivity.

Annexin A7 is present in neurons and astrocytes of the cortex temporalis and hippocampal formation of 10 - weeks - old mice.

( A) Low magnification of the cortex temporalis presents an Annexin A7 expression in cells of the pial border, in neurons of all six isocortical laminae, and a weak signal in the adjacent white matter.

( F) Higher magnification of image ( A) also shows Annexin A7 in nuclei of neurons ( lamina granularis externa ( corpuscularis), arrowhead) and in the cytoplasm and nuclei of astrocytes ( lamina molecularis, arrow; GFAP - confirmed).

The nuclear localisation of Annexin A7 in mice observed in immature cells at E16 and differentiated adult neurons could be only detected as a strong signal when the brain sections were pre - treated with trypsin before antibody staining.

Differentiating cells, like the neural ectoderm, which is the origin of the cells belonging to the nervous system, show Annexin A7 immunoreactivity mainly in the cytosol.

The different expression patterns of Annexin A7 - positive cells from the ventricular germinative zone to the marginal zone of the later neocortex observed in this study are similar to the developmental patterns of Tenascin - C - positive astroglial precursors following the guidance of the radial glial cells [ 18].

In the adult brain we generally observed a nuclear localization for Annexin A7 in neurons whereas astrocytes exhibited both a cytosolic as well as a nuclear staining.

However, pyramidal neurons of the isocortex and Purkinje - cells of the cerebellum exhibited a cytosolic stain of intermediate intensity including their neurites and dendrites.

We have previously reported the expression of Annexin A7 in human temporal neocortex and hippocampus obtained from neurosurgery for therapy - refractory epilepsy and found the two Annexin A7 isoforms restricted to the cytoplasm and nuclei of astrocytes, whereas neurons lacked any signal [ 19].

We therefore favor the hypothesis that Annexin A7 in the sensitive neurons of the human autopsy brain may have similarly translocated to the cellular membrane.

Indeed, when we analyzed primary astrocytes from an AnxA7 - / - mouse for Ca2 + - dependent signaling processes, we found that they exhibited a significantly increased velocity of mechanically induced astrocytic Ca2 + - waves as compared to wild type [ 9].

In contrast, our studies show a relocation of Annexin A7 from the cytosol to the nucleus in cells of the embryonic neuronal tissue.

Together, our findings indicate that DRG sensory neurons exhibit a temporal developmental switch that can be revealed by distinct responses to ETS transcription factor signaling at sequential steps of neuronal maturation.

But whether the orderly expression and activity of transcriptional programs at much later developmental stages, well after cell cycle exit, is an essential step in the progression of neuronal differentiation and circuit assembly has yet to be resolved.

These two ETS proteins control late aspects of spinal monosynaptic circuit assembly, with Er81 directing proprioceptive sensory neuron differentiation and Pea3 directing motor neuron pool differentiation, respectively [ 14, 15].

Precocious initiation of ETS signaling in post - mitotic DRG neurons leads to abnormal DRG neuron differentiation characterized by neurotrophin - independent neurite outgrowth and inappropriate profiles of gene expression.

To further define DRG neuron differentiation in the presence of EWS - Pea3 in proprioceptive afferents in vivo, we assessed whether replacement of Er81 by EWS - Pea3 had an influence on neuronal survival or on the expression of proprioceptive - afferent - specific genes.

To assess whether synapses between Ia afferents and motor neurons are functional in Er81EWS - Pea3 / - mice, we performed intracellular recordings from identified quadriceps motor neurons after stimulation of nerves innervating the quadriceps muscle group.	"afferents and motor neurons	38	65	Cell"	"motor neurons	174	187	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""afferents and motor neurons"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""motor neurons"", ""start_span"": 174, ""end_span"": 187, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Together, these findings suggest that in the absence of Er81, EWS - Pea3 can direct the complex biological process of correct laminar termination within the ventral spinal cord and the formation of synapses with motor neurons ( Figure 2J - 2L), thus identifying an ETS transcription factor suitable for heterochronic expression experiments in DRG neurons.

We first assessed the influence of EWS - Pea3 expression in early post - mitotic DRG neurons on the establishment of afferent projections into the spinal cord using the TaumGFP / + allele or a Thy1 - promoter - driven synaptophysin green fluorescent protein ( spGFP) with an expression profile restricted to DRG sensory neurons at embryonic day ( E) 13. 5 ( Thy1spGFP; [ 25]) ( Figure 3).

These experiments permit assessment of whether precocious ETS transcription factor signaling influences neuronal survival and in vitro neurite outgrowth of DRG neurons, two parameters prominently influenced by target - derived neurotrophic factors and their receptors.	"neuronal	104	112	Cell"	"neurons	160	167	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 160, ""end_span"": 167, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In contrast, neurite outgrowth of Bax - / - DRG neurons was significantly less ( see Figure 4G) than that of either DRG from TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos cultured in the absence of neurotrophic support ( see Figure 4D) or Bax - / - DRG neurons cultured in the presence of neurotrophic support ( see Figure 4H and 4I).

These findings suggest that in addition to mediating neurotrophin - independent neuronal survival, expression of EWS - Pea3 in early post - mitotic neurons also promotes neurite outgrowth in a neurotrophin - independent manner.

Together with the in vitro culture experiments, these findings suggest that DRG neurons from TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos remain post - mitotic but fail to become sensitive to naturally occurring cell death, and survive in the absence of Trk receptors and neurotrophic support.

We next analyzed whether changes in the expression of proteins known to be involved in the regulation of neuronal survival or cell death could be detected in DRG of TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos.

In contrast, the expression level of the anti - apoptotic Bcl2 family members Bcl - xl and Bcl2 was significantly increased when compared to wild - type levels ( Bcl2, 157%; Bcl - xl, 259%; average of n = 3 independent experiments; Figure 6O and 6P), providing a potential molecular explanation for the enhanced neuronal survival of DRG neurons of TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos in the absence of Trk receptor expression [ 30].

The observed differences in neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth between precocious and isochronic expression of EWS - Pea3 prompted us to perform a direct comparative analysis of gene expression between mice with precocious EWS - Pea3 expression and mice in which the expression of EWS - Pea3 is initiated in DRG sensory neurons from the time of normal onset of Er81 expression.

Calretinin and Calbindin, two different calcium - binding proteins expressed by subpopulations of DRG neurons in wild - type, Er81EWS - Pea3 / -, and TauEWS - Pea3 / + PVCre / + embryos ( Figure 7E, 7G, and 7H; data not shown) [ 31, 32], were induced in more than 95% of all DRG neurons of TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos ( Figures 7F and S5).

These findings suggest that DRG neurons in TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos fail to differentiate to a normal fate and instead acquire an aberrant identity distinct from any subpopulation of wild - type DRG neurons.

Finally, to assess whether EWS - Pea3 expressed precociously acts exclusively cell - autonomously or whether it may also influence neighboring DRG neurons, we activated expression of EWS - Pea3 using Hb9Cre mice [ 33].	"cell	78	82	Cell"	"neurons	147	154	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Due to a transient and rostro - caudally graded expression of Hb9 at neural plate stages, very few DRG neurons at brachial levels and increasingly more neurons progressing caudally undergo recombination in TauEWS - Pea3 / + Hb9Cre / + and TaumGFP / + Hb9Cre / + embryos ( Figure 8).

More generally, they suggest that temporally regulated activation of transcriptional programs coupled to a particular fate induced in neurons at early developmental stages represents an important mechanism of neuronal maturation.

Recent experiments addressing the temporal constraints of transcription factor action in proliferating neural progenitor cells adds to the idea that defined temporal windows, during which transcription factors act to control distinct downstream target genes, are of key importance to neuronal fate acquisition.

The Kitl gene is crucial for differentiation of mast cells, and CF mice on the mixed background have much fewer mature mast cells than on the B6 background as revealed by less expression of Mcpt2.

However, there is also evidence for hypersecretion of mucus in CF [ 12], and it is likely that effector molecules released by mast cells and neutrophils ( histamine, proteases, prostaglandins) have an important role in stimulating mucus secretion.

Age - related bone loss has long been associated with an increase in marrow adipocytes, which are derived from the same mesenchymal lineage as osteoblasts in bone marrow.

During skeletal development, the anabolic activity of osteoblasts [ 1] is favored over the catabolic activity of osteoclasts [ 2], which results in a net gain in bone mass.

Similar findings were observed when embryonic mesenchymal multipotential progenitor cells C3H10T1 / 2 treated with Sam68 shRNA, were differentiated into osteoblasts with BMP2.

The pathway by which leptin regulates bone resorption was identified to involve the sympathetic nervous system relaying to the osteoblasts via the beta - adrenergic pathway leading to the release of growth factors including RANKL that causes the osteoclasts to thrive [ 8, 18 - 20].

These findings suggest that Sam68 may be regulating bone metabolism at two different levels: ( 1) the absence of Sam68 results in lower leptin levels that may reduce bone resorption via the sympathetic nervous system and ( 2) the absence of Sam68 favors osteoblast, rather than adipocyte, differentiation.

In all species, the embryonic gonad is made up of a mixed population of germ cells and somatic cells.

For example, both proliferation [ 9] and migration of cells to trigger testis cord formation [ 10, 11] appear to be closely integrated with Sertoli cell differentiation.	"cells	54	59	Cell"	"Sertoli cell	140	152	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Sertoli cell"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
It is believed that the Sertoli cell is the first cell type to differentiate in the gonad [ 17].	"Sertoli cell	24	36	Cell"	"cell	50	54	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Sertoli cell"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Based on the theory that Sertoli cells initiate all downstream testicular differentiation, this might imply that Sertoli differentiation had been initiated in Wnt4 - / - XX gonads.	"Sertoli cells	25	38	Cell"	"Sertoli	113	120	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Sertoli cells"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Sertoli"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We hypothesize that FGF9 functions in a feed - forward loop to expand Sertoli precursor cells, which secrete FGF9, to a critical threshold number sufficient to suppress Wnt4.	"Sertoli	70	77	Cell"	"cells	88	93	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Sertoli"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
However, by 12. 5 dpc, FGF9 was detected only in XY gonads in two domains: in cells near the surface of gonads and in cells located within testis cords.	"cells	78	83	Cell"	"cells	118	123	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
FGF9 expression within testis cords was localized to Sertoli cells and excluded from germ cells based on the germ cell membrane marker platelet / endothelial cell adhesion molecule ( PECAM) ( Figure 1D and 1F).	"Sertoli cells	53	66	Cell"	"germ cells	85	95	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Sertoli cells"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""germ cells"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
For in vitro cell culture, cells were isolated from 11. 5 dpc gonads free of mesonephroi, and cultured on extracellular matrix - coated coverslips with or without addition of purified FGF9 in culture media.

After culture for 24 h, SOX9 expression was monitored by an antibody specific to SOX9 in XX cells and control XY cells.	"cells	92	97	Cell"	"cells	113	118	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Notably, in Fgf9 - / - XY gonads, SOX9 was no longer detectable by 12. 5 dpc, and Sertoli precursor cells never began to organize into normal testis cord structures ( Figure 3F).	"Sertoli	82	89	Cell"	"cells	100	105	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Sertoli"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
These data indicate that although Fgf9 is not required for the up - regulation of Sox9 in vivo, it is indispensable to maintain Sox9 expression in Sertoli precursor cells.	"Sertoli	147	154	Cell"	"cells	165	170	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Sertoli"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 170, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Proliferating cells were more abundant and concentrated in a domain near the surface of wild - type XY gonads, and this XY - specific cell proliferation was evident in XY Sox9flox / Delta littermate controls ( Figure 3K).	"cells	14	19	Cell"	"cell	134	138	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This result supports the idea that there is a mutual interdependence between Sox9 and Fgf9 generating a positive feed - forward loop, and that both genes are required for the expansion of somatic cells, including Sertoli cell precursors, in XY gonads.	"cells	196	201	Cell"	"Sertoli cell	213	225	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 196, ""end_span"": 201, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Sertoli cell"", ""start_span"": 213, ""end_span"": 225, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Apoptotic cells were not observed in Fgf9 - / - gonads or in littermate controls at 12. 0 dpc, although Fgf9 - / - samples showed somewhat increased cell death in mesonephric tubules and ducts, another site of Fgf9 expression ( Figure 4G and 4H).

To determine whether the aborting of the male pathway in Fgf9 - / - Sertoli precursors was associated with the transition of supporting cells from male to female differentiation, we investigated expression of Wnt4, an ovary - promoting gene.	"Sertoli	68	75	Cell"	"supporting cells	125	141	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Sertoli"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""supporting cells"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In Fgf9 - / - XY gonads, cells initially embark on the Sertoli pathway, but in the absence of Fgf9 can neither maintain Sox9 expression nor establish downstream male pathways.	"cells	25	30	Cell"	"Sertoli	55	62	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Sertoli"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
For many years it was believed that the fate of each cell in the genital disk was under the cell - autonomous control of double sex ( dsx), the key regulator of the sex determination pathway.

However, mosaic studies have shown that the genetic sex of the cells in the anterior / posterior organizers of the disk, not the sex of the majority of cells in the disk, regulate the sexually dimorphic fate of the disk.

The interplay between cell - autonomous and non - cell - autonomous pathways in the mammalian gonad is not well understood.

However, FGF9 may act to trigger cell proliferation, increasing the number of Sertoli precursors above a threshold needed to stabilize the male pathway, consistent with threshold requirements deduced from earlier studies using XX <--> XY chimeric gonads [ 15].	"cell	33	37	Cell"	"Sertoli	78	85	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Sertoli"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Since Sertoli cells produce FGF9, loss of proliferation of Sertoli precursors may result in a reduction of the overall level of FGF9, and / or other male paracrine signals, below a critical threshold level required to antagonize the influence of WNT4.

This model is appealing, because it links cell proliferation, believed to be required for establishment of the male pathway [ 9], with Sertoli fate determination.

Based on our findings we propose that cells in the mammalian gonad are balanced between two competing cell fates by counterbalanced signaling pathways, Fgf9, expressed near the coelomic surface, and Wnt4, expressed near the mesonephric border ( Figure 7).

However, using homologous recombination in ES cells to generate mutant mice is an inefficient, slow and expensive method because ( i) homologous recombination typically occurs at low frequency in ES cells, requiring sophisticated selection schemes and screening of hundreds of clones to identify the desired mutant; ( ii) large ( 15 - 20 kb) plasmids, often difficult to clone, are required to increase targeting efficiency and ( iii) breeding mice to homozygosity and housing a mouse colony generate further delays and costs.

Here we report an approach that enables highly efficient targeting at the p53 locus in both ES cells and fibroblasts.

We show that our approach enables efficient targeting of marker - free mutations at the p53 locus in ES cells to generate mutant mice, but more importantly, it is Adapted for targeting in Somatic cells to Accelerate Phenotyping ( ASAP).

A total of 8 x 105 p53RMCE / + ES cells were grown without puromycin for 12 h, electroporated with 15 mu g CMV - Cre plasmid ( pOG231) and 200 mu g of the exchange construct, and plated in T25 flasks at 105 cells per flask.

The first step requires generating a floxed allele in ES cells that will serve as the substrate for subsequent exchanges ( RMCE - ready ES cell, Figure 1).

We next tested the efficiency of RMCE in ES cells, using a replacement construct encoding p53 fused to GFP ( p53GFP) to enable tracking p53 in individual live cells.

This, together with the observation that p53 levels decrease during mouse embryogenesis ( 19), suggested an explanation for the observed lack of pregnancies: we speculate that the high levels of p53GFP in the ES cells injected into blastocysts might have prevented normal embryonic development once these cells began to differentiate and the p53 pathway became functional.	"cells	212	217	Cell"	"cells	305	310	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 212, ""end_span"": 217, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 305, ""end_span"": 310, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
RMCE with p53GFP in ES cells showed that p53GFP is expressed at high levels ( Figure 3A), and as mentioned before, the p53 pathway that can be activated in MEFs is not readily activated in ES cells ( 18).

We observed a few fluorescent cells only when the Cre expression plasmid was co - electroporated, suggesting that such cells resulted from RMCE.

The success of RMCE - ASAP relied on the integrated use of inverted heterologous loxP sites, a positive / negative selection marker that preserves the germline capacity of ES cells, and, for somatic cells, the existence of a knock - out allele of the gene of interest.

Hence, after breeding the RMCE - ready mouse with mice heterozygotes for the GOI, somatic cells with an RMCE - ready locus and a WT or KO allele can be recovered [ e. g.

For example, the Ran - binding domains RBDn = 1 - 4 of RanBP2 associate with the nuclear import co - receptor, importin - beta [ 10, 11], and antibodies against RanBP2 inhibit the nuclear import pathway in HeLa cells [ 3]; but such a role seems dispensable in Xenopus oocytes [ 12].

High - resolution images of dissociated primary cerebral neurons and glial cells confirmed that the colocalization of HKI and Cox11 was highly restricted ( P - R), while RanBP2 extensively colocalized with HKI ( S - U) and mHsp70 ( V - Z).

The differences in the photopic ( light - adapted) responses, initiated by cone photoreceptors, which make up 3% of the photosensory neurons in the mouse retina [ 38], were less obvious but still exhibited a trend toward reduced amplitudes across a range of increasing light stimulus intensities ( Figure 8B).

While ALK5 is not required for neural crest cell migration, our results demonstrate that it plays an important role in the survival of post - migratory cardiac neural crest cells.

To determine, whether ALK5 would also mediate unique non - redundant signaling events in cardiac neural crest cells, we focused on cardiac and pharyngeal phenotypes of mouse embryos lacking Alk5 specifically in neural crest cells.

These observed differences are likely due to substantial apoptosis of Alk5 - deficient post - migratory neural crest cells, which is clearly detectable at E10. 5, whereas similar intense cell death has not been reported in Tgfbr2 / Wnt1 - Cre mutants [ 9].

Our present results suggest that while TGF - beta signaling in cardiac NCCs is predominantly mediated via the ALK5 / TGF - beta RII receptor complex, ALK5 also mediates signaling of other related ligands, which are either directly or indirectly required for appropriate NCC survival.

Already at E10. 5, we could see intense apoptosis among the postmigratory NCCs in the mesenchyme surrounding the aortic sac at the site where the prospective AP septum forms, i. e., this cell death precedes the AP septal defect seen in mutants.

Although some NC - derived cells appeared to be differentiating to smooth muscle cells in the OFT ( Fig. 6), we could never detect the AP septum forming in Alk5 / Wnt1 - Cre mutants between E10. 5 and E11. 5.

By E17. 5, the mineralized cartilage that makes up the late hypertrophic zone of the growth plate normally undergoes removal by osteoclasts ( Figure 5G, brown - stained cells, red arrows), resulting in the formation of a bone marrow cavity ( red arrow in Figure 5E and 5I, see also Figure 6).

For example, there is a higher failure rate for meiosis in females, with human oocyte aneuploidy rates up to 25% versus about 2% in human sperm [ 3], and this may indicate that the checkpoints controlling and monitoring the events of meiotic progression in males are more stringent.

DMRT7 also is specifically localized in sperm, with antibody staining mainly in the perinuclear ring of the sperm head manchette.

We identified three homologously targeted ES cell clones by Southern blotting ( Figure S2B) and injected cells from two clones into C57BL / 6 blastocysts.

Prior to postnatal day 14 ( P14), mutant testes appeared histologically normal and the testis weights were similar to those of heterozygous and wild - type littermates, indicating that spermatogonia and early meiotic germ cells form normally ( Figure 2B; unpublished data).

Microscopic examination of P21 and P42 Dmrt7 mutant testes revealed that germ cells arrest in pachynema, and later stages of germ cells are largely missing ( Figure 2C and 2D).	"germ cells	73	83	Cell"	"germ cells	125	135	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""germ cells"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""germ cells"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
No significant difference is observed at 14 d ( B), but by 21 d some tubules are lacking abundant spermatocytes ( C, asterisk) or cells with typical apoptotic morphology are present ( open arrowhead, C and D).

Since Dmrt7 mutant testes lack most post - pachytene cells, we used TUNEL analysis to test whether the missing cells are eliminated by apoptosis.

In mutants, many apoptotic cells were in the middle of the tubules, whereas the apoptotic cells in wild - type occur mainly near the seminiferous tubule periphery.

The numbers of Sertoli cells were not significantly different between wild - type and mutant testes, and we observed no difference in somatic cell apoptosis in mutants ( unpublished data).	"Sertoli cells	15	28	Cell"	"cell	142	146	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Sertoli cells"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
To better define the spermatogenic stage at which Dmrt7 - / - male germ cells arrest and die, we used antibodies against several stage - specific germ cell markers.	"male germ cells	62	77	Cell"	"germ cell	146	155	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""male germ cells"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""germ cell"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 155, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Dmrt7 mutant testes had BC7 - positive cells in approximately normal numbers, but again abnormally organized, with many positive cells in the center rather than the periphery of the tubules ( Figure 3B).

The TRA369 antibody recognizes a calmegin protein expressed in pachytene spermatocytes through elongated spermatids [ 45].

We also quantitated the number of cells at each meiotic stage using spermatocyte spreads, assaying chromosome - pairing status by staining for SYCP3, a component of the synaptonemal complex ( Figure 4).	"cells	34	39	Cell"	"spermatocyte	68	80	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""spermatocyte"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We found that Dmrt7 mutants accumulate pachytene cells but have greatly reduced numbers of cells in late - pachynema and beyond.

Although we did not detect DMRT7 expression in Sertoli cells by antibody staining, we nevertheless considered the possibility that Sertoli cell defects might contribute to the male - specific germ line failure of Dmrt7 mutants.	"Sertoli cells	47	60	Cell"	"Sertoli cell	131	143	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Sertoli cells"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Sertoli cell"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
However, the organization of Sertoli cells in Dmrt7 mutant testes was abnormal: in some tubules GATA1 - positive Sertoli cell nuclei were displaced from their usual close apposition with the basement membrane ( Figure 6C).	"Sertoli cells	29	42	Cell"	"Sertoli cell	113	125	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Sertoli cells"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Sertoli cell"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Most Sertoli cell nuclei were adjacent to the basal membrane in wild - type, but mutant Sertoli cells were displaced in some tubules ( arrowhead).	"Sertoli cell	5	17	Cell"	"Sertoli cells	88	101	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Sertoli cell"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Sertoli cells"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
These results suggest the germ cell defects of Dmrt7 mutants are not caused by lack of Dmrt7 in Sertoli cells.	"germ cell	26	35	Cell"	"Sertoli cells	96	109	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""germ cell"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Sertoli cells"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
gamma H2AX localized normally to the XY body of DMRT7 mutant cells in meiotic spreads ( Figure 7A), and many gamma H2AX - positive puncta were present in germ cells of Dmrt7 mutant testes ( Figure 7B).	"cells	61	66	Cell"	"germ cells	154	164	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""germ cells"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 164, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
However, some tubules in mutants had multiple layers of cells with SUMO - 1 - condensed spots ( Figure 7C), rather than the normal single layer of cells.	"cells	56	61	Cell"	"cells	147	152	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This accumulation of XY body - containing cells also was apparent with gamma H2AX staining and is consistent with a developmental arrest of mutant cells in mid - to late - pachytene.	"cells	42	47	Cell"	"cells	147	152	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Wild - type cell ( E) has HP1 beta throughout XY body, whereas mutant cell ( H) only has localization to X chromosome centromere ( arrowhead).

Although most Dmrt7 mutant cells are eliminated by apoptosis prior to diplonema, we were able to examine epigenetic markers of PMSC in rare Dmrt7 mutant spermatocytes that escaped pachytene arrest and progressed into diplonema.	"cells	27	32	Cell"	"spermatocytes	153	166	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""spermatocytes"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 166, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In one experiment, 11 / 27 mutant cells in diplonema lacked HP1 beta on the XY body, as compared with 2 / 22 wild - type cells.

Because this process could be abnormal in the mutant cells, we also staged mutant cells by chromosome morphology using an antibody to SYCP3 ( Figure 9).

Since the arrest and apoptosis of Dmrt7 mutant spermatocytes could result from perturbation of any of the critical pachytene events mentioned above, we tested whether they occur abnormally in the mutant cells.	"spermatocytes	47	60	Cell"	"cells	203	208	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""spermatocytes"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 203, ""end_span"": 208, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Normally cells accumulate H3 - 2meK9 and H3 - 3meK9 marks and HP1 beta protein on the sex chromatin as they progress to diplonema, but we observed mutant diplotene cells lacking these features.

A proportion of mutant diplotene cells have apparently normal sex chromatin ( for example, Figure 8M); these are likely to be the cells that can progress beyond diplonema.

In both wild - type ( top) and mutant ( bottom) testis sections, androgen receptor protein is expressed in Sertoli cell and peritubular myoid cell.

Pre - meiotic cells near the basal membrane express high level of RBMY whereas SUMO - 1 - positive pachytene cells do not express RBMY, in both wild - type and mutant, indicating proper silencing.

The chromosomes still synapsed normally, but animals were sterile due to massive death of oocytes and spermatocytes.

Zygotene / pachytene spermatocytes stained less strongly, and there was no detectable staining in late pachytene spermatocytes.

The majority of oocyte loss occurred in late embryogenesis or early in postnatal development, since 2 d postpartum ovaries were markedly smaller than those of control littermates, and were lacking oocytes or newly forming follicles ( Figure 3C and 3D).	"oocyte	16	22	Cell"	"oocytes	197	204	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""oocyte"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""oocytes"", ""start_span"": 197, ""end_span"": 204, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Since we observed oocytes with pachytene stage chromosomes in 17. 5 d Trip13Gt / Gt embryonic ovaries ( unpublished data), this indicates that oocytes were eliminated somewhere between pachynema and dictyate.	"oocytes	18	25	Cell"	"oocytes	143	150	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""oocytes"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""oocytes"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
A tubule with spermatocytes at leptotene / zygotene transition is labeled ZP, and tubules with apoptotic spermatocytes are marked with an asterisk.

Some sections of adult seminiferous tubules contained postmeiotic spermatids ( Figure 3G), although we saw no motile epididymal sperm.

These drastic meiotic defects stand in contrast to yeast and C. elegans, in which deletion of Pch2 alone has minor effects on spore / gamete development [ 2, 8].

Nevertheless, since Trip13Gt / Gt spermatocytes progress to pachynema with no gross SC abnormalities, and oocytes were eliminated soon after birth ( a characteristic of DNA repair mutants [ 13]), this suggested that unrepaired DSBs are responsible for eventual meiotic arrest and elimination.	"spermatocytes	34	47	Cell"	"oocytes	106	113	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""spermatocytes"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""oocytes"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
To assess whether these MLH1 / 3 foci in Trip13Gt / Gt pachytene spermatocytes represent CO events completed to a point where they could maintain interhomolog attachments though the end of prophase I, we treated testicular cells from 17. 5 - 20. 5 - d - old control ( + / +), Trip13Gt / Gt, and Dmc1 - / - mice with the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid ( OA), a chemical that induces degradation of the SC, chromosome condensation, and premature progression to metaphase I [ 33].

Because the preparations were made from whole testes, it is possible that the univalent - containing metaphases from Dmc1 - / - mice were from spermatogonia, not spermatocytes.	"spermatogonia	143	156	Cell"	"spermatocytes	162	175	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""spermatogonia"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""spermatocytes"", ""start_span"": 162, ""end_span"": 175, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Spermatocytes in Trip13Gt / Gt Spo11 - / - testes progressed maximally to that point before undergoing death ( Figs 3I), well before the spindle checkpoint that eliminates achiasmate spermatocytes [ 36].

There was no evidence of metaphase I spermatocytes or postmeiotic spermatids in these testes, unlike those seen in Trip13 single mutants ( Figure 3G).	"spermatocytes	37	50	Cell"	"spermatids	66	76	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""spermatocytes"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""spermatids"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In contrast to the complete synapsis in Trip13Gt / Gt pachytene spermatocytes ( Figure 5A), in which SPO11 is available in leptonema to initiate ( via DSB induction, Figure S2A and S2B) a recombination - driven homolog search, chromosome synapsis in doubly mutant spermatocytes was highly disrupted as in Spo11 single mutants ( Figure 5B and 5C).	"spermatocytes	64	77	Cell"	"spermatocytes	264	277	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""spermatocytes"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""spermatocytes"", ""start_span"": 264, ""end_span"": 277, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
As in Dmc1 - / - mice, in which spermatocytes undergo meiotic arrest from defective DSB repair and failed chromosome synapsis [ 16], spermatogenesis in Dmc1 - / - Trip13Gt / Gt testes was uniformly arrested at the point where spermatocytes contained chromatin characteristic of zygonema / pachynema ( Figure 3N).	"spermatocytes	32	45	Cell"	"spermatocytes	226	239	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""spermatocytes"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""spermatocytes"", ""start_span"": 226, ""end_span"": 239, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We base this conclusion on two observations: ( 1) oocyte elimination is dependent upon DSB formation and ( 2) synapsis is normal in spermatocytes of adult testes.

Furthermore, our results allow us to conclude that oocytes and spermatocytes share a similar, if not identical, DNA damage pachytene checkpoint that is decoupled from a synapsis checkpoint.

Interestingly, we found that OA treatment of Trip13Gt / Gt spermatocytes could propel them into MI, despite a report that the same did not occur when wild - type pachytene spermatocytes were treated with the DSB - inducing agents gamma radiation or etoposide [ 53].
