The lack of immature hair cells seems to affect also the formation of pillar cells ( undifferentiated almost throughout the cochlea; Fig. 4) and Deiters ' cells ( not recognizable based on their morphology), a suggestion consistent with recent molecular data on the interaction of hair cells and supporting cells [ 17, 18].

CH and CSC planned and carried out the experiments with the red blood cells and platelets and the fractionation studies and drafted the manuscript, GL was responsible for platelets, RK gave support on the ADVIA 120 cell counter, evaluated and discussed the results, SMP and BSG gave support on the APACT system, platelet aggregation experiments, and evaluated the results, CZ was responsible for the sorcin studies, MS studied the cytoskeletal activities of the protein, AAN conceived of the studies and participated in its design.

To elucidate the consequences of the common JNCL mutation in neuronal cells, we used P4 knock - in mouse cerebella to establish conditionally immortalized CbCln3 wild - type, heterozygous, and homozygous neuronal precursor cell lines, which can be differentiated into MAP - 2 and NeuN - positive, neuron - like cells.

Analysis of the mechanisms by which transcription factor programs can be shifted over time to control different complements of downstream genes and thus different aspects of neuronal and cellular fates in progenitor cells or post - mitotic neurons may provide further insight into the way in which transcription factors act to control the assembly of neuronal circuits.

Immunofluorescent staining with purified DMRT7 antisera showed that DMRT7 protein is expressed predominantly in mid - to late - pachytene spermatocytes ( Figure 1C), as well as in sperm, and is not detectable in other germ cell types including spermatogonia and round spermatids.
