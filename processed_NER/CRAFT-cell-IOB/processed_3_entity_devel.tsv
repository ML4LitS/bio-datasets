For example, while the expanded domain of Agouti expression in postnatal deH / deH animals can be traced to events that occur between E11. 5 and E13. 5, the underlying cause may be that embryonic cells in dorsolateral mesenchyme acquire a ventral rather than dorsal identity or that those cells fail to proliferate normally, followed by compensatory expansion of ventral cells.

The functional diversity of the novel cone - specific genes identified here indicates molecular differences between rods and cones extending far beyond those previously discovered.

In mammals, there are two types of photoreceptors: rods and cones.

Surprisingly, the majority of photoreceptors in this mutant mouse were found to have features of both normal rods and cones.

Enhanced S - cone syndrome ( ESCS) is an unusual disease of photoreceptors that includes night blindness ( suggestive of rod dysfunction), an abnormal electroretinogram ( ERG) with a waveform that is nearly identical under both light and dark adaptation, and an increased sensitivity of the ERG to short - wavelength light [ 1, 2].

Microarray and in situ hybridization analyses revealed a modest increase in the number of S - opsin - positive cells and widespread derepression of many cone - specific genes within rod photoreceptor cells.	"cells	111	116	Cell"	"cone	153	157	Cell"	"rod photoreceptor cells	182	205	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""rod photoreceptor cells"", ""start_span"": 182, ""end_span"": 205, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
S - opsin was expressed in 3. 2% of retinal cells in the rd7 mutant ( 66 S - opsin - positive cells out of 2, 056 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole [ DAPI] - positive cells).	"cells	44	49	Cell"	"cells	94	99	Cell"	"cells	166	171	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 166, ""end_span"": 171, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Previous studies have estimated that the total number of cones in the mouse retina is 2% of all retinal cells [ 20], and that S - opsin is largely repressed in cones in the dorsal third of the retina [ 21].	"cones	57	62	Cell"	"cells	104	109	Cell"	"cones	160	165	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cones"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cones"", ""start_span"": 160, ""end_span"": 165, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The fact that only 3. 2% of all retinal cells are S - opsin - positive in the rd7 mutant also confirms that the majority of the photoreceptors ( which make up just over 70% of the cells in the adult mouse retina) do not express this gene.	"cells	40	45	Cell"	"photoreceptors	128	142	Cell"	"cells	180	185	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""photoreceptors"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 180, ""end_span"": 185, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Although such a pattern of transcript localization is commonly seen in many rod - specific genes ( e. g., Rho in Figure 2; Pcdh21, Rbp3, and Cnga1 in Table S2), it is not easily appreciated in cone - specific genes, possibly due to the relative scarcity of cones in the mouse.	"rod	76	79	Cell"	"cone	193	197	Cell"	"cones	257	262	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 193, ""end_span"": 197, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cones"", ""start_span"": 257, ""end_span"": 262, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Some of these genes showed faint expression in a cone - like distribution ( see Table S1, genes G36, G40, and G44), and one appeared to be expressed throughout the ONL but at greater levels in cones than in rods ( Table S1, gene G37).	"cone	49	53	Cell"	"cones	193	198	Cell"	"rods	207	211	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cones"", ""start_span"": 193, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""rods"", ""start_span"": 207, ""end_span"": 211, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In addition to the three rod genes depicted in Figure 2, in situ hybridization analysis on an additional 19 rod - specific and pan - photoreceptor genes demonstrated only a very mild diminution of expression in two of these genes, gucy2e and Rgs9, at P14, and an increase in expression in two, Nr2e3, and Cnga1 ( Table S2).	"rod	25	28	Cell"	"rod	108	111	Cell"	"photoreceptor	133	146	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This latter finding suggests that all the rod - and many cone - specific genes are coexpressed in the majority of photoreceptors in the rd7 mutant.

This experiment confirmed that the average area of the rod - like somata in rd7 is approximately 30% larger than that of wild - type rod somata ( mean area in rd7 was 9. 75 +/- 1. 36 ( standard deviation) mu m2, compared to wild - type rods, with 7. 53 +/- 0. 72 mu m2; n = 50; p = 7. 6 x 10 - 16, Student ' s t - test).

Such juxtanuclear organelles are only very rarely seen in normal rods ( 1. 5%; six out of 399 cells counted), but are common in cones ( yellow arrow in Figure 7H).

In this paper we have determined that the primary role of the rod - specific transcription factor, Nr2e3, is to maintain cone genes transcriptionally silent within rods.	"rod	62	65	Cell"	"cone	121	125	Cell"	"rods	164	168	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""rods"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 168, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Consistent with the hybrid pattern of gene expression in these cells, electron microscopic analysis revealed them to be morphologically intermediate between normal rods and cones.

Although genes showing type I derepression demonstrated staining in the majority of cells in the ONL, two lines of evidence suggest that these genes are not completely derepressed in these cells when compared to their expression in S - opsin - expressing cones.	"cells	84	89	Cell"	"cells	189	194	Cell"	"cones	255	260	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 189, ""end_span"": 194, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cones"", ""start_span"": 255, ""end_span"": 260, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
"As this diagram implies, there appear to be at least two different repressors of cone genes within rods, Nr2e3 and either Nrl itself or an additional unknown transcription factor downstream of Nrl, here termed "" transcription factor X. "" In fact, it appears that the differences between type I and type II cone genes may simply depend on which repressor -- Nr2e3 or transcription factor X -- is primarily responsible for the regulation of the gene in question."

One of the most curious findings in the rd7 mutant retina was the occurrence of two different types of changes: an increase in the number of S - opsin - expressing cones and a transformation of rods into hybrid photoreceptors.	"cones	164	169	Cell"	"rods	194	198	Cell"	"photoreceptors	211	225	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cones"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 169, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""rods"", ""start_span"": 194, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""photoreceptors"", ""start_span"": 211, ""end_span"": 225, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This conclusion raises this question: Why does loss of a single transcription factor within rod precursors lead to two alternative fates -- a hybrid cell type on the one hand and apparently normal S - cones on the other?	"rod	92	95	Cell"	"cell	149	153	Cell"	"cones	201	206	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 149, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cones"", ""start_span"": 201, ""end_span"": 206, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
First, it is possible that there are two distinct types of rod precursor; loss of Nr2e3 in one leads to S - cone fate and in the other results in a hybrid cell type.	"rod	59	62	Cell"	"cone	108	112	Cell"	"cell	155	159	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 159, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
An alternative explanation would be that there is only a single, homogeneous population of postmitotic rod precursors in the mouse, and a stochastic event triggers assumption of the S - cone fate in a small subpopulation of these cells in the rd7 mutant.	"rod	103	106	Cell"	"cone	186	190	Cell"	"cells	230	235	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 186, ""end_span"": 190, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 230, ""end_span"": 235, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Namely, the signal is unlikely to derive from a population of cells coexpressing both rod and cone genes but whose photopigment is rhodopsin and not S - cone opsin.

The most significant opportunity presented by the MSUD mouse models is to test novel treatments such as gene [ 38 - 41] and cell based therapies ( e. g., hepatocytes [ 42, 43] or embryonic stem cells [ 44]).

To investigate a possible cell - cycle defect in the absence of Atrx, we analysed the cell cycle distribution of bromodeoxyuridine ( BrdU) - pulsed ES cells by flow cytometry ( Figure S1A).	"cell	26	30	Cell"	"cell	86	90	Cell"	"cells	151	156	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 151, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Surprisingly, both Atrxnull ES cell clones exhibited a cell cycle profile that was indistinguishable from ES cells bearing a functional Atrx allele ( AtrxWT or Atrxflox).	"cell	31	35	Cell"	"cell	55	59	Cell"	"cells	109	114	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Finally, we investigated whether the growth defect in the Atrxnull ES cells was due to an up - regulation of apoptosis by staining cells with Annexin V ( Figure S2) and found that the proportion of apoptotic cells was not significantly affected by the absence of full - length Atrx.	"cells	70	75	Cell"	"cells	131	136	Cell"	"apoptotic cells	198	213	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 198, ""end_span"": 213, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Thus, the growth defect observed in ES cells lacking Atrx is not due to a specific cell cycle block or significant induction of cell death.	"cells	39	44	Cell"	"cell	83	87	Cell"	"cell	128	132	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
While the cause of the proliferative delay is not yet clear, since Atrxnull ES cells appear to undergo higher rates of spontaneous differentiation ( unpublished data), it seems likely that the observed growth defect reflects the spontaneous transition from fast - cycling, undifferentiated ES cells into more slowly cycling, differentiated cell types in these cultures.

Although initially small and quickly diluted in normal embryos, the cellular subpopulation that inactivates the Xm chromosome could rapidly expand to replace the normally imprinted cells in extraembryonic lineages if the normal silencing of Xp compromises cell growth or differentiation.

However, there were small populations of lightly stained cells by H & E extending from the edge of the outer cortex towards inner medulla ( Figure 6E), and these cells showed intense nuclear beta - catenin staining whereas the rest of the medullary cells showed diffuse beta - catenin staining pattern similar to that of the control ( Figure 6F).

These cells were more like basal cells of the skin than TECs and were adjacent to the most immature looking cells that were showing strong nuclear and cytoplasmic beta - catenin staining ( Figure 6J).

However, cells with nuclear beta - catenin and K8 + K14 + double - positive epithelial cells increased subsequently, associated with active proliferation in the latter group of cells and loss of TEC compartments.

These results suggest that with the deletion of Apc in TECs, stabililization and nuclear localization of beta - catenin took place and subsequently these cells differentiated into keratinocytes that expressed both K14 and K8, similar to the basal cells of the skin, instead of TEC subsets.

The expansion and differentiation of these keratinocytes lead to loss of proper thymic epithelial compartments and in turn produced and deposited the hard keratins that consequently caused vast amount of neutrophils and macrophages to infiltrate the thymus.
