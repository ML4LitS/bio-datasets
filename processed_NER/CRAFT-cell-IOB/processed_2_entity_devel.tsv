In the embryo, alterations in the determination or migration of melanoblasts from the neural crest affect the number or distribution of pigment cells in the skin ( reviewed in Reedy et al. 1998).

Secreted by dermal papilla cells within each hair follicle ( Millar et al. 1995), Agouti protein causes melanocytes in that follicle to switch from the production of brown / black eumelanin to red / yellow pheomelanin.

At this stage, melanoblast migration from the neural crest is mostly complete, but there is a dorsoventral gradient in melanocyte differentiation and pigment synthesis.

Among other T - box genes whose developmental actions are at least partially understood, two general themes have emerged, one focused on the ability to specify alternative fates for an undifferentiated group of precursor cells and another focused on the ability to support proliferative expansion of a cell population whose fate is already determined ( reviewed in Tada and Smith 2001).

Both Tbx15 and Lmx1b act autonomously in mesenchymal cells to promote a dorsal identity, yet have expression domains that do not correspond to cell lineage compartments in the flank ( Tbx15) or the limb ( Lmx1b) ( Altabef et al. 1997; Michaud et al. 1997).

We speculate that a diffusible signal from dorsal trunk ectoderm, at or prior to E11. 5, promotes expression of Tbx15 in dorsal trunk mesenchyme, which then establishes dorsal positional identity of those cells as manifested by differences in Agouti expression, pigment - cell development, and hair growth.

In at / at mice, reduced hair melanocyte activity and high levels of Agouti mRNA in the ventrum lead to a cream color; as melanocyte activity gradually increases towards the dorsum, a lateral stripe is apparent on the flank.

Impaired pre - alveolar development of varying severity, inhibited cell proliferation, delayed differentiation of type I alveolar epithelial cells ( AECs) and delayed vascular development were all evident in knockout lungs.

Does the loss of normal cholesterol biosynthesis lead to abnormalities of cell proliferation / division or cell death?

Thus, at the late gestational stages, cell proliferation / division was impaired in knockout embryos with no increase in cell death rates.

The normal distal saccules of wild - type ( + / +) at near term ( E20. 5) showed typical type I ( t1) and type II ( t2) epithelial cells ( panel A, arrowheads), but knockout ( - / -) littermate lungs showed less developed saccules lined by columnar epithelial cells ( panel B, black arrowheads), with partially arrested tubules in the distal lung ( panel B, green arrowheads).

Immunostaining for type I cell markers T1 alpha and AQP5 demonstrated an intense staining in flat epithelial cells in wild - type lungs at E20. 5 ( panels C and E, arrowheads).

In contrast, the terminal epithelial cells positively stained by megalin antibodies in knockout lungs were comprised mainly of undifferentiated cuboidal cells ( compare the arrowheads in G and H).

At E20. 5, cav - 1 alpha stained cells in knockout lungs were embedded in a relatively thick mesenchyme surrounding undeveloped epithelial tubules, and these epithelial cells remained cuboidal, instead of flattening out ( Fig. 8, panel F).

Therefore, it appears that growth retardation caused by cholesterol deficiency was primarily because of an inhibition of cell growth and proliferation, rather than an increase in cell death.

Thus, changes in the complement of TACC1 isoforms in the cell may result in alterations in cellular RNA metabolism at multiple levels, and may account for the observation that TACC1D and TACC1F isoforms are associated with tumorigenic changes in gastric mucosa [ 18].

Although Pax3 and MyoD expression is detected in the PPF, a detailed analysis of transcription factors responsible for muscle precursor cell migration and differentiation will need to be completed both in the PPF and along the pathway of muscle precursor cell migration between the PPF and the membranous diaphragm.

In this study, we have examined the photoreceptor cells of the retinal degeneration 7 ( rd7) mutant mouse, a model for the human enhanced S - cone syndrome ( ESCS).

Employing microarray and in situ hybridization analysis we have found that the rd7 retina contains a modestly increased number of S - opsin - expressing cells that ultrastructurally appear to be normal cones.

In addition, in situ hybridization screening of genes shown to be up - regulated in the rd7 mutant retina by microarray identified ten new cone - specific or cone - enriched genes with a wide range of biochemical functions, including two genes specifically involved in glucose / glycogen metabolism.

"Subsequent studies, however, concluded that the ERG was due to supernumerary short - wavelength ( "" blue "") cone photoreceptors ( S - cones) in these patients [ 1, 2, 9 - 11]."

Histopathologic analysis of a retina from a human patient with ESCS and extensive retinal degeneration demonstrated an absence of rhodopsin - positive cells and an increase in the number of S - cone opsin - expressing cells.	"cells	151	156	Cell"	"cells	218	223	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 151, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 218, ""end_span"": 223, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
These experiments demonstrated widespread up - regulation of cone - specific and cone - enriched genes in the rd7 retina, especially by postnatal day 14 ( P14) and P21 ( Figure 1).	"cone	61	65	Cell"	"cone	81	85	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Most known cone - specific or cone - enriched genes were found to be up - regulated in the mutant ( Figure 1, genes G1 - G15).

This pattern of expression contrasts sharply with the usual pattern of cone gene expression, which consists of scattered cells localized to the scleral edge of the ONL ( Figure 2).	"cone	71	75	Cell"	"cells	121	126	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The second category of cone gene derepression ( type II) consisted of a patchy, salt - and - pepper pattern of ectopic expression in which individual positive cells were scattered throughout the ONL ( Figure 2, upper right photomicrographs; Table S1).	"cone	23	27	Cell"	"cells	159	164	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 164, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Although numerous positive cells were present in the rd7 retina ( particularly in the ventral portion), there were clearly many interspersed cells that showed a complete absence of expression.

In order to assess whether these supernumerary S - opsin - expressing cells coexpressed rod - specific markers, a double antibody staining for S - opsin and rhodopsin was performed.	"cells	70	75	Cell"	"rod	88	91	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
"This finding suggests that the supernumerary S - opsin - expressing cells in the rd7 retina may represent normal "" blue "" cones."

Given that the majority of known cone - specific genes showed marked derepression in the rd7 mutant, additional candidate genes up - regulated on microarray analysis were evaluated for cone - specific expression.	"cone	33	37	Cell"	"cone	185	189	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 185, ""end_span"": 189, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Of these, at least ten showed a definite cone - specific or cone - enriched pattern of expression in the wild - type retina ( Figure 1, genes G26 - G35).	"cone	41	45	Cell"	"cone	60	64	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Note that in the wild - type retina, there is a relatively weak pattern of scattered positive cells at the scleral edge of the ONL, consistent with a cone - specific pattern of expression.	"cells	94	99	Cell"	"cone	150	154	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Despite this apparent absence of cone staining, the pattern of derepression in rd7 suggests that these genes may also be novel cone - specific genes, albeit expressed at levels below the sensitivity threshold of our in situ hybridization assay.	"cone	33	37	Cell"	"cone	127	131	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In terms of functional categorization, the novel cone genes cover a broad range including glucose metabolism ( Pygm and Glo1), fatty acid metabolism ( Elovl2), DNA repair ( Smug1), cell cycle / chromosome segregation ( Bub1b), carcinogenesis ( Tcta), endothelial biology ( Ece1), cytoskeletal function ( Ebp4. 1l1), and even otolith formation ( Otop3).

A relatively frequent finding among both previously identified cone - specific genes, as well as in some of those identified in the present study, is the occurrence of gene expression in an early photoreceptor precursor pattern ( Figure 5).	"cone	63	67	Cell"	"photoreceptor	196	209	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 196, ""end_span"": 209, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Two of the 11 novel cone genes identified in this study also have this early photoreceptor pattern of expression ( Ece1 and Otop3).	"cone	20	24	Cell"	"photoreceptor	77	90	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Although the significance of such early photoreceptor expression is not known, it is possible that these genes may also be cone - specific but are expressed at undetectably low levels in the adult.	"photoreceptor	40	53	Cell"	"cone	123	127	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In sharp contrast to changes in cone gene expression, rod - specific genes were much less severely affected in the rd7 mutant.

This in situ hybridization pattern is consistent with staining in M u ller glia, the principal glial cell type of the mouse retina.

The cell bodies were chosen for evaluation rather than the outer segments, since in the mouse, the ultrastructural differences between rod and cone somata are much greater than are the differences between the outer segments [ 26].	"rod	135	138	Cell"	"cone	143	147	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 147, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Analysis of toluidine blue - stained semi - thin sections revealed that such cone - like cells were present in greater abundance in the rd7 retina than in wild - type, and that their somata were scattered throughout the ONL ( Figure 7).	"cone	77	81	Cell"	"cells	89	94	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
A comparison between the distribution of these cells and those expressing S - cone opsin strongly suggests that they represent the same cell population ( compare Figure 7D and 7F).	"cells	47	52	Cell"	"cell	136	140	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Analysis of the nuclear morphology of dissociated retinal cells stained for S - cone opsin by dissociated cell in situ hybridization confirmed that this is the case ( unpublished data).

First, the euchromatin is, on average, more abundant in these cells than in wild - type rods ( compare Figure 7G and 7H).	"cells	62	67	Cell"	"rods	88	92	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""rods"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The first pattern of derepression identified ( type I) consists of ectopic expression of cone genes in the vast majority of cells in the ONL.	"cone	89	93	Cell"	"cells	124	129	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
These cells were also shown to coexpress all rod genes tested.	"cells	6	11	Cell"	"rod	45	48	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
First, close evaluation of the staining pattern of a number of type I genes in the rd7 mutant retina ( e. g., see Table S1, genes G9, G19, and G24), reveals that, in addition to the background staining throughout the ONL, there is a more darkly staining subpopulation of cells scattered throughout this layer in a distribution corresponding to that of the supernumerary S - cone opsin - expressing cells.	"cells	271	276	Cell"	"cells	398	403	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 271, ""end_span"": 276, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 398, ""end_span"": 403, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This pattern of staining suggests that these genes are more highly expressed in S - opsin expressing cells than in the hybrid cells of the rd7 retina.	"cells	101	106	Cell"	"cells	126	131	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
As mentioned above, Nrl is a retinal transcription factor that, when mutated, results in en masse conversion of rods into S - opsin - expressing cones [ 24].	"rods	112	116	Cell"	"cones	145	150	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rods"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cones"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
It can be inferred from this fact that Nrl is absolutely required for the normal silencing of cone - specific genes in rods.	"cone	94	98	Cell"	"rods	119	123	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""rods"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This finding further suggests that, in addition to its repression of cone gene expression via induction of Nr2e3 expression, Nrl exerts an additional level of negative control over cone genes either directly or via a second, as yet uncharacterized, repressor.	"cone	69	73	Cell"	"cone	181	185	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 181, ""end_span"": 185, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The second pattern of derepression seen in the rd7 retina ( type II), is represented by a scattered population of cells throughout the ONL that shows derepression of several cone - specific genes, including S - cone opsin.	"cells	114	119	Cell"	"cone	174	178	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 174, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
By ultrastructural criteria, these cells appear to be normal cones, albeit with displaced cell bodies.	"cells	35	40	Cell"	"cones	61	66	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cones"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Nevertheless, previous studies have suggested that Fabp7 is expressed in radial glia and immature astrocytes in the brain [ 28 - 30].	"radial glia	73	84	Cell"	"astrocytes	98	108	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""radial glia"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""astrocytes"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Given the expression pattern elsewhere in the nervous system, it is possible that Fabp7 is up - regulated in M u ller glia in the rd7 retina in response to injury in a manner akin to the novel M u ller glial gene identified in this study, RIKEN cDNA 4933409K07 ( Figure 1, gene G47).

Interestingly, they showed that this homolog appears to have a pan - photoreceptor pattern of expression early in development that later resolves into a rod - specific pattern of expression.

This early expression in cones may represent a mechanism whereby the expression of cone - specific gene products is temporarily repressed.

Since virtually all M - opsin - expressing cells are localized at the outer edge of the ONL by P28 in the rd7 mutant ( Figure S8), any increase in M - opsin transcript in the mutant must have occurred in cells in that location.	"cells	43	48	Cell"	"cells	204	209	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 204, ""end_span"": 209, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
A variety of novel cone - specific or cone - enriched genes were characterized in this study.	"cone	19	23	Cell"	"cone	38	42	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
A third gene involved in glucose metabolism, hexokinase 2 ( Hk2), is also derepressed in the rd7 mutant and shows a pattern of expression in the wild - type retina, suggesting greater expression in cones than in rods ( see Figure 1; Table S1).	"cones	198	203	Cell"	"rods	212	216	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cones"", ""start_span"": 198, ""end_span"": 203, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""rods"", ""start_span"": 212, ""end_span"": 216, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Furthermore, prior studies have suggested differences in glycogen and glucose metabolism between primate rods and cones [ 35].	"rods	105	109	Cell"	"cones	114	119	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rods"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cones"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
It is known that Nr2e3 is expressed only in rods, and the transcript is first detectable in postmitotic cells ( J. Trimarchi and CLC, unpublished data).	"rods	44	48	Cell"	"cells	104	109	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rods"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
One test of the hypothesis that there are two temporally distinct rod precursor populations would be to carry out birthdating experiments to determine whether the supernumerary S - opsin - positive cells in the rd7 retina derived exclusively from an early - or late - born population.	"rod	66	69	Cell"	"cells	198	203	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 198, ""end_span"": 203, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In this way, a subset of cells from an initially homogeneous population would select the S - cone fate in an entirely probabilistic manner.	"cells	25	30	Cell"	"cone	93	97	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
It is also unlikely that we would fail to detect an ESCS - like ERG signal in mice if it were present, as such a signal has been demonstrated in the Nrl mutant mouse, which has a near total transformation of all its rods into blue cones [ 24].	"rods	216	220	Cell"	"cones	231	236	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rods"", ""start_span"": 216, ""end_span"": 220, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cones"", ""start_span"": 231, ""end_span"": 236, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In the present study we found the mouse crumbs ortholog to be up - regulated in the rd7 mutant retina by microarray, consistent with its higher expression level in cones than in rods [ 50].	"cones	164	169	Cell"	"rods	178	182	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cones"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 169, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""rods"", ""start_span"": 178, ""end_span"": 182, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
One further point worthy of note is the striking similarity between the hybrid photoreceptor identified in this study and a naturally occurring photoreceptor found in ground squirrels.	"photoreceptor	79	92	Cell"	"photoreceptor	144	157	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
"Although these unusual findings have been difficult to interpret under the usual assumptions of "" duplicity theory "" [ 56], we would like to suggest that ground squirrels may have experienced a naturally occurring down - regulation or loss of Nr2e3 expression in their "" rods "" that transformed them into a hybrid photoreceptor cell type."	"rods	271	275	Cell"	"photoreceptor cell	314	332	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rods"", ""start_span"": 271, ""end_span"": 275, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""photoreceptor cell"", ""start_span"": 314, ""end_span"": 332, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

In order to quantitate only the area of those cell bodies that were cut as near to the midline of the cell as possible ( i. e., in order to obtain the maximal cross - sectional area) the five cells with the largest apparent area in each photograph were chosen by eye and the outline of the cell membranes were traced onto white paper.

Recent cell culture studies with MSUD cells have suggested that the thiamin - responsive phenotype is dependent upon the presence of at least one E2 expressing allele [ 45, 46].

To investigate the role of this protein during mouse development, we generated a conditionally deleted allele of the Atrx gene in mouse embryonic stem ( ES) cells, and used these cells to examine the effect of ablating expression of the full - length Atrx protein in ES cells and in mouse embryos.	"cells	157	162	Cell"	"cells	179	184	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 162, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 179, ""end_span"": 184, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We investigated directly the effect of Atrx on ES cell growth by comparing Atrx + and Atrxnull ES cell clones in competition cultures.

The clone containing the Atrx Delta 18 Delta neo allele was rapidly outgrown by both AtrxWT ES cells and cells bearing the Atrxflox allele.

Thus, although Atrxnull ES cells could be recovered and maintained in culture by a conditional targeting approach, these cocultivation experiments suggested that the absence of Atrx does negatively impact upon normal ES cell growth.	"cells	27	32	Cell"	"cell	220	224	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 220, ""end_span"": 224, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Using methylation - sensitive restriction enzymes, we also observed significant hypomethylation at several sites tested within the mouse rDNA repeats in Atrxnull ES cells and 12 - d embryoid bodies relative to ES cells and embryoid bodies bearing a functional Atrx allele ( AtrxWT or Atrxflox) ( Figure 3B and 3C).	"cells	165	170	Cell"	"cells	213	218	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 170, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 213, ""end_span"": 218, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
However, consistent with our observation of a grossly normal apoptotic index in Atrxnull ES cells ( Figure S2), the apoptotic response observed in Atrxnull embryos was also not uniform, but was restricted to a low number of scattered TUNEL - positive cells.	"cells	92	97	Cell"	"cells	251	256	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 251, ""end_span"": 256, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Although a growth defect was also observed in Atrxnull ES cells ( Figure 3A), in contrast to the Atrxnull embryos, the mitotic index of the ES cell population ( as measured with the same antibody) was not depleted ( Figure S1B).	"cells	58	63	Cell"	"cell	143	147	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 147, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The number of Pl - 1 - expressing cells attached to the decidual wall after removal of the embryo is an indication of the density of trophoblast cells surrounding each implantation site [ 17].	"cells	34	39	Cell"	"trophoblast cells	133	150	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""trophoblast cells"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Most blastocysts hatched from the zona pellucida within 24 h, and trophoblast cells spreading out from the inner cell mass could usually be detected within 48 h of culture.

In contrast, the epiblast region of carrier female embryos was composed of a mosaic of small clusters of Atrx - positive cells ( in which the Atrxnull allele on Xm had been inactivated) and Atrx - negative cells ( in which the AtrxWT allele on Xp had been inactivated), indicating that the Atrx gene was subject to normal random X - inactivation in the epiblast.	"cells	121	126	Cell"	"cells	206	211	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 206, ""end_span"": 211, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This is consistent with our observation that Atrx is highly expressed in ES cells, and that the absence of full - length Atrx imparts a growth disadvantage relative to cells bearing a functional Atrx allele.	"cells	76	81	Cell"	"cells	168	173	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 168, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
However, our observations in ES cells demonstrate that the induction of apoptosis is not an automatic response triggered by the removal of Atrx in all cell types, and suggest that the inappropriate apoptosis observed in the Atrx - mutant forebrain may reflect a requirement for Atrx during terminal differentiation.	"cells	32	37	Cell"	"cell	151	155	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 151, ""end_span"": 155, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
TGCs are highly differentiated, postmitotic cells that ultimately form an epithelial layer at the periphery of the placenta, which interfaces with the maternal cells of the decidua [ 23].

Further evidence that Atrx is also required at later stages of mouse development is provided by the observed dramatic skewing against Atrx - negative cells in some somatic tissues of carrier female mice, whose tissues initially comprise a mosaic of Atrx - positive and Atrx - negative cells as a result of random X - inactivation ( M. Muers, personal communication).	"cells	150	155	Cell"	"cells	285	290	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 155, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 285, ""end_span"": 290, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Atrx - mutant embryos progress further than embryos nullizygous for factors involved in the initial specification of trophoblast stem cells ( such as Cdx2) or in stem cell maintenance and proliferation ( such as Eomes).	"trophoblast stem cells	117	139	Cell"	"stem cell	162	171	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""trophoblast stem cells"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""stem cell"", ""start_span"": 162, ""end_span"": 171, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Thus, unlike Atrx, these genes and / or their effects on cell growth are unable to circumvent the processes that ultimately cause all cells in the extraembryonic tissues to express only the maternally derived X chromosome.

Another possible mechanism is that inactivation of the paternal X proceeds normally in all cells, but subsequently the Atrx gene within individual cells is reactivated.

The K14 promoter is a commonly used epidermal cell promoter because of its expression by the mitotically active cells of the epidermis and its appendages in mature skin [ 18], but most notably it is active in embryonic ectoderm as early as the single layered ectodermal stage of embryonic day ( E) 9. 5 [ 19].

These elevated beta - catenin - expressing cells were usually surrounded by proliferating cells, forming bulb - like structures.

Comparison of immunochemically stained serial sections showed that these intense cytosolic beta - catenin stainings were usually found in either K14 - positive K1 - negative basal epidermis or K14 - positive K6 - negative basal ORS cells, and are surrounded by proliferating cells.

There were numerous neutrophils and macrophages infiltrating the thymus in response to these keratins; hence, these structures could be called pyogranuloma.

The diffuse expression of beta - catenin was also present in these epithelial cells, and at this age fewer cells were positive for nuclear beta - catenin staining ( Figure 6N).

As in the younger mutant mice, however, nuclear localization of beta - catenin was only observed in K14 - negative cells that looked like undifferentiated basal cells.

In contrast, in our model, K14 - cre - mediated deletion of Apc would result in Apc mutation not only in K14 promoter active cells, but remain so in all cell layers that derived from the K14 promoter active progenitors.

This indicates that despite the absence of Apc and potential stabilization of beta - catenin in derivatives of K14 - expressing progenitors, elevated beta - catenin expression, and subsequent cell fate determination may only take place in basal cells.

It is unclear when K14 - cre induction actually takes place in the mutant thymus, but as the population of cells showing a strong nuclear beta - catenin staining as well as the cells expressing K14 were small and thymic epithelial compartments still existed in a mild P3 mutant thymus ( Figure 6E and 6F), it seems that initial differentiation to medullary and cortical TECs and thymocyte colonization have already taken place prior to the major effects of K14 - driven Apc loss.

The linearized targeting vectors were electroporated into 129 / S - derived ES cells, WW6 cells [ 15].
