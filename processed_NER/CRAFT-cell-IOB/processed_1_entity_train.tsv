Glaucoma involves retinal ganglion cell death and optic nerve damage that is often associated with elevated intraocular pressure ( IOP) [ 1 - 5].	"retinal ganglion cell	18	39	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""retinal ganglion cell"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

Cells lacking BRCA1 / 2 fail to form damage - induced subnuclear RAD51 foci with normal efficiency, suggesting that these proteins are required for the formation of recombinase complexes at the sites of DNA damage [ 20, 21].

The similarity between phenotypes associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2 deficiency, together with data showing a similar effect of DNA damage on distribution of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in repair - proficient cells, led to the hypothesis that BRCA2, like BRCA1, is required for efficient recombinational repair.

Moynahan et al [ 24] have used such a GFP recombination substrate to demonstrate that cells with defective BRCA2 protein are deficient in their ability to repair the I - SceI - induced DSB through homologous recombination.	"cells	86	91	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
CAPAN - 1 cells carry a deletion of BRCA2 on one homolog and codes for a protein truncated at amino acid 1981 on the other homolog.	"cells	10	15	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The authors indicate that the level of I - SceI - induced recombination in CAPAN - 1 is over 100 - fold less than that seen using other ( BRCA2 +) human tumor cell lines.	"cell	159	163	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 163, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The different lines examined, however, are very likely to differ genetically from CAPAN - 1 cells not only at the BRCA2 locus, but also at a very large number of additional loci.	"cells	92	97	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
While Moynahan et al were careful to point out this problem, two sets of results argue against the possibility that the recombinational repair deficiency of CAPAN - 1 cells is completely independent of its defect in BRCA2.	"cells	167	172	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 167, ""end_span"": 172, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
First, in the same study [ 24], recombination in a mouse ES cell line that expresses only truncated BRCA2 protein was measured.	"cell	60	64	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This line was found to have lower recombination efficiency than isogenic cells expressing full - length BRCA2 ( the defect observed was about fivefold to sixfold).	"cells	73	78	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Furthermore, the discrepancy between the 100 - fold difference between CAPAN - 1 and the other human lines as compared with the fivefold to sixfold difference between the Brca2lex1 / lex2cells and Brca2 + / + ES cells might simply be accounted for by the fact that Brca2lex1 / lex2 is not a null allele.

It had been shown previously that the small amount of truncated BRCA2 protein expressed by CAPAN - 1 cells was mislocalized to the cytoplasm, consistent with the fact that the truncation protein lacks a nuclear localization signal [ 28].	"cells	101	106	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Davies et al showed CAPAN - 1 cells to be defective in nuclear localization of RAD51, raising the possibility that RAD51 is normally carried to the nucleus by binding BRCA2.	"cells	30	35	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In a BRCA2 - defective cell, mutant Rad51 becomes associated with DNA at random sites and is therefore not readily recruited to sites of damage.	"cell	23	27	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

Since we were unable to obtain ES cells, embryos or mice with widespread expression of a RFP ( DsRed1) we conclude that this reporter is not developmentally neutral or that its expression cannot be sustained at levels high enough for detection, and as such is not as versatile as other gene - based fluorescent reporters.

Only a few undifferentiated hair cells were detected by MyoVIIa immunostaining and only in the basal region of the cochlea.	"hair cells	28	38	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""hair cells"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This does not exclude the possibility that even less differentiated hair cells may form in the apex.	"hair cells	68	78	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""hair cells"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Qualitative comparable central projections are found in wildtype control littermates ( data not shown) and suggest that the central projection to cochlear nuclei is at least until P8 in mice not critically dependent on auditory information or other hair cell - mediated influences, in agreement with recent suggestions [ 5, 19].	"hair cell	249	258	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""hair cell"", ""start_span"": 249, ""end_span"": 258, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
These data suggest that a crude cochleotopic projection can form independently of any signaling from the immature hair cells of the cochlea.	"hair cells	114	124	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""hair cells"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Notably, there are still a number of fibers extending from the very few vestibular sensory neurons to the canal epithelia, in particular the horizontal canal ( Fig. 7a, 7b).	"sensory neurons	83	98	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""sensory neurons"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Comparable to control mice, there is some transcellular labeling with DiI to cells apparently contacted by the afferent fibers in the Brn3c null mutant utricle ( Fig. 7b).	"cells	77	82	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Transcellular labeling with DiI ( b) suggest contacts between these afferents and immature hair cells.	"hair cells	91	101	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""hair cells"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
However, spiral sensory neurons are present in Rosenthal ' s canal ( c, d) and fibers extend to the organ of Corti where they form longitudinal tracts in the immature epithelium.	"sensory neurons	16	31	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""sensory neurons"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Only an occasional fiber extends beyond the inner spiral bundle into the area of the outer hair cells ( Fig. 7d).	"outer hair cells	85	101	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""outer hair cells"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Even at this late stage in maturation there are still numerous spiral neurons present in the apex ( Fig. 7c, 7d).	"neurons	70	77	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In summary, these tracing data suggest that mature hair cells are not necessary to direct fiber outgrowth and to maintain some fibers at least up to 6 months in the apex of the cochlea.	"hair cells	51	61	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""hair cells"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This signal was very strong over hair cells of the P0 control animals ( Fig. 8b).	"hair cells	33	43	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""hair cells"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In contrast, only a faint signal was detected in the Brn3c null mutant ( Fig. 8a) and the few silver grains were located predominantly over the area of the immature hair cells.	"hair cells	165	175	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""hair cells"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 175, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The BDNF signal in the utricle was clearly centered on the hair cells in the control animal but some aggregation of silver grains appeared also in the Brn3c null mutants ( data not shown).	"hair cells	59	69	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""hair cells"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Note the limited expression of BDNF in the basal turn of both wildtype and mutant littermates ( a, b) and the much stronger expression of NT - 3 in the apex over the region of the inner hair cells in both wildtype and control littermates ( c, d).	"inner hair cells	180	196	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""inner hair cells"", ""start_span"": 180, ""end_span"": 196, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
NT - 3 expression persists at least until P8 in the apex of Brn3c null mice in an area that topologically compares to the inner hair cells of control animals ( e, f, arrows).

Immature hair cells and limited expression of neurotrophins rescue afferent projection until P8	"hair cells	9	19	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""hair cells"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The neurotrophins have long been implicated as the mediators for target mediated cell death.	"cell	81	85	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In essence, this theory of regulation of neuronal connections via neurotrophic support implies that only limited quantities of neurotrophins are released by the target tissue to support only properly connected sensory neurons by providing only these with a critical amount of neurotrophins [ 21].	"sensory neurons	210	225	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""sensory neurons"", ""start_span"": 210, ""end_span"": 225, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
For example, in BDNF heterozygotic animals there is a small decrease in the number of sensory neurons in the ear [ 13] but no change in the overall pattern of innervation.	"sensory neurons	86	101	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""sensory neurons"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In contrast, Brn3c is barely expressed during embryogenesis in the CNS [ 22] thus arguing that the survival of ear primary neurons depends crucially on the periphery.	"primary neurons	115	130	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""primary neurons"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We suggest that limited expression of neurotrophins in the immature target leads to retention of primary neurons and their afferent fibers in newborn and early postnatal Brn3c null mice.	"primary neurons	97	112	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""primary neurons"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The comparatively high level of NT - 3 expression in Brn3c null mutant cochlea, which has been shown to be the neurotrophin most prominently supporting spiral sensory neurons [ 6, 9, 14], is in agreement with the normal development of cochlear innervation in newborn Brn3c null mutants.	"sensory neurons	159	174	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""sensory neurons"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In fact, in the cochlea of embryos and neonates as well as in the saccule and utricle of embryos, NT - 3 is predominantly expressed in supporting cells [ 6].	"supporting cells	135	151	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""supporting cells"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Past work has shown that BDNF and NT - 3 appear to shift in their expression into inner hair cells around birth or are lost in the ear and other parts of the nervous system [ 6, 10, 20, 23].	"inner hair cells	82	98	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""inner hair cells"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Thus the factor ( s) cannot be released by differentiated hair cells but there is an unexplored possibility of generalized expression of neurotrophins at low levels in the undifferentiated epithelia.	"hair cells	58	68	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""hair cells"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This would work only in cases in which the loss of primary neurons would not already be completed long before birth as is the case in the ear [ 6, 13].	"primary neurons	51	66	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""primary neurons"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Comparable long term retention of apical spiral sensory neurons was described for the deaf white cat [ 25] and may also be the case in humans with congenital deafness.	"sensory neurons	48	63	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""sensory neurons"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Growth of fibers to the cochlea does not require mature hair cells	"hair cells	56	66	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""hair cells"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This does not preclude that even less differentiated hair cell precursors may form in the apex or that those precursors have died before birth.	"hair cell	53	62	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""hair cell"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Interestingly, the growth to outer hair cells is most affected in Brn3c null mutant cochleae.	"outer hair cells	29	45	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""outer hair cells"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Instead of extending radially through the tunnel of Corti to outer hair cells, afferents appear to stall and extend in longitudinal directions as inner spiral bundles ( Figs. 3, 7).	"outer hair cells	61	77	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""outer hair cells"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The formation of supporting cells also appears to depend on the proper expression of various bHLH factors such as Hes 1 and 5 which appear to be regulated by the Notch signaling pathway [ 17, 28, 29].	"supporting cells	17	33	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""supporting cells"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Probing for the proper expression of supporting cell specific markers in Brn3c null mutants is necessary to further evaluate these suggestions.	"supporting cell	37	52	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""supporting cell"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Previous work has suggested that efferent fibers, derived from facial branchial motoneurons, follow afferents and for that reason reflect in detail all connectional deviations of afferents [ 16, 30 - 32].

Our data on Brn3c null mouse mutants nevertheless suggest that the high to low frequency progressive hearing loss in humans may correlate with the unknown factor ( s) that mediate apical spiral neuron survival into adulthood.	"neuron	194	200	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neuron"", ""start_span"": 194, ""end_span"": 200, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Quantitative data on human Pou4f3 cochleae is needed to verify that spiral neuron loss is more pronounced in the basal, high frequency area of these hearing - deficient patients.	"neuron	75	81	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neuron"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Null mutants of ear specific neurotrophins have completed the loss of sensory neurons before birth.	"sensory neurons	70	85	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""sensory neurons"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This late sensory neuron loss is likely not related to known neurotrophin signaling which becomes reduced in neonatal wildtype animals.	"sensory neuron	10	24	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""sensory neuron"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The long term retention of afferents in the cochlear apex in the absence of any apparent differentiation of hair cells raises hopes for cochlear implants in deaf - born children.	"hair cells	108	118	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""hair cells"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Similar long term retention of apical afferents exists in the deaf white cat [ 25] and should be explored in other model systems with embryonic and neonatal hair cell loss [ 37, 38].	"hair cell	157	166	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""hair cell"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 166, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Immunostaining of P7 cochlear whole mounts using the hair cell specific - myosin VII ( MyoVIIa) antibody was performed as previously described [ 2].	"hair cell	53	62	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""hair cell"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Images of labeled organs of Corti were then acquired using a SPOT digital camera ( Diagnostic Instruments Inc.) and the number of hair cells was scored from acquired images.	"hair cells	130	140	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""hair cells"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
MX generated the null mutation, bred all the mice used for this study and generated the statistical data and the immunocytochemical data with MyoVII, AM conducted the tract tracing studies of cochlear afferents and helped with the histological analysis and assembly of image plates, UP carried out the in situ hybridization for neurotrophins and assembled the plates for these data, BF wrote the manuscript, carried out most of the neuronal tracing and immunocytochemistry for acetylated tubulin and data presentation.

Salzer et al. recently reported the presence of the 47 kDa isoform of annexin A7 and its partner sorcin in micro - and nanovesicles derived from red blood cells where they are located in the lumen and are also enriched in membrane rafts [ 7].

In western blots of human red blood cells the 47 and 51 kDa isoforms were detected using mAb 203 - 217 ( Fig. 1).	"red blood cells	26	41	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""red blood cells"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
To examine this, we analysed the ability of red blood cells derived from the annexin A7 knock out mice ( anxA7 - / -) to form exovesicles.	"red blood cells	44	59	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""red blood cells"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The quantity of both vesicle types did not differ between wild type and knock out red blood cell vesicles as determined by the AChE - values ( A405 nanovesicles: ~ 0. 18; A405 microvesicles: ~ 0. 9; both, for wt and ko).

Similarly, the high abundance of annexin A7 in micro - and nanovesicles might be fortuitous as a significant percentage of the red blood cell membrane, with which annexin A7 associates when the Ca2 + levels rise, appears to be involved in the formation of exovesicles.

Membrane cholesterol diminishes red blood cell haemolysis by the complement complex, whereas depletion of raft cholesterol abrogates association of all raft proteins with no significant effect on areas in the rest of the cell membrane and deformability [ 45, 46].

Nevertheless it might interact with other components and have a role in organizing the membrane cytoskeleton, controlling raft protein associations or influencing the ionic strength of red blood cells on its own or by interfering with other signaling pathways.

It has been demonstrated that micromolar changes of the intracellular Ca2 + concentration exert a profound effect on the membrane properties that regulate red blood cell deformability [ 48, 49].

They are also not essential for the formation of specific membrane domains such as lipid rafts, as exogenously added recombinant annexin A7 redistributed to similar positions in a density gradient containing membranes derived from red blood cells of anxA7 - / - mice.

Our finding that different olfactory receptors have different expression levels is intriguing given the one - neuron, one - gene expression regime of olfactory receptors.	"neuron	110	116	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neuron"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Subsequent studies have shown that some of these receptors do indeed respond to odorants and can confer that responsivity when expressed in heterologous cell types ( for example [ 4]).	"cell	153	157	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
A small subset of olfactory receptors appears to be expressed in non - olfactory tissues, principally the testis [ 8], but also taste tissues [ 9], prostate [ 10], erythroid cells [ 11], notochord [ 12] and perhaps other tissues.

Each olfactory receptor is expressed in a subset of cells in one of four zones of the epithelium [ 14, 15].	"cells	52	57	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Furthermore, each olfactory neuron expresses only one allele [ 16] of a single olfactory receptor gene [ 17, 18], and the remaining approximately 1, 499 genes are transcriptionally inactive.

In a third model, there would be a limiting quantity of transcription factors - the cell might contain a single transcriptional ' machine ' that is capable of accommodating the promoter of only one olfactory receptor gene, similar to the expression site body used by African trypanosomes to ensure singular expression of only one set of variant surface glycoprotein genes [ 22].

In situ hybridization ( Figure 4) shows that increased numbers of expressing cells account for some, but not all, of the difference in transcript levels between two of the genes tested by real - time PCR ( genes A and D in Figure 3).

The expression pattern of gene D does not correspond to any of the four ' classical ' olfactory epithelial zones [ 14, 15, 32]: positive cells are found in regions of endoturbinates II and III and ectoturbinate 3, resembling the expression pattern seen previously for the OR37 subfamily and ORZ6 olfactory receptors [ 33, 34] ( Figure 4b).

It is known that each olfactory receptor is expressed in one of four zones of the olfactory epithelium [ 14, 15]; do some zones choose from a smaller olfactory receptor sub - repertoire and thus express each olfactory receptor in a larger number of cells?

Although many fewer pseudogenes than intact genes were represented in our cDNA collection, some neurons in the olfactory epithelium evidently express disrupted olfactory receptors and thus might be unable to respond to odorants or to correctly innervate the olfactory bulb.

In preparation for immunostaining, cells were blocked with 2% goat serum in PBS for 30 minutes, then incubated with 1: 50 dilution of primary antibody anti - Abcg5 in 2% goat serum - PBS for 1. 5 hours, and subsequently incubated with secondary rhodamine anti - rabbit IgG antibody for 30 minutes.

In acute transfection studies, the SC antibody recognized over - expressed mouse Abcg5 / sterolin - 1 in COS - 1 cells, but not mouse Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 ( Figure 6b, 6c).	"cells	113	118	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Serial sections of intestinal tissue were incubated with anti - Abcg5 / sterolin - 1 to determine the cellular location of Abcg5 / sterolin - 1.	"cellular	102	110	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cellular"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The pattern of staining of Abcg5 / sterolin - 1 in the intestinal sections is clearly apical and localized to the villi of the enterocytes ( Figure 6g, 6h, 6i).	"enterocytes	127	138	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""enterocytes"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
It has been shown that Abcg8 / sterolin - 2 expression is required for correct apical trafficking of Abcg5 / sterolin - 1 to the apical surface in a polarized cell line and more recently in vivo by over - expression experiments [ 18, 19].

Endolymph volume in Slc26a4 - / - mice was increased and tissue masses in areas normally occupied by type I and II fibrocytes were reduced.	"fibrocytes	115	125	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""fibrocytes"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The mouse strain 129Sv / Ev ( Taconic, Germantown, NY) was chosen as the source of Slc26a4 + / + controls, since Slc26a4 - / - mice were propagated in the this strain and generated using a stem cell line derived from 129Sv / Ev.

Interestingly, sensory hair cells in the cochlea appear normal until postnatal day ( PD) 7 but show clear evidence of degeneration by PD 15 [ 14].	"hair cells	23	33	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""hair cells"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
These observations suggest that the cochlear environment supports the survival of sensory hair cells in spite of the enlargement of the endolymphatic duct.	"hair cells	90	100	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""hair cells"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
A normal endolymphatic K + concentration, which is critical for hair cell survival [ 20], is established at PD 3 [ 21] and may persist in Slc26a4 - / - at least until PD 7.	"hair cell	64	73	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""hair cell"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Degeneration of hair cells is probably a response to the loss of the endocochlear potential.	"hair cells	16	26	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""hair cells"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Marginal cells of stria vascularis, which form the barrier toward endolymph, transport K + from the intrastrial space into endolymph and keep the K + concentration low adjacent to the KCNJ10 K + channel [ 26].

Intermediate cells of stria vascularis were visualized by their pigmentation.	"cells	13	18	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Pigmentation was present in stria vascularis of Slc26a4 - / - mice ( Fig. 2b), which suggests that intermediate cells are present.	"cells	112	117	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The presence of KCNJ10 mRNA in stria vascularis of Slc26a4 - / - mice supports the finding that intermediate cells are present.	"cells	109	114	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Expression of KCNJ10 in Slc26a4 - / - mice was absent in stria vascularis but unchanged in spiral ganglion cells.	"cells	107	112	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The absence of a change in tissue height is consistent with the presence of intermediate cells [ 28].	"cells	89	94	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Further, we observed an apparent loss of tissue masses in areas that are normally occupied primarily by type I and II fibrocytes.	"fibrocytes	118	128	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""fibrocytes"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In addition, we observed an apparent degeneration of stria vascularis, including an increase in pigmentation and an irregular pattern of the tight junctions of marginal cells ( Fig. 2c, 6, 7).

ZO - 1 and F - actin expression revealed a continuous layer of basal cells, including a junction of basal cells with surface epithelial cells in Slc26a4 - / - mice, as observed in normal mice ( Fig. 1c, 1d, 1e, 1f, 6, 7).	"basal cells	63	74	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""basal cells"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

The rate of K + secretion necessary to maintain endolymphatic K + concentration, however, may be less than necessary in Slc26a4 + / + mice given the reduced numbers of sensory hair cells, which provide a major pathway for K + exit from endolymph [ 30, 31].

The ~ 45 kDa cathepsin D band, representing precursor, was the predominant band in wild - type ( wt) tissue and cellular extracts, with lower levels of mature enzyme ( single chain, ~ 43 kDa, and heavy chain, ~ 31 kDa).	"cellular	112	120	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cellular"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Thus, cathepsin D transport and processing are disrupted in homozygous CbCln3 Delta ex7 / 8 cells in a manner such that enzymatic activity appears to be relatively unaffected.	"cells	92	97	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

The abnormal transport and processing of cathepsin D suggested membrane trafficking disruptions in homozygous CbCln3 Delta ex7 / 8 cells; therefore, we surveyed the subcellular distribution and morphology of membrane organelles.	"cells	131	136	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
However, Lamp 1 and Lamp 2 total protein levels were similar in wild - type and homozygous CbCln3 Delta ex7 / 8 cells by immunoblot analysis, indicating the altered signal likely reflects dispersed lysosomes or altered localization and / or epitope availability ( data not shown).

Lysotracker and Lamp 2 labeling of wild - type and homozygous CbCln3 Delta ex7 / 8 lysosomes Lysosomal labeling of wild - type and homozygous CbCln3 Delta ex7 / 8 precursor cells with lysotracker and Lamp 2 antibody is shown.	"cells	173	178	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 173, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Lysotracker dye ( top panels) labeled large, perinuclear - clustered lysosomes and scattered lysosomes in the periphery of wild - type cells ( CbCln3 + / +).	"cells	135	140	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Lysotracker stain was dramatically reduced in homozygous mutant cells ( CbCln3 Delta ex7 / 8 / Delta ex7 / 8), with smaller labeled vesicles and less apparent perinuclear clustering.	"cells	64	69	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Lamp 2 ( bottom panels) immunostaining also showed reduced signal intensity with less perinuclear clustering in homozygous CbCln3 Delta ex7 / 8 cells, although the effect was somewhat less dramatic than that observed with Lysotracker dye.

Consistent with the altered early endosome marker ( EEA1) signal observed by immunostaining ( Fig. 3), fluid - phase endocytosis was also altered in homozygous CbCln3 Delta ex7 / 8 cells, as measured by dextran - FITC uptake ( Fig. 7).	"cells	181	186	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 181, ""end_span"": 186, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Following a 15 - minute incubation in media containing dextran - FITC, wild - type and heterozygote cells displayed brightly stained, large endocytic vesicles that were clustered in the perinuclear region.

In wild - type ( CbCln3 + / +, left panel) and heterozygous ( CbCln3 + / Delta ex7 / 8, middle panel) cells, dextran - FITC label was observed in a perinuclear - clustered vesicular pattern with scattered labeled vesicles also present in the periphery.	"cells	102	107	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In contrast, dextran - FITC label of homozygous mutant ( CbCln3 Delta ex7 / 8 / Delta ex7 / 8, right panel) cells was reduced overall and exhibited smaller stained vesicles with less perinuclear clustering.	"cells	108	113	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Finally, because subunit c is a mitochondrial protein and its turnover proceeds through autophagic engulfment of mitochondria [ 13], we analyzed homozygous CbCln3 Delta ex7 / 8 cell mitochondrial morphology and function.

Importantly, these defects are likely to be early events in the JNCL disease process and may particularly impact neuronal function.	"neuronal	113	121	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Abnormal cathepsin D localization and processing in homozygous CbCln3 Delta ex7 / 8 cells and Cln3 Delta ex7 / 8 mice likely reflects altered vesicular trafficking and / or lysosomal pH, which is known to impact cathepsin D processing [ 14, 16].	"cells	84	89	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Indeed, CLN3 overexpression in HEK - 293 cells altered lysosomal pH and cathepsin D processing [ 17], and lysosomal pH homeostasis is disrupted in JNCL [ 10, 15].	"cells	41	46	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Nevertheless, despite the cathepsin D protein alterations that are observed in homozygous CbCln3 Delta ex7 / 8 cells, cathepsin D enzymatic activity does not appear to be reduced.	"cells	111	116	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Aging of homozygous CbCln3 Delta ex7 / 8 cells at confluency is necessary to induce significantly accumulated subunit c protein.	"cells	41	46	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
However, membrane organelle disruptions precede subunit c accumulation in homozygous CbCln3 Delta ex7 / 8 cells, since they are observed without aging at confluency.	"cells	106	111	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Battenin immunostaining in homozygous CbCln3 Delta ex7 / 8 neuronal precursors is significantly reduced in abundance, but mutant signal also co - localizes with endosomal markers suggesting mutant battenin protein with C - terminal epitopes is trafficked similar to wild - type protein.	"neuronal	59	67	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Neurotransmission heavily relies on membrane vesicle transport, and a high - energy metabolism may further sensitize neurons to the loss of battenin activity.	"neurons	117	124	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

In a common theme of organogenesis, certain cells within a multipotent epithelial sheet exchange signals with their neighbors and develop into a bud structure.	"cells	44	49	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
These studies provide insights into how multipotent cells within a sheet are stimulated to undergo transcriptional changes that result in proliferation, junctional remodeling, and bud formation.	"cells	52	57	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Mammalian development involves the morphogenesis of complex three - dimensional structures from seemingly uniform sheets or masses of cells.	"cells	134	139	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The multipotent, adhering epithelial cells are typically attached to an underlying basal lamina that polarizes the epithelial sheet and separates it from surrounding mesenchyme.	"epithelial cells	26	42	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""epithelial cells"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
At the helm of these molecular communication pathways are Wnts, bone morphogenic proteins ( BMPs), transforming growth factor beta s ( TGF - beta s), and fibroblast growth factors ( FGFs).

However, the process appears to be patterned at the initial stages of bud formation, since the relative importance of these pathways and their downstream effectors differ as buds begin to develop and cell fates are specified.	"cell	200	204	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 200, ""end_span"": 204, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The development of a bud requires a number of coordinated changes in the behavior of the targeted cells within an epithelial sheet.	"cells	98	103	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The process must be accompanied by alterations in the proliferation, polarity, shape, and adhesiveness of selected cells, as well as by modifications in their underlying basal lamina.	"cells	115	120	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

Although the temporal spike of Snail in the hair bud is reflected at the mRNA level and seems to follow Wnt signaling and BMP inhibition, LEF - 1 / beta - catenin activation does not appear to induce Snail gene expression in embryonic skin keratinocytes.	"keratinocytes	240	253	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""keratinocytes"", ""start_span"": 240, ""end_span"": 253, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Our studies point to the view that Snail likely functions downstream of cell fate specification, at a stage where the bud begins to exhibit enhanced proliferation and migration.	"cell	72	76	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Given our prior observation that exogenously added Snail can participate with LEF - 1 / beta - catenin in down - regulating E - cadherin expression in keratinocytes [ 4], coupled with the established requirement for LEF - 1 / beta - catenin in hair follicle morphogenesis [ 4, 19], we turned to addressing whether Snail / Slug family members might also participate in the process.

As judged by immunohistochemistry, Snail protein was localized to the nuclei of the hair bud cells ( Figure 1E).	"cells	93	98	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

Aberrant staining was also observed with antibodies against components of the hemidesmosomes, which provide strong adhesion of basal epidermal cells to the underlying basal lamina ( Figure 3M and 3N).	"basal epidermal cells	127	148	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""basal epidermal cells"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
To distinguish between these possibilities, we tested whether alpha - catenin levels could be restored by exogenous expression of E - cadherin in Snail - expressing keratinocytes.	"keratinocytes	165	178	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""keratinocytes"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 178, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
As shown in Figure 4C, transiently transfected keratinocytes expressing HA - tagged Snail displayed a loss of E - cadherin and alpha - catenin at cell - cell borders.	"keratinocytes	47	60	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""keratinocytes"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Numerous studies have correlated a down - regulation of E - cadherin with a translocation of beta - catenin to the nucleus and a transactivation of genes that are regulated by the LEF - 1 / T cell factor ( TCF) family of DNA binding proteins [ 23, 24, 25].

Indeed, when serum - starved keratinocytes were transiently transfected with an Ajuba expression vector, the levels of pMAPK were not only elevated but also comparable to those transfected with the K14 - HASnail transgene ( Figure 4F).

A variety of extracellular signals have an impact on the cell type - specific expression of different Snail family members, and many of them, including Wnts, BMPs, FGFs, and TGF - beta s, also affect hair bud development [ 2, 16, 28].

Previously, we showed that effective transmission of a Wnt - 3a signal in cultured keratinocytes can be achieved through their exposure to the BMP inhibitor noggin, which induces LEF - 1 expression [ 4].

Thus, despite essential roles for Wnts and noggin in hair follicle specification [ 4, 29, 30], our studies did not support an essential role for these signals in governing Snail expression in keratinocytes.

Thus, we turned towards addressing whether TGF - beta 2 might be involved in regulating Snail expression in keratinocytes isolated from the basal layer of the epidermis.	"keratinocytes	108	121	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""keratinocytes"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Interestingly, treatment of cultured keratinocytes with as little as 5 ng / ml of TGF - beta 2 caused a rapid and transient induction of Snail ( Figure 5B).	"keratinocytes	37	50	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""keratinocytes"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The rapid kinetics of Snail expression were reflected at the mRNA level, suggesting that Snail promoter activity in keratinocytes might be sensitive to TGF - beta 2 signaling ( Figure 5C).

Thereafter, Snail promoter activity rapidly returned to the basal levels seen in unstimulated keratinocytes.	"keratinocytes	94	107	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""keratinocytes"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Taken together, these results suggested that in keratinocytes, TGF - beta 2 signaling results in a pSMAD2 - dependent transient activation of the Snail gene, and that maintenance of Snail protein relies, in part, upon sustained promoter activity.	"keratinocytes	48	61	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""keratinocytes"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The brevity of Snail gene and protein induction in TGF - beta 2 treated cultured keratinocytes resembled the temporal appearance of Snail mRNA and protein at the initiation of hair follicle morphogenesis in embryonic mouse skin.	"keratinocytes	81	94	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""keratinocytes"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Consistent with this notion, basement membrane remodeling still took place in the TGF - beta 2 - null buds, as judged by immunofluorescence with antibodies against beta 4 integrin, an integral component of keratinocyte - mediated adhesion to its underlying basement membrane ( Figure 6F).	"keratinocyte	206	218	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""keratinocyte"", ""start_span"": 206, ""end_span"": 218, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
During budding morphogenesis, intersecting signaling networks from the epithelium and mesenchyme govern transcriptional, adhesive, polarity, and motility programs in these select groups of cells.

Our finding that TGF - beta 2 is upstream from Ki67 expression and MAPK activation lends further support to the notion that hair follicle keratinocytes at this early stage of development react to TGF - beta 2 signaling in a fashion opposite to that typically expected for TGF - beta factors.	"keratinocytes	138	151	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""keratinocytes"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
One obvious factor is the K14 promoter, which is elevated in the basal layer of the epidermis and the outer root sheath ( ORS) of the hair follicle, but is markedly down - regulated in developing embryonic hair buds as well as in the postnatal hair progenitor cells.	"cells	260	265	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 260, ""end_span"": 265, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Previously, we discovered that early during hair follicle morphogenesis, E - cadherin gene expression is down - regulated concomitantly with the invagination of developing bud cells into the skin [ 4].	"cells	176	181	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 176, ""end_span"": 181, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This prompted an investigation that subsequently led to our discovery that LEF - 1 / beta - catenin can contribute to repression of E - cadherin gene expression in skin keratinocytes [ 4].	"keratinocytes	169	182	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""keratinocytes"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 182, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In the course of these studies, we also noted that Snail can also contribute to this process in keratinocytes in vitro, and our present studies revealed that Snail is expressed at the right place and time to be physiologically relevant in the process.	"keratinocytes	96	109	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""keratinocytes"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The marked epidermal hyperproliferation seen in the K14 - Snail Tg skin, coupled with the converse suppression of proliferation and Snail in TGF - beta 2 - null hair buds led us to wonder whether the down - regulation of E - cadherin during follicle morphogenesis might have a direct impact on elevating the proliferative state of these cells.	"cells	337	342	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 337, ""end_span"": 342, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The corresponding abilities of either Snail - transfected or Ajuba - transfected keratinocytes to exhibit elevated activation of the Ras - MAPK pathway suggest that the Grb - 2 association of Ajuba under conditions of reduced levels of AJ proteins may be directly relevant to the parallel in hyperproliferation.

In stable epithelial ( i. e., Madin - Darby canine kidney, or MDCK) cell lines, Snail has been shown to block cell cycle progression and promote motility and shape changes for invasion [ 47].	"cell	68	72	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
A priori, this could be simply due to variations in the response of different cell types to Snail expression.	"cell	78	82	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Alternatively, these differences may be relevant to the benefit of using mouse models to reveal functions not always recapitulated in stable cell line models.	"cell	141	145	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This said, by identifying the status of different players involved in specific cell types and at specific stages in development, our mechanistic understanding of how intercellular remodeling is linked to proliferation in epithelial morphogenesis should begin to surface in the future.

Two processes from horizontal cells were situated on either side of the synaptic ridge ( Figure 8B, labelled H) and one or more dendrites of rod bipolar cells occupied a central position ( Figure 8B, bipolar labelled B).

In the OPL of Crx - / - retinas, photoreceptor terminals were highly disorganized at P21 ( Figure 7B, arrows).	"photoreceptor	33	46	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
( A) In Crx + / + retina at P21, newly formed rod spherules were abundant ( arrow demonstrates one example).	"rod	46	49	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Cone terminals form large, flat pedicles that contain many invaginating synapses with separate ribbon structures.	"Cone	0	4	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Cone"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 4, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
( B) In the outer plexiform layer ( OPL) of Crx - / - retinas, photoreceptor terminals appeared highly disorganized at P21 ( arrows).	"photoreceptor	63	76	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
( A) Crx + / + rod spherules contained a single invaginating synapse with one ribbon complex.	"rod	15	18	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
( B) Crx + / + rod terminals contained a single ribbon structure ( r).	"rod	15	18	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
( C) In the OPL of Crx - / - retinas, photoreceptor terminals appeared highly disorganized.	"photoreceptor	38	51	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In this study, an ultrastructural analysis of Crx - / - photoreceptors was carried out.	"photoreceptors	56	70	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptors"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Two prominent pathologies were characterized in the Crx - / - retina: ( 1) An absolute block in outer segment morphogenesis was noted, with the block occuring at the elongation stage of outer segment formation; ( 2) Crx - / - photoreceptors exhibited a severe perturbation in synapse formation.	"photoreceptors	226	240	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptors"", ""start_span"": 226, ""end_span"": 240, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Crx - / - photoreceptors cannot complete outer segment morphogenesis	"photoreceptors	10	24	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptors"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The deficits in peripherin - / - and Crx - / - photoreceptor morphogenesis were found to be very similar.	"photoreceptor	47	60	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Vesicular structures in Crx - / - photoreceptors were observed that were similar to those previously noted in the rds / peripherin - / - mouse.	"photoreceptors	34	48	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptors"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
It was initially proposed that these vesicles were due to the breakdown of outer segment membranes that were not properly recruited to the outer segments in the absence of peripherin, or were from the result of the breakdown of the microvilli of M u ller cells [ 30].	"M u ller cells	246	260	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""M u ller cells"", ""start_span"": 246, ""end_span"": 260, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In developing photoreceptors, an extraordinary growth process occurs whereby the outer segment is generated from the nascent connecting cilium ( see [ 38] and references therein).	"photoreceptors	14	28	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptors"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Transgenic mice with variable levels of expression of wild type rhodopsin exhibit rod degeneration [ 41], indicating the importance of the level of rhodopsin expression.	"rod	82	85	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In Drosophila, rhodopsin ( ninaE) is expressed in photoreceptors R1 - R6.	"photoreceptors R1 - R6	50	72	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptors R1 - R6"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In ninaE null mutants, the rhabdomere, a structure analogous to vertebrate outer segments, fails to develop in R1 - R6 photoreceptors [ 42], reminiscent of the situation in rhodopsin - / - mice [ 29].	"R1 - R6 photoreceptors	111	133	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""R1 - R6 photoreceptors"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This result is consistent with observations in the rat wherein rhodopsin onset occurs with strict timing in the developmental history of most rods in vivo [ 44].	"rods	142	146	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rods"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Interestingly, in one hypomorphic allele of Drosophila otd, otduvi, photoreceptor morphogenesis is also disrupted [ 45].	"photoreceptor	68	81	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Those that are expressed at a lower level in the Crx - / - retina, such as rhodopsin and peripherin, comprise many that are either enriched or specific to photoreceptors in their expression [ 35].	"photoreceptors	155	169	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptors"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 169, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Finally, polarization of photoreceptors was found to be largely intact, as was ciliogenesis.	"photoreceptors	25	39	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptors"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The Drosophila homologue of CRB1, Crumbs, has been implicated in photoreceptor morphogenesis [ 47].	"photoreceptor	65	78	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
However, the spontaneously occurring mouse mutant in CRB1, the Rd8 mouse, develops shortened outer segments that subsequently degenerate [ 48], suggesting that photoreceptor polarization and synaptogenesis are intact in this mutant.	"photoreceptor	160	173	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 160, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Synaptogenesis is perturbed in Crx - / - photoreceptors	"photoreceptors	41	55	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptors"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The Crx - / - mouse demonstrates the most severe abnormality of photoreceptor synapses reported to date.	"photoreceptor	64	77	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
These observations demonstrate that photoreceptor synaptogenesis can occur in the absence of outer segment formation.	"photoreceptor	36	49	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In keeping with this observation is the fact that some electroretinogram activity is present in peripherin - / - mice, suggesting that minimal phototransduction is present in these mice, enough to drive activity at the photoreceptor synapse.	"photoreceptor	219	232	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 219, ""end_span"": 232, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In vitro studies wherein synapse elements are formed in the absence of proper outer segment development and, therefore, possible absence of light - dependent photoreceptor activity, have indicated the independence of phototransduction and synapse formation, at least for the initial stages [ 50, 51].	"photoreceptor	158	171	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 158, ""end_span"": 171, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
These data then suggest that the fact that the Crx - / - photoreceptors do not have proper synaptic endings is not due to a lack of outer segment formation.	"photoreceptors	57	71	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptors"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
A more likely explanation is that Crx plays a role in photoreceptor synapse formation, perhaps by regulating directly, or indirectly, important genes in this process.	"photoreceptor	54	67	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Tags from three genes from proteins expressed in photoreceptor terminals were found to be decreased in a statistically significant fashion, namely the HGF - regulated tyrosine kinase substrate, the CRIPT protein, and synaptotagmin 1 ( Blackshaw and Cepko, unpublished data).	"photoreceptor	49	62	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Abnormal photoreceptor terminal formation was noted in a study that examined retinal development in the laminin beta2 chain - deficient mouse [ 52].	"photoreceptor	9	22	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Also photoreceptor terminals were perturbed in laminin beta2 mutants, but again the phenotype was more subtle then that of Crx - / - mice.	"photoreceptor	5	18	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The mechanistic relationship of these two molecules, if any, in photoreceptor morphogenesis is unknown to date.	"photoreceptor	64	77	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The majority of known genes responsible for human genetic blindness, encode proteins expressed almost exclusively, or exclusively, in photoreceptors, particularly in the outer segment [ 35].

Mutations in Crx were the first, and still one of a very few examples of a transcription factor mutation leading to photoreceptor disease.	"photoreceptor	116	129	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
LCA is a disease in which there is little or no photoreceptor function in infancy; thereby, likely developmental in etiology ( [ 17, 56] for review).	"photoreceptor	48	61	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In addition, they claim in the text to have seen aberrant synaptic and inner retinal organization, although their examination of photoreceptor synapses unfortunately are not presented in the data section of the paper.

Recent evidence points toward a transcriptional coactivator, peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - gamma ( PPAR gamma) coactivator - 1 alpha ( PGC - 1 alpha), as an integrator of the molecular regulatory circuitry involved in the transcriptional control of cellular energy metabolism, including mitochondrial function and biogenesis [ 1, 2].	"cellular	266	274	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cellular"", ""start_span"": 266, ""end_span"": 274, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
PGC - 1 alpha serves as a direct transcriptional coactivator of nuclear and nonnuclear receptor transcription factors involved in cellular energy metabolism [ 6].	"cellular	130	138	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cellular"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Second, forced expression studies in adipogenic and myogenic mammalian cell lines demonstrated that PGC - 1 alpha activates mitochondrial biogenesis through a group of transcription factor targets including nuclear respiratory factors 1 and 2 ( NRF - 1 and - 2) and mitochondrial transcription factor A ( Tfam), key transcriptional regulators of mitochondrial DNA transcription and replication [ 8].	"cell	71	75	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Third, studies in primary cardiac myocytes in culture and in the hearts of transgenic mice have demonstrated that overexpression of PGC - 1 alpha promotes mitochondrial biogenesis [ 10, 16].	"cardiac myocytes	26	42	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cardiac myocytes"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
PGC - 1 alpha protein was not detected in whole cell ( Figure 1E) or nuclear protein extracts ( unpublished data) isolated from BAT of PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice under basal conditions or in response to cold exposure, a condition known to markedly induce the expression of PGC - 1 alpha in BAT.	"cell	48	52	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
There were no obvious abnormalities in cellularity, cell size, or extracellular matrix in the tissues of 1 - 2 - mo - old PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice ( unpublished data).	"cell	39	43	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Quantitative morphometry of the electron micrographs confirmed that the cellular volume density of soleus mitochondria was significantly lower in PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice compared to PGC - 1 alpha + / + controls independent of changes in the myofibrillar component ( Figure 3B).

To further investigate the mechanisms involved in the fasting - induced hepatic steatotic response, hepatocytes were isolated from PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice and WT controls.	"hepatocytes	100	111	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""hepatocytes"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Surprisingly, the hepatic expression of PPAR target genes involved in cellular fatty acid and oxidation ( MCPT and MCAD) were not significantly different between the genotypes under fed or fasted conditions ( Table 2).	"cellular	70	78	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cellular"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Next, we performed experiments to determine whether the reduced capacity for fat oxidation in the hepatocytes of the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice was related to altered mitochondrial respiratory function.	"hepatocytes	98	109	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""hepatocytes"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Compared to the WT controls, PGC - 1 alpha - / - hepatocytes exhibited a modest but significant reduction in both state 2 and state 3 respiration rates ( Figure 8C).	"hepatocytes	49	60	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""hepatocytes"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
To evaluate this possibility directly, rates of 3H - glycerol incorporation into TAG were determined in isolated hepatocytes.	"hepatocytes	113	124	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""hepatocytes"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Patchy areas of microvacuolation involving the neuropil and individual pyramidal neurons of the deep layers of the cerebral cortex were noted in the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice but not the PGC - 1 alpha + / + mice ( Figure 10A).	"pyramidal neurons	71	88	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""pyramidal neurons"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The hippocampus also showed neuronal microvacuolation, albeit to a lesser degree than the parietal cortex.	"neuronal	28	36	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Neither microglial proliferation nor perivascular lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrates were noted in the PGC - 1 alpha - / - CNS.	"lymphocytic	50	61	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""lymphocytic"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Ultrastructural examination of the PGC - 1 alpha - / - parietal cerebral cortex confirmed the presence of microvacuolated neurons and neuropil ( Figure 10B).	"neurons	122	129	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Vacuoles containing aggregates of membranous material were present in a subset of cortical neurons.	"neurons	91	98	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Subcellular localization of the vacuoles was difficult to establish; some may represent vacuolated elements of the neuropil, material in phagocytic cells, presynaptic nerve terminals compressing the soma, or genuine intraperikaryal deposits.	"phagocytic cells	137	153	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""phagocytic cells"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
However, several lines of evidence support the conclusion that PGC - 1 alpha is necessary for the programs that regulate postnatal mitochondrial function and cellular energy metabolism, processes that equip the organism for the energy metabolic rigors of the postnatal environment.	"cellular	158	166	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cellular"", ""start_span"": 158, ""end_span"": 166, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Following short - term starvation, we found that the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice developed marked hepatocyte triglyceride accumulation.	"hepatocyte	95	105	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""hepatocyte"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Further analysis revealed that palmitate oxidation rates were reduced in hepatocytes isolated from the PGC - 1 alpha - / - mice, which would predispose to lipid accumulation.	"hepatocytes	73	84	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""hepatocytes"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Surprisingly, the reduction in fatty acid oxidation rates in PGC - 1 alpha null hepatocytes was not due to altered expression of PGC - 1 alpha / PPAR target genes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation.	"hepatocytes	80	91	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""hepatocytes"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Indeed, the relative contribution of increased triglyceride synthesis rates to the steatotic phenotype cannot be fully discerned from our data, given that this response could reflect the direct effects of PGC - 1 alpha deficiency on target genes or a secondary compensatory response to hepatocyte fatty acid accumulation.

Alternatively, the normal process of cellular debris turnover could be altered due to a defect in the energetics of the microglial component of the central nervous system.	"cellular	37	45	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cellular"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Both PGC - 1 alpha - deficient lines exhibit cold intolerance, reduced hepatocyte respiration rates, and neurologic lesions.	"hepatocyte	71	81	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""hepatocyte"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

In particular, in the absence of Er81, achieved by mutation in the gene or by deprivation of peripheral neurotrophin signaling, group Ia proprioceptive afferents fail to invade the ventral spinal cord and to make effective synaptic connections with motor neurons [ 9, 14].

The involvement of target - derived signals in induction of ETS transcription factor expression raises the question of the necessity for the observed delay in the onset of ETS signaling for neuronal maturation.	"neuronal	190	198	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 190, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In this study, we have used mouse genetics to test this general idea, by investigating whether the precise timing of onset of ETS transcription factor signaling is essential for normal sensory neuron development.	"sensory neuron	185	199	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""sensory neuron"", ""start_span"": 185, ""end_span"": 199, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We find that within proprioceptive sensory neurons, the late onset of ETS signaling is essential for the establishment of normal sensory afferent projections in the spinal cord.	"sensory neurons	35	50	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""sensory neurons"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Our findings reveal that target - triggered inductive signals provide an effective means of ensuring the late onset of expression of transcription factors, and thus an orderly temporal transcriptional sequence that is crucial for neuronal maturation and circuit assembly.	"neuronal	230	238	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 230, ""end_span"": 238, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Er81 controls proprioceptive afferent connectivity [ 14], and we therefore sought to identify an ETS transcriptional regulator that, when expressed over the normal time course of Er81 expression, is able to substitute for Er81 function within group Ia afferent sensory neurons.	"afferent sensory neurons	252	276	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""afferent sensory neurons"", ""start_span"": 252, ""end_span"": 276, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
With this reference point, we then designed experiments to examine the effects of precocious post - mitotic expression of the same ETS transcription factor on sensory neuron differentiation.	"sensory neuron	159	173	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""sensory neuron"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We found that in a luciferase - enzyme - based cell culture transfection assay, EWS - Pea3 showed stronger transactivation activity than Er81 or Pea3 ( Figure 1J; data not shown), in agreement with previous studies [ 22, 23, 24].	"cell	47	51	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Expression of Er81 in DRG neurons of embryos containing integration of EWS - Pea3 in the Er81 locus ( Er81EWS - Pea3 / -) was abolished ( Figure 1E), and the expression level of the calcium - binding protein Parvalbumin ( PV) in proprioceptive afferents, which is decreased approximately 5 - to 10 - fold in Er81 mutants [ 14], was comparable to wild - type levels in Er81EWS - Pea3 / - embryos ( Figure 1F - 1H).	"neurons	26	33	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Er81EWS - Pea3 / - mice did not differ from wild - type in the number of proprioceptive afferent cell bodies within the DRG of L1 to L5, the expression of several genes normally expressed by proprioceptive afferents, and the lack of expression of genes not normally expressed in proprioceptive afferents ( Figure S1; data not shown).	"afferent cell	88	101	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""afferent cell"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In addition, to analyze axon ingrowth independent of the level of PV expression in DRG neurons, we used anterograde labeling of afferent fibers by applying fluorescently labeled dextran to cut dorsal roots ( Figure 2D - 2F).	"neurons	87	94	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We found no significant difference in the input amplitude to quadriceps motor neurons when comparing wild - type to Er81EWS - Pea3 / - mice ( Figure S2; wild - type, 10. 6 +/- 0. 9 mV, n = 11; Er81EWS - Pea3 / -, 10. 9 +/- 1 mV, n = 8).

To address the consequences of precocious ETS signaling for proprioceptive afferent differentiation, we next expressed EWS - Pea3 in DRG neurons as soon as they became post - mitotic.	"neurons	137	144	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Embryos positive for either Isl1Cre / + and TauEWS - Pea3 / + or Isl1Cre / + and TaumGFP / + alleles showed efficient activation of the silent Tau allele in 95% or more of all DRG neurons, including proprioceptive afferents, at all segmental levels ( Figure S3).	"neurons	180	187	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 180, ""end_span"": 187, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We next examined the establishment of peripheral projections upon precocious EWS - Pea3 expression in DRG neurons.	"neurons	106	113	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In summary, whereas isochronic expression of EWS - Pea3 promoted the establishment of proprioceptive afferent projections into the ventral spinal cord, precocious expression of the same ETS signaling factor in DRG neurons interfered with establishment of projections into the spinal cord as well as to peripheral targets.	"neurons	214	221	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 214, ""end_span"": 221, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
To begin to address the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the distinct biological actions of EWS - Pea3 at different developmental stages, we first turned to in vitro culture experiments.	"cellular	24	32	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cellular"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We cultured E13. 5 whole DRG explants from wild - type and TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos in the presence of NGF or NT - 3 or in the absence of neurotrophins and analyzed neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth on matrigel substrate after 48 h in vitro.	"neuronal	178	186	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 178, ""end_span"": 186, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Without neurotrophic support, very few wild - type DRG neurons survived ( Figure 4A).	"neurons	55	62	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In contrast, culturing wild - type DRG with neurotrophic factors led to neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth.	"neuronal	72	80	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Surprisingly, DRG neurons isolated from TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos and cultured without neurotrophic support survived after 48 h in vitro and had established long and highly branched neurites ( Figure 4D).	"neurons	18	25	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Neither the pattern of neurite outgrowth nor neuronal survival changed significantly after application of either NGF or NT - 3 ( Figure 4E and 4F).	"neuronal	45	53	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
To directly compare neurotrophin dependence of DRG neurons expressing EWS - Pea3 from the Tau locus at a precocious versus isochronic time of onset, we generated a strain of mice in which Cre recombinase is expressed from the PV locus ( Figure S4).	"neurons	51	58	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The expression of GFP in TaumGFP / + PVCre / + was restricted to PV + proprioceptive DRG neurons and mirrored the onset of expression of PV at approximately E14 ( Figure S4; data not shown).	"neurons	89	96	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We found that DRG neurons from both genotypes survived and extended neurites only in the presence of NT - 3, whereas they died in the absence of NT - 3 ( Figure 5).	"neurons	18	25	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Together, these findings suggest that only precocious but not isochronic ETS signaling in DRG neurons is capable of uncoupling survival and neurite outgrowth from a requirement for neurotrophin signaling normally observed in wild - type DRG.	"neurons	94	101	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Consistent with previous results, Bax - / - DRG neurons survived without neurotrophic support [ 28].	"neurons	48	55	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
To begin to assess at which step of the neurotrophin signaling cascade DRG neurons from TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos become unresponsive to the addition of neurotrophins, we assayed the expression of neurotrophin receptors in TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos ( Figure 6).	"neurons	75	82	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Whereas expression of the neurotrophin receptors TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC marks afferents of distinct sensory modalities in DRG of wild - type embryos ( Figure 6A - 6C) [ 4, 29], TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos showed complete absence of expression of TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC in DRG neurons at E16. 5 ( Figure 6G - 6I).	"neurons	282	289	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 282, ""end_span"": 289, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This absence of Trk receptor expression in DRG of TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos provides a likely explanation for the lack of responsiveness of these neurons to the addition of neurotrophic factors.	"neurons	158	165	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 158, ""end_span"": 165, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We next assayed whether the complete absence of Trk receptor expression in TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos had an influence on naturally occurring cell death in vivo using TUNEL on DRG sections.	"cell	153	157	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Quantitative analysis of the number of neurons in lumbar DRG of TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos revealed a significant increase to approximately 170% of wild - type levels ( Figure 6E, 6K, and 6N).	"neurons	39	46	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We found no significant quantitative changes in the level of Akt / p - Akt or CREB / p - CREB in DRG ( Figure 6O and 6P) both of which have been shown to be key regulators of neuronal survival [ 29].	"neuronal	175	183	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 183, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We first analyzed expression of TrkC, a gene downregulated in DRG neurons of TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos ( Figure 7A and 7B).	"neurons	66	73	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The level of expression of TrkC was indistinguishable from wild - type in DRG neurons of Er81EWS - Pea3 / - and TauEWS - Pea3 / + PVCre / + embryos ( Figure 7A, 7C, and 7D).	"neurons	78	85	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Moreover, PV was not expressed in DRG neurons of TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos ( Figure S5) but was expressed by proprioceptive afferents in both wild - type and Er81EWS - Pea3 / - embryos ( see Figures 1 and S5) [ 14].	"neurons	38	45	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We also found several genes that were ectopically upregulated in DRG neurons of TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos ( Figure 7).	"neurons	69	76	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Nevertheless, downregulation of Trk receptor expression or upregulation of Calretinin is restricted exclusively to neurons that have undergone recombination and cannot be observed in TaumGFP / + Hb9Cre / + embryos ( Figure 8).	"neurons	115	122	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Target - derived signals exhibit a conserved role in the induction of defined programs of transcription factor expression late in post - mitotic neuronal differentiation [ 10].	"neuronal	145	153	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This study provides evidence that the late onset of transcription factor expression is essential for many later aspects of neuronal differentiation and circuit formation.	"neuronal	123	131	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Our data indicate that DRG neurons undergo a temporal change in their competence to respond to ETS transcription factor signaling, as assessed by changes in gene expression and axonal target invasion ( Figure 9).	"neurons	27	34	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
One striking observation of this study is that precocious induction of ETS signaling promotes neuronal survival without a requirement for neurotrophic support and in complete absence of Trk receptor expression.	"neuronal	94	102	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In contrast, ETS signaling at the normal time of onset of Er81 expression does not result in enhanced neuronal survival in the absence of neurotrophins and also does not lead to downregulation of TrkC expression in proprioceptive afferents.	"neuronal	102	110	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
These findings demonstrate very distinct activities of one transcriptional regulator at different developmental steps within a committed post - mitotic neuronal lineage.	"neuronal	152	160	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 152, ""end_span"": 160, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In contrast, upon precocious induction of ETS signaling, we found more pronounced defects in the establishment of central rather than peripheral projections for all DRG neurons.	"neurons	169	176	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Induction of Er81 expression in proprioceptive afferents is controlled by peripheral NT - 3 as axons reach the vicinity of target muscles, and thus occurs only approximately 3 d after proprioceptive neurons become post - mitotic [ 9, 14].	"neurons	199	206	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 199, ""end_span"": 206, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Thus, both in Drosophila and vertebrates, target - derived factors appear to act permissively to induce the expression of transcriptional programs involved in terminal neuronal maturation.	"neuronal	168	176	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 168, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Our findings are compatible with a model in which DRG neurons acquire their mature fate by sequential and temporally controlled addition of lineage - specific features ( Figure 9).	"neurons	54	61	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Target - derived factors act on predetermined neuronal lineages to switch their developmental programs to become compatible with processes such as target invasion and branching.	"neuronal	46	54	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Such a transition state in the acquisition of a defined neuronal fate would be accompanied by the induction of appropriate transcriptional programs through the expression of specific transcription factors.	"neuronal	56	64	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The fusion of EWS with Pea3 could circumvent a need for activation through specific cofactors while still maintaining ETS site dependence, thus rendering EWS - Pea3 less sensitive to the cellular context than endogenous ETS transcription factors.	"cellular	187	195	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cellular"", ""start_span"": 187, ""end_span"": 195, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Using this fusion protein, our experiments demonstrate a profound change in the action of ETS signaling at the level of transcriptional regulation within post - mitotic DRG neurons over time.	"neurons	173	180	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 173, ""end_span"": 180, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Moreover, the observed transcriptional shift in ETS signaling is paired with the onset of appropriate regulation of neuronal subtype specification and establishment of axonal projections into the target area.	"neuronal	116	124	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
These findings thus also argue for a change in cellular competence to respond to a specific transcription factor over time albeit in an early precursor context.	"cellular	47	55	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cellular"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

Because no lesions were observed in the spinal cord ( Fig. 5F), it was suggested that Schwann cell specific myelination defect occurred in the homozygous mice.	"Schwann cell	86	98	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Schwann cell"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
To analyse the state of myelinating Schwann cells and axons, electron microscopic ( EM) analysis of the sciatic nerve was performed ( Fig. 6).	"Schwann cells	36	49	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Schwann cells"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

These results suggest that proliferation of the Schwann cells was not impaired but differentiation is severely delayed in the ADAM22 - deficient mice.	"Schwann cells	48	61	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Schwann cells"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Next, we performed RT - PCR analysis of mRNAs purified from several adult mouse tissues, such as the spinal cord, dorsal root ganglion ( DRG), sciatic nerve and cultured primary Schwann cells.	"Schwann cells	178	191	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Schwann cells"", ""start_span"": 178, ""end_span"": 191, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
For example, length of major amplified PCR fragments from the sciatic nerve ( Fig. 8A, lane 5) and cultured Schwann cells ( lane 6) were almost identical, and were shorter than those from other tissues.	"Schwann cells	108	121	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Schwann cells"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This RT - PCR analysis is summarized as follows: ADAM22 transcripts were roughly subdivided in 3 groups, CNS - form ( containing exon 27), DRG - form ( containing exon 27L) and Schwann - cell - form ( skipping exon 26 and 27).	"Schwann - cell	177	191	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Schwann - cell"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 191, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
From these results, we concluded that ADAM22 is expressed in a cell - type specific manner, and plays an essential role in myelinogenesis in the PNS.	"cell	63	67	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
For example, mice lacking the neuron - specific activator of cyclin 5, p35, exhibit seizures and a severe neuronal migration defect [ 23].	"neuronal	106	114	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
However, no marked abnormalities were observed in the mutant mouse brain, ruling out a critical role for ADAM22 in neuronal migration.	"neuronal	115	123	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
It was therefore evident that hypomyelinogenesis occurred specifically in the peripheral nerves in the knockout mice, suggesting Schwann cell dysfunction.	"Schwann cell	129	141	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Schwann cell"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In the mutant sciatic nerve, the density of pro - myelinating Schwann cells ( S100 - positive, MBP - negative) was markedly higher than that seen in heterozygotes.	"Schwann cells	62	75	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Schwann cells"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This is because several ADAMs have been shown to interact with integrins via disintegrin domains [ 9], and it has been suggested that alpha - 6 beta - 1 integrin on the Schwann cell plays an important role in myelin formation [ 25].

The conditional knockout studies of beta - 1 integrin and laminin gamma - 1 in Schwann cell suggested that both laminin - 2 and integrins are essential for segregation of large bundles of axons in the early stage of myelin formation [ 25, 28].

Some, if not all, bitter stimuli activate specific taste receptors, the T2Rs, which are expressed in subsets of taste receptor cells on the tongue and palate.	"taste receptor cells	112	132	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""taste receptor cells"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Furthermore, a number of physiological studies have suggested that the transduction of some amphiphilic bitter compounds, such as quinine and denatonium benzoate, may stimulate taste receptor cells independently of GPCRs ( e. g. [ 30]).	"taste receptor cells	177	197	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""taste receptor cells"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 197, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This region contains a number of known genes, all but eleven of which encode members of two large receptor families: natural killer cell lectin - like receptors, and T2R - type taste receptors.

Because of their proximity to the linked marker, their demonstrated expression in taste receptor cells, and their role in the detection of at least some bitter - tasting compounds, we hypothesized that one or more of the 24 Tas2rs at this locus were responsible for the major QHCl taste sensitivity QTL.	"taste receptor cells	82	102	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""taste receptor cells"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Tas2rs are the most likely candidates for the QHCl quantitative trait gene ( s) due to: ( 1) their expression in taste receptor cells and ( 2) genetic and functional evidence linking them to the detection of a number of bitter taste stimuli.	"taste receptor cells	113	133	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""taste receptor cells"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
As of yet there is no evidence for quinine activation of T2Rs from functional assays of these receptors in heterologous cells or membrane preparations, likely due to the lipophilic nature of quinine [ 23].	"cells	120	125	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
However, several physiological studies have suggested that quinine can directly activate G proteins or cationic conductances, or can block K + channels in taste receptor cells [ 34 - 36].	"taste receptor cells	155	175	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""taste receptor cells"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 175, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This tolerance may help to preserve the ability of T2R - expressing, bitter - sensitive taste cells to respond to a wide array of potentially toxic stimuli.	"taste cells	88	99	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""taste cells"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We propose that the interaction of PAX6 with HOMER3 and DNCL1 is a mechanism by which synaptic activation could lead to changes in neuronal transcriptional activity, and that some of the neural anomalies in patients with PAX6 mutations could be explained by impaired protein - protein interactions.

HOMER3 is found in the PSD of neurons and directly binds to type I metabotropic glutamate receptors, which act via phospholipase C to stimulate IP3 - mediated release of Ca2 + from intracellular vesicles [ 35, 39].

The amount and rate at which bone is gained during development and lost during aging are determined in large part by genetics [ 4 - 6] but also by physical activity and by alterations in the availability and response of bone cells to circulating hormones [ 7 - 9] and locally derived growth factors [ 10, 11].

"osteoclasts	32	43	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""osteoclasts"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
These findings suggest that the osteoclasts may not be the primary defect in Sam68 - / - mice, as they are in Src null mice [ 48].	"osteoclasts	32	43	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""osteoclasts"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Therefore, the loss of Sam68 could influence the bone marrow stromal cells to differentiate along the osteogenic versus the adipogenic pathway.	"stromal cells	61	74	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""stromal cells"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
To confirm a role for Sam68 in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation, we isolated primary MEFs from 14. 5 - day - old Sam68 + / + and Sam68 - / - embryos.	"adipocyte	49	58	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""adipocyte"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The primary Sam68 - / - MEFs were differentiated into adipocytes in vitro in culture medium containing 5 mu M pioglitazone to induce adipogenesis.	"adipocytes	54	64	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""adipocytes"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

Adipogenesis was more pronounced in the wild - type MEFs cultures than in the Sam68 - / - MEFs, consistent with the positive role of endogenous Sam68 in adipocyte differentiation ( Figure 7).

These data, together with data confirming a lean phenotype in Sam68 - / - mice ( N. Torabi and S.

The addition of BMP - 2 induced osteoblast differentiation, as evidenced by an approximately 400 - fold increase in expression of the osteocalcin ( OCN) gene [ 51].	"osteoblast	32	42	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""osteoblast"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

Given the apparent enhancement of mineralized nodule formation by Sam68 - / - bone marrow stromal cells ex vivo and the phenotype observed with short hairpin RNA ( shRNA) - treated C3H10T1 / 2, we stained sections of bone from 4 - and 12 - month - old mice for evidence of changes in marrow adiposity.

Figure 9 shows sections of undecalcified bone from 4 - and 12 - month - old Sam68 + / + and Sam68 - / - mice stained with von Kossa and toluidine blue to show mineralized tissue ( Figure 9A, black) and marrow adipocytes ( Figure 9B, white) and left unstained to show fluorochrome labeling of the mineralization fronts ( Figure 9C).

The present study provides evidence that a physiologic role of Sam68 is to modulate bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells.	"mesenchymal stem cells	96	118	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""mesenchymal stem cells"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
These findings demonstrate that the loss of Sam68 enhances osteoblast differentiation.	"osteoblast	59	69	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""osteoblast"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The converse was also true, as MEFs isolated from Sam68 - / - animals were impaired in their ability to undergo adipocyte differentiation compared with Sam68 + / + MEFs.	"adipocyte	112	121	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""adipocyte"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This expression pattern is consistent with previous work that has observed Sam68 in neurons [ 52] and as a substrate of the intestinal SIK / breast tumor kinase [ 43].	"neurons	84	91	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The documented role of the Sam68 regulatory protein, Src, in osteopetrosis led us to investigate the morphology and activity of Sam68 - / - osteoclasts ex vivo.	"osteoclasts	140	151	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""osteoclasts"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The Src tyrosine kinase was shown to play a role in bone remodeling when Src - / - mice died at 6 months of age with an osteopetrotic phenotype [ 48] and the defect was attributed to defective osteoclast function [ 55 - 59].	"osteoclast	193	203	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""osteoclast"", ""start_span"": 193, ""end_span"": 203, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We therefore cultured mature osteoclasts harvested from Sam68 + / + and Sam68 - / - mice ex vivo on dentin slices to quantify their resorptive capacity.	"osteoclasts	29	40	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""osteoclasts"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
However, this reduction in bone resorption occurred with normal osteoclast activity, as assessed by in vitro culturing.	"osteoclast	64	74	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""osteoclast"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
However, it is still possible, that a mild impairment in Sam68 - / - mice osteoclast function may manifest itself later in life in overall accumulation of bone and this will require further detailed studies.	"osteoclast	74	84	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""osteoclast"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
It will be important to demonstrate that a similar effect is observed using primary bone marrow stromal cells from aged Sam68 - / - mice.	"stromal cells	96	109	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""stromal cells"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
These findings identify Sam68 as the first RNA binding protein to regulate mesenchymal cell differentiation and the challenge will be to identify the specific RNA targets that it regulates during this process.	"mesenchymal cell	75	91	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""mesenchymal cell"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The fact that osteoblast function is altered in Src - / - mice [ 60, 61] raises the possibility that preservation of bone mass in the Sam68 - / - mice could be linked with and regulated by Src.	"osteoblast	14	24	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""osteoblast"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In conclusion, our data define a physiologic role for Sam68 in bone metabolism and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell differentiation.	"mesenchymal stem cell	95	116	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""mesenchymal stem cell"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Furthermore, the results also suggest that Sam68 expression levels, hypomorphism, and mutations in humans may influence susceptibility to marrow adipocyte accumulation and osteoporosis.

Some work has suggested isoform specific roles, such as a role for m - calpain in epidermal growth factor ( EGF) - induced cell motility [ 28, 29] and a role for mu - calpain in interferon - inducible protein 9 - induced migration of keratinocytes [ 28].

Capn4 - / - murine embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs) could be cultured from these embryos, although they also lacked calpain activity as assessed by casein zymography or by the formation of characteristic spectrin breakdown products, and they displayed migration defects consistent with a role for calpain in release of focal adhesions [ 9].

These options were narrowed down by the subsequent observation that Capn1 - / - mice, which lack the mu - calpain catalytic subunit, were healthy and fertile, although platelet aggregation and clot retraction defects were observed [ 33].

m - calpain was implicated in the acrosome reaction [ 47] which correlated with a translocation of m - calpain to the cortical membrane in oocytes where it might participate in the release of cortical granule contents required to prevent polyspermy [ 45].

It should also be stressed that Capn4 - / - ES and MEF cells from the presumptive hypomorphic allele can be maintained in culture despite an apparent lack of calpain activity, as assessed by casein zymography or by the appearance of characteristic spectrin breakdown products.

Consistent with the idea that cells in this primordium are poised between two developmental pathways, some of the genes that are involved in establishing sexual dimorphism, including Dax1 ( dosage - sensitive sex reversal - congenital adrenal hypoplasia critical region on the X chromosome protein 1), Sox9 ( Sry - like HMG box 9), Fgf9 ( fibroblast growth factor 9), and Wnt4 ( wingless - related MMTV integration site 4), are initially expressed in similar patterns in XX and XY gonads [ 3 - 8].	"cells	30	35	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The conventional view of mammalian sex determination is that the basic pathway of organ development is ovarian, and that the testis - determining gene operates by diverting this program toward testis development by simultaneously influencing the fate of the key supporting cell lineage and initiating a male - specific morphogenetic program.

Genetic evidence from chimeric mice [ 15], and expression studies using reporter transgenes [ 2, 16], indicate that Sry expression is required only in precursors of the somatic supporting cell lineage.

There is substantial evidence that a critical threshold number of Sertoli cells is required to establish testis differentiation [ 9, 15, 18 - 20].	"Sertoli cells	66	79	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Sertoli cells"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The first gene downstream of Sry known to show male - specific up - regulation in Sertoli cell precursors is a related gene expressed in many tissues in the developing embryo, Sox9.	"Sertoli cell	82	94	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Sertoli cell"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
However, expression of Sertoli cell markers was not previously detected in these mutants during fetal stages [ 8, 29], leading to the conclusion that Wnt4 was not involved in primary sex determination in the gonad.

To confirm this result, we examined agametic gonads from KitW / Wv compound heterozygous embryos, which develop testis cords containing Sertoli cells only.	"Sertoli cells	136	149	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Sertoli cells"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
However, the loss of SOX9 expression at 12. 5 dpc could be a consequence of the loss of Sertoli differentiation rather than a reflection of the genetic interaction between FGF9 and SOX9.	"Sertoli	88	95	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Sertoli"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Primary cell culture and gonad culture systems were used to assess Sox9 activation by exogenous FGF9.	"cell	8	12	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
To explain the difference between experimental results from dissociated XX gonadal cells and XX gonads, we reasoned that the local concentrations of FGF9 might not be high enough to override blocking signals in the intact XX gonad, or that active FGF9 was not efficiently localized or presented in the extracellular matrix of the XX gonad.	"cells	83	88	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Under these conditions, SOX9 expression was up - regulated locally in cells near the surface of the XX gonad in contact with the FGF9 bead ( Figure 2K).	"cells	70	75	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Taken together, these in vitro data demonstrate that ectopic FGF9 signaling can induce SOX9 expression in XX gonadal cells, suggesting a positive interaction between Fgf9 and Sox9.	"cells	117	122	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In wild - type and heterozygous mutant XY gonads at 11. 5 dpc, SOX9 was detected in a small number of cells in the gonad ( Figure 3A).	"cells	102	107	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Over the next 6 h of development, nuclear SOX9 accumulated rapidly in cells toward the cortex and the anterior and posterior poles of the gonad, replicating patterns previously reported for both Sry and Sox9 expression [ 2, 16, 34 - 36].

Somatic cells within Fgf9 - / - gonads were positive for SOX9 at 11. 5 dpc, the earliest stages examined, demonstrating that initial expression and up - regulation of SOX9 were not disrupted in Fgf9 - / - mutant XY gonads prior to 12. 0 dpc.

Because Sox9 acts as a positive regulator of Fgf9 expression, we questioned whether cell proliferation in XY gonads was also compromised by the loss of Sox9.	"cell	84	88	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

We examined two markers for Sertoli cell differentiation, anti - Mullerian hormone ( Amh) [ 38] and Desert hedgehog ( Dhh) [ 39] in Fgf9 - / - XY gonads using whole - mount in situ hybridization.	"Sertoli cell	28	40	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Sertoli cell"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
However, the absence of Dhh indicated that not all Sertoli pathways are initiated.	"Sertoli	51	58	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Sertoli"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The initial specification of Sertoli cell precursors was not affected by the loss of Fgf9, as evidenced by normal Sry and Sox9 expression in Fgf9 - / - gonads at 11. 5 dpc ( Figures 2 and 3D).	"Sertoli cell	29	41	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Sertoli cell"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
However, SOX9 expression in XY Fgf9 - / - gonads rapidly disappeared ( Figure 3E and 3F), and other Sertoli markers were absent or severely reduced ( Figure 4A - 4F).	"Sertoli	100	107	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Sertoli"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
These data suggested that the loss of SOX9 expression in Fgf9 - / - XY gonads was not caused by cell death but by the disruption of FGF9 / SOX9 feed - forward regulation.	"cell	96	100	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Wnt4 - / - XX gonads do not increase in size comparable to normal XY gonads ( Figure 6C, 6F, 6I, and 6L), and Sertoli cell differentiation and testis cord formation do not occur.	"Sertoli cell	110	122	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Sertoli cell"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We suggest that in the absence of the antagonizing activity of FGF9, WNT4 signals predominate and govern somatic cell fate in the gonadal field.	"cell	113	117	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

This occurs through the sex - specific regulation of WNT, FGF, and transforming growth factor beta signaling, which in turn regulate the growth, cell differentiation, and morphogenesis of the disk [ 41, 42].	"cell	145	149	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 149, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Other more recent studies have suggested that paracrine signals could be involved in the establishment of Sertoli cells [ 43 - 46].	"Sertoli cells	106	119	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Sertoli cells"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The current study reveals that ectopic FGF9 can induce SOX9 under conditions in which XX cells are dissociated ( Figure 2F), when an FGF9 - coated bead is directly applied to the XX gonad ( Figure 2K), or when the dose of Wnt4 is reduced ( Figure 5G).	"cells	89	94	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
[ 47] showed that misexpression of Fgf9 in chick nephrogenous mesenchyme led to the expansion of gonadal marker gene expression, implicating Fgf9 in gonadal cell proliferation across species.	"cell	157	161	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Antagonism of WNT signals may be a multistep process involving both the transcriptional down - regulation of Wnt4 observed in this study and the destabilization of downstream Wnt intracellular pathways that antagonize SOX9 expression, as shown in chondrocyte differentiation [ 49], or that compete for intracellular signal transducers as has been reported in other systems [ 50, 51].	"chondrocyte	247	258	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""chondrocyte"", ""start_span"": 247, ""end_span"": 258, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Such a role is not supported by efforts to misexpress Wnt4 in XY gonads, which have led to very mild phenotypes with no evidence for defects in Sertoli cell differentiation [ 54].	"Sertoli cell	144	156	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Sertoli cell"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
It is possible that WNT4 protein did not function as an active signal in these transgenic mice, either because it was not expressed in the right cells, at the right time, or at the right level.

Surprisingly, the fusion of GFP to p53 apparently altered p53 stability: steady - state levels of p53GFP were much higher than those of wild - type p53 ( p53WT) in unstressed cells, and did not vary significantly after DNA damage, so that the levels for both p53WT and p53GFP were similar after adriamycin treatment ( Figure 3A).

In addition, the combination of the C - terminal domains, RBD4 and CY ( of RanBP2), associates with a subset of G protein - coupled receptors, the red / green opsin, expressed in photosensory neurons and enhances opsin functional production [ 6, 7], while the interaction of the KBD of RanBP2 with a subset of the conventional microtubule - based motor proteins, the kinesins, KIF5B and KIF5C, occurs selectively in the central nervous system ( CNS) [ 13].

Finally, RanBP2 was also found to localize prominently to the mitochondria - rich ellipsoid subcellular compartment of photosensory neurons [ 19] and to RanGTPase - restricted foci along cytoplasmic tracks [ 19], in addition to its localization at cytoplasmic fibrils emanating from nuclear pores [ 2, 3, 10, 12, 19].

In this regard, it will be interesting to probe whether parkin also causes deficits in HKI in dopaminergic neurons, since parkin was reported to modulate RanBP2 turnover [ 20], and parkin loss - of - function also causes energy and growth deficits [ 26 - 29, 42].

Since the constitutive Na + / K + ATPase pump and the ATP - dependent conversion of glutamine to glutamate ( both fundamental to maintain the electrical activity in the CNS) consumes the vast majority of the energy produced by the CNS [ 45 - 47], this likely underlies the suppression of the electrophysiological output responses of retinal neurons ( Figure 8).

Therefore, we hypothesized that deletion of Alk5 in a specific cell lineage should reveal phenotypes which cannot be seen in comparable mutants lacking Tgfbr2.	"cell	63	67	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Indeed, we recently showed that neural crest cell specific Alk5 mutants display a unique spectrum of craniofacial developmental defects, e. g., cleft snout and severe mandibular hypoplasia [ 19]; these phenotypes were not seen in corresponding Tgfbr2 mutants [ 20].	"neural crest cell	32	49	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neural crest cell"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Our data further suggest that at least some of these abnormal detected phenotypes result from a dramatic increase in apoptosis of postmigratory cardiac neural crest cells.	"neural crest cells	152	170	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neural crest cells"", ""start_span"": 152, ""end_span"": 170, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
These phenotypes differ remarkably from those seen in corresponding Tgfbr2 mutants, suggesting that ALK5 mediates a wider spectrum of signaling events than its classical binding partner TGF beta RII in cardiac neural crest cells during cardiac and pharyngeal development.

To inactivate Alk5 in cardiac NCCs, mice homozygous for the floxed Alk5 allele ( Alk5Flox / Flox) [ 21] were crossed with transgenic Wnt1 - Cre mice [ 22], which were also heterozygous for the Alk5 knockout allele ( Alk5KO) allele.

The resulting mice heterozygous for the Alk5Flox and Alk5KO alleles, which also carried the Wnt1 - Cre transgene, had the Alk5 gene specifically inactivated in NCCs ( herein termed Alk5 / Wnt1 - Cre), while the littermates with remaining allelic combinations were phenotypically normal and served as controls ( Alk5Flox / +, Alk5KO / +; Wnt1 - Cre).

Similarly, serial transverse sectioning of whole mount embryos ( E10 - E12) and subsequent analysis of positively stained cells in the OFT region demonstrated that CNCCs deficient in Alk5 were capable of populating the PAAs, aortic sac and conotruncal ridges at a level comparable to that of controls ( Fig 4).

NC - derived cells around the abnomally bifurcated aortic sac, the abnormally large sixth PAAs and the truncus demonstrated strong alpha SMA staining ( Fig. 6H, J, L).	"cells	13	18	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
While CNCCs managed to migrate to the aortic sac and the truncal cushion level ( Fig. 6N, P, R), immunostaining for alpha SMA appeared much weaker when compared to controls and Alk5 mutants, implying that ALK2 - mediated signaling is involved in smooth muscle cell differentiation as previously suggested [ 12].

While CNCC proliferation was not affected in Alk5 mutants ( data not shown), we could detect a dramatic increase in the number of TUNEL positive cells in tissues surrounding the aortic sac including the site where the AP - septum forms ( Fig. 7A - C).	"cells	145	150	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 145, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In the chick, apoptotic neural crest - derived cells have also been found at the sites, where the prongs of the AP septum penetrate into the OFT cushion mesenchyme [ 25, 26].

Unlike in Alk5 / Wnt1 - Cre mutant embryos, increased apoptosis of NC - derived cells is not responsible for the observed defects in the OFT septation in corresponding Alk2 mutants ( Fig. 7C, E).

These data support a specific role for ALK5 signaling, either directly or indirectly, in CNCC survival, since a similar apoptosis of NC - derived cells is not seen in Tgfbr2 / Wnt1 - Cre mutants [ 8, 9].	"cells	146	151	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The fate determination assay demonstrated that the thymic primordia were equally populated by NCCs both in controls and Alk5 mutants ( Fig. 8B, E).	"NCCs	94	98	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""NCCs"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Serial sectioning revealed that the thymic primordia had failed to descend and were seen bilaterally in the upper pharyngeal region ( E, F) surrounded by neural crest derived mesenchyme ( blue staining cells in E).	"cells	202	207	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 202, ""end_span"": 207, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
During the last few years the Wnt1 - Cre transgenic driver line has proven to be a powerful tool for tissue - specific gene deletion in NCCs [ 12, 13, 27, 28].	"NCCs	136	140	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""NCCs"", ""start_span"": 136, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Although relevant Gdfs 8, 9 11 and 15 are not expressed in the developing heart, nor do the mice deficient in these Gdfs display developmental cardiac defects, we cannot exclude the possibility that circulating GDFs, perhaps in concert with TGF - beta s may contribute to NCC survival during cardiac and pharyngeal morphogenesis.	"NCC	272	275	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""NCC"", ""start_span"": 272, ""end_span"": 275, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Moreover, it has been suggested that deletion of Tgfbr2 in NCCs leads to other phenotypic features reminiscent of those seen in the velocardiofacial / DiGeorge syndrome ( VCF / DGS) [ 9] caused by a deletion of the so called DiGeorge critical region ( DGCR) on chromosome 22q11 [ 34, 35].	"NCCs	59	63	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""NCCs"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Firstly, while the pharyngeal organ migration fails in Alk5 / Wnt1 - Cre mutants, perhaps as a result of increased mesenchymal cell death in the pharyngeal region, both the thymus, thyroid and parathyroid seem to develop relatively normally on the histological level in these mutants.	"mesenchymal cell	115	131	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""mesenchymal cell"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
NCC ablation in the chick has been shown to lead to PTA and to a failure of addition of myocardium from the secondary heart field [ 40].	"NCC	0	3	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""NCC"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
It was suggested that the defective migration of cells from the secondary heart field to the OFT in turn resulted in shortening and inappropriate rotation of the OFT, leading to mal - alignment of the arterial pole with the ventricles [ 41].	"cells	49	54	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Since we could not detect appropriate rotation of the OFT in neural crest - specific mutants of Alk5 or Alk2, it appears that cells derived from the NC, as well as those from the SHF, are mutually required for proper OFT rotation in mice.	"cells	126	131	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In contrast, in Alk2 / Wnt1 - Cre mutants a sizeable septal mesenchyme could be seen, still without any obvious looping of the aortic sac and truncal OFT, suggesting that the mere presence of the septal mesenchyme, without correct smooth muscle cell differentiation, is not sufficient for OFT rotation.	"smooth muscle cell	231	249	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""smooth muscle cell"", ""start_span"": 231, ""end_span"": 249, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Our data suggest that ALK5 is required cell autonomously in the NC to mediate non - redundant signaling events that are essential for appropriate patterning of the pharyngeal organs and cardiac OFT.	"cell	39	43	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
However, because different members of this group often have similar effects on target cells and are produced in overlapping regions of the embryo and hence can be redundant with one another, removal of any single member of the BMP family may not reveal the full extent of the roles they play during development.	"cells	86	91	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
For example, during limb development, BMPs have been postulated to act sequentially in multiple distinct aspects of patterning, cell type specification, and differentiation of various tissues, particularly of the skeleton.	"cell	128	132	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
BMP activity also plays an indirect role in limb patterning as a key component of a feedback loop between SHH production in the posterior limb bud and fibroblast growth factor production in the overlying apical ectodermal ridge ( AER).	"fibroblast	151	161	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""fibroblast"", ""start_span"": 151, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This, in turn, prevents BMPs from downregulating fibroblast growth factor ( FGF) production in the AER [ 17, 22] and maintains the integrity of the AER itself [ 23].	"fibroblast	49	59	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""fibroblast"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
( Note that the strong acridine orange staining in Figure 2H is not in the interdigital mesenchyme but rather is in the remnant of the cells of the AER [ red asterisk].)	"cells	135	140	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The AER displays intense staining with acridine orange, TUNEL, or other markers for apoptosis at every stage when it is present, reflecting the rapid turnover of cells in this structure [ 33 - 35].	"cells	162	167	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 162, ""end_span"": 167, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
No significant difference was observed in the extent of apoptosis in the cells of the AER in earlier stage Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre mutant embryonic limbs ( Figure S1D - S1G).	"cells	73	78	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In contrast to the proposed roles for BMPs in anterior - posterior digit patterning, we obtained further support for the well - accepted idea that a threshold level of BMP signaling is necessary interdigitally for programmed cell death to occur.

As shown in Figure S1N and S1O, expression of Col II, a chondrocyte marker, is observed in the BMP2, BMP4 - deficient cartilage ( Figure S1O) as early as E12. 5, similar to a wild - type control ( Figure S1N).	"chondrocyte	56	67	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""chondrocyte"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The hypertrophic cells in BMP2, BMP4 - deficient limb also express late hypertrophic markers, such as osteopontin [ 42] ( unpublished data).	"cells	17	22	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Bone formation first occurs at the interface between the late hypertrophic chondrocytes and the surrounding perichondrium, a region identified as the bone collar.	"hypertrophic chondrocytes	62	87	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""hypertrophic chondrocytes"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Adjacent to the hypertrophic cells, a bone collar is laid down normally in the absence of BMP2 and BMP4 ( Figure 5A and 5B, red star).	"cells	29	34	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Osteoprogenitor cells from bone collar region now populate this site and deposit osteoid, forming the trabecular bone in the bone marrow cavity ( Figure 6E, red arrow) and cortical bone at birth ( Figure 5I, asterisk).	"Osteoprogenitor cells	0	21	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Osteoprogenitor cells"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
While vascularization occurs in Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre forelimbs, few osteoclasts are recruited to the mineralized cartilage ( compare Figure 5G and Figure 5H, red arrows), resulting in a delay in bone marrow cavity formation in the absence of BMP2 and BMP4.	"osteoclasts	80	91	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""osteoclasts"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
As shown in Figure 6A through 6E, in the control mice, a bone collar is found adjacent to the zone of late hypertrophic chondrocytes at 1 wk ( Figure 6A and 6B).	"hypertrophic chondrocytes	107	132	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""hypertrophic chondrocytes"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Many osteoblasts line the newly formed cortical bone in the diaphyseal region ( Figure 6C, blue arrow), and formation of a secondary ossification center has begun ( Figure 6A, red star).	"osteoblasts	5	16	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""osteoblasts"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Many osteoclasts have been recruited to the remaining mineralized cartilage and are actively resorbing this tissue ( red asterisks, Figure 6I), so that by 3 wks, all the mineralized cartilage in the diaphyseal region has disappeared, leaving a void where bone formation should have occurred ( Figure 6J, also see Figures 6L and S3).	"osteoclasts	5	16	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""osteoclasts"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The inability to complete osteoblast differentiation in the Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre mice results in strikingly defective limb morphology at 1 wk of age ( compare Figure S3G and S3H).	"osteoblast	26	36	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""osteoblast"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In the control mice, osteoblasts lining the surface of trabecular and cortical bone express type I collagen, runx2, and osterix genes at both 1 wk and 3 wks after birth ( Figure 7A - 7D and 7I - 7L).	"osteoblasts	21	32	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""osteoblasts"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The fact that this is variable, and limited to the 3 / 4 interdigit, implies that the threshold for induction of apoptosis is low enough that loss of BMP2, BMP4 or BMP7 or BMP2 and BMP7 still leaves sufficient BMP signaling for most interdigital cell death to occur normally.	"cell	246	250	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 246, ""end_span"": 250, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Thus, the expression of either BMP5, BMP6, and BMP7 ( in the absence of BMP2 and BMP4) or the expression of BMP4, BMP5, and BMP6 ( in the absence of BMP2 and BMP7) is sufficient to support mesenchymal condensation and chondrocyte differentiation in the developing limb.	"chondrocyte	218	229	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""chondrocyte"", ""start_span"": 218, ""end_span"": 229, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The phenotype we observe in limbs of Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre mice is similar to the phenotype reported for osterix knockout mice [ 46], which exhibited severe defects in osteoblastic differentiation.	"osteoblastic	179	191	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""osteoblastic"", ""start_span"": 179, ""end_span"": 191, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Once the complex between ligand and receptors is formed, BMP2, BMP4, BMP5, BMP6, and BMP7 direct the phosphorylation of the same set of BMP receptor - specific Smads ( 1, 5, or 8), and the signal that is transduced by each BMP appears to be identical in the skeletal target cells [ 48 - 51].	"cells	274	279	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 274, ""end_span"": 279, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
When this information is considered along with our observation that one allele of either Bmp2 or Bmp4 can rescue the osteoblast differentiation phenotype observed in Bmp2C / C; Bmp4C / C; Prx1:: cre mice ( see Figures 1I, 1J, 1Q, and 1R and S4), we favor the hypothesis that bone formation requires a threshold amount of BMP signaling which is not met when both BMP2 and BMP4 are completely absent.

gamma H2AX localizes to double - strand DNA breaks, so this staining may indicate that some diplotene mutant cells are approaching or entering apoptosis [ 59].	"cells	109	114	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

We did, however, observe three specific defects in the sex chromatin of Dmrt7 mutant germ cells that avoided arrest in pachynema and were able to enter diplonema.	"germ cells	85	95	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""germ cells"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Thus, although a minority of Dmrt7 mutant germ cells can progress from pachynema to diplonema, there are defects in sex chromatin modification during the transition.	"germ cells	42	52	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""germ cells"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Because most Dmrt7 mutant germ cells are eliminated by apoptosis around the time at which we observed sex chromatin defects, a simple model is that the apoptosis is a consequence of the sex chromatin defects.

However, because recombination is required for synapsis in mice ( mutations in recombination genes such as Dmc1 cause extensive asynapsis [ 16]), it has remained formally uncertain whether there is a distinct pachytene checkpoint that responds to defects in meiotic recombination, and if so, whether it would be identical to that used in somatic cells.

Recombination in Trip13Gt / Gt spermatocytes appeared to initiate normally as judged by the presence of gamma H2AX in leptonema ( Figure S2A and S2B), which reflects the presence of meiotically induced DSBs [ 18].

RAD51 and / or DMC1, components of early recombination nodules ( ERNs), was also present as abundant foci in Trip13Gt / Gt zygotene spermatocytes ( unpublished data; the anti - RAD51 antibody cross - reacts with DMC1), indicating that recombinational repair of DSBs is initiated.

Defects in DSB repair became apparent in pachynema upon probing of mutant spermatocyte nuclei with antibodies against molecules involved in various stages of recombination.	"spermatocyte	74	86	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""spermatocyte"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
For RAD51 / DMC1, mutant pachytene spermatocytes contained 138 +/- 6 foci ( compared to 11 +/- 3 foci in wild type, most of which were on the XY body), down from 218 +/- 13 in zygonema ( compared to 220 +/- 13 foci in wild type).	"spermatocytes	35	48	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""spermatocytes"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Consistent with the presence of rare ( < 1%) Trip13Gt / Gt pachytene spermatocytes devoid of persistent DNA repair markers, and testis histology showing some degree of postmeiotic progression ( Figure 3G), we observed both diplotene nuclei that lacked autosomal RAD51 / DMC1 and gamma H2AX ( Figure S3A - S3D), and also metaphase I spreads with 20 bivalents ( Figure S3E - S3F).	"spermatocytes	69	82	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""spermatocytes"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Since Trip13Gt may not be a complete null, these diplotene and metaphase I spermatocytes might arise by virtue of having sufficient wild - type TRIP13.	"spermatocytes	75	88	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""spermatocytes"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The persistence of BLM on Trip13Gt / Gt spermatocyte chromosomes suggests that at least a subset of the unrepaired DSBs correspond to sites of defective NCO recombinational repair.	"spermatocyte	40	52	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""spermatocyte"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Whereas all of the Dmc1 - / - spreads had ~ 35 or more condensed chromosomes, all of the + / + and Trip13Gt / Gt spreads had 20 - 25, suggesting that the MLH1 / 3 foci in Trip13Gt / Gt pachytene spermatocytes represent sites of completed, or near - completed, COs.

In mice, Spo11 - / - spermatocytes are severely defective in homologous chromosome synapsis [ 34, 35], and arrest with chromosomes in a state characteristic of the zygotene / pachytene transition ( Figure 3H).

Meiotic chromosomes of Rec8 mutant spermatocytes undergo apparent homolog pairing and interhomolog synaptic initiation, but are defective in DSB repair and fail to maintain interhomolog synapsis [ 39, 40].

Immunocytological analysis of spread chromosomes showed a failure of homologous chromosome synapsis in both the Rec8 - / - and Rec8 - / - Trip13Gt / Gt spermatocytes, as previously reported for Rec8 mutants ( Figure 5D and 5E) [ 39, 40].

Interestingly, RAD54 - deficient spermatocytes display abnormal persistence of RAD51 foci on pachytene chromosomes, similar to those in TRIP13 mice, but there are no deleterious effects on meiotic progression or fertility [ 49].

DSBs persist > 2 h longer in pch2 Delta yeast than in wild type, and hyperresection of DSBs in dmc1 Delta pch2 Delta double mutants is lower than in dmc1 Delta cells [ 10].	"cells	160	165	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 160, ""end_span"": 165, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Because synapsis occurs in TRIP13 - deficient spermatocytes and is dependent on DSB formation ( activity of SPO11 and MEI1), we suggest that TRIP13 functions after homology recognition and strand exchange, and that recombination events entering the CO repair pathway are either completed or nearly so ( because OA treated resulted in bivalent chromosomes).

Regarding the cause of cell death in Trip13 mutants, our data indicate that this is triggered by defective DSB repair rather than asynapsis.	"cell	23	27	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
It is possible that the nascent induction of DSBs in pachynema evokes a checkpoint response that cannot be bypassed by OA, whereas the post - strand invasion lesions in TRIP13 - deficient spermatocytes do not.

Interestingly, we observed that THRB is distributed diffusely throughout wild - type spermatocyte nuclei but is excluded from the XY ( sex) body ( unpublished observations), a compartmentalized nuclear domain beginning in pachynema, in which the sex chromosomes become heterochromatinized and transcriptionally silenced in the process of MSCI [ 55].
