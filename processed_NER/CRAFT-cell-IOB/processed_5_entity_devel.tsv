Finally, movement of pigment granules within melanocytes or from melanocytes to keratinocytes makes use of cellular machinery that is shared by a variety of cell types, but that can vary in different regions of the body ( reviewed in Marks and Seabra 2001).

Assuming that Nr2e3 acts cell autonomously, we can conclude that the supernumerary S - cone - positive cells and the hybrid photoreceptors identified in the rd7 retina were redirected to these fates from postmitotic cells that were destined to become rods.

Alternatively, the ratio of supernumerary S - cones to hybrid photoreceptors produced in the retina of ESCS patients might be such that a higher percentage of the presumptive rods in ESCS patients become S - cones rather than hybrid photoreceptors.

"The color coding of text in the column "" Gene Name "" is as follows: light blue ( G1 - G15), genes previously reported in the literature to have cone - specific or cone - enriched patterns of expression; yellow ( G16 - G25), novel cone genes identified in an unrelated study ( unpublished data); dark green ( G26 - G36), novel cone genes identified in the present study that were up - regulated in rd7; light green ( G37 - G46), additional genes found to be up - regulated in rd7 by microarray in the present study but that had either weak or inapparent cone - specific signal on in situ hybridization; white ( G47 - G53), additional genes up - regulated by microarray at two different timepoints but with either unusual expression patterns or nonconfirmatory in situ hybridizations."

With age, beta - catenin expression pattern became more diffuse and fewer epithelial cells showed nuclear localization but K8 + K14 + cells remained, forming concentric structures of epithelial cells filled with hard keratin deposits and infiltrated with vast number of neutrophils and macrophages.
