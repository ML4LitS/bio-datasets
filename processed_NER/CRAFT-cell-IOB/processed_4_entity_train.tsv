We will explore five points in this discussion: How the limited expression of neurotrophins relates to the apparent survival of primary neurons until P8; how the known absence of apical hair cells and of classical neurotrophins can be related to the presence of large numbers of apical turn spiral neurons; how absence of differentiated hair cells affects afferent and efferent targeting; and how these data possibly relate to other mutant animals and to children born with profound hearing loss.

Together, these results and the findings obtained from in vitro culture experiments ( see Figures 4 and 5) demonstrate that precocious or isochronic expression of EWS - Pea3 in the same neurons leads to significantly different cell - autonomous cellular responses with respect to gene expression, neuronal survival, and neurite outgrowth ( Figure 9).

The reduction in both osteoblast and osteoclast activity in the 12 - month - old Sam68 + / + mice argued against bone being lost primarily due to a relative increase in osteoclast over osteoblast activity, as seen in high turnover disease [ 49].

Research on calpains has linked them with a wide variety of functions including muscle growth, development, degeneration ( 3), neuronal growth and neurodegeneration [ 4], cell cycle progression [ 5, 6], signal cascades triggered by integrins and growth factors [ 7], membrane protrusion [ 8], remodeling of the cytoskeleton and cell migration [ 9 - 15], and regulation of cell death via both necrosis and apoptosis [ 16 - 22].

Sex - specific regulation of gonad organogenesis in vertebrates may occur in a similar manner, where some cells are cell - autonomously responsive to the sex - determining switch; however, the establishment of the male or female program occurs through the non - cell - autonomous activity of classic signaling pathways that act in an antagonistic manner and coordinate growth, cell differentiation and morphogenesis in the gonad.

In the wild - type adult testis, strongly staining TRA98 - positive cells form a layer one cell deep; however, in the mutant TRA98, strongly positive cells were abnormally organized, and some tubules had a layer several cells deep ( Figure 3A).

To characterize Sertoli cell differentiation, we examined expression of the Sertoli cell markers GATA4 ( a marker of immature postnatal Sertoli cells) and GATA1 ( a mature Sertoli cell marker).

In mice, both spermatocytes and oocytes harboring mutations that disrupt DSB repair ( such as Dmc1, Msh5, and Atm) are efficiently eliminated in pachynema, but spermatocytes are much more sensitive to DSB repair - independent synapsis defects than oocytes [ 13 - 15].

Expression in WT was most prominent in the nuclei of Type B spermatogonia ( Sg), leptotene spermatocytes ( LS), and early pachytene spermatocytes ( PS), but not late pachytene spermatocytes ( LP).
