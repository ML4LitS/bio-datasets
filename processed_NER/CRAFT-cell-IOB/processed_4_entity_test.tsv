This indicates that the mutant hematopoietic cells are not blocked prior to commitment to the erythroid lineage, but instead develop as abnormal erythroid cells and undergo apoptosis, similar to gata1 - deficient erythroid cells ( Fujiwara et al. 1996; Lyons et al. 2002).

A comprehensive investigation of apoptotic cell clearance in vivo and in vitro demonstrated that engulfment of apoptotic cells was normal in Ptdsr knockout mice, but Ptdsr - deficient macrophages were impaired in pro - and anti - inflammatory cytokine signaling after stimulation with apoptotic cells or with lipopolysaccharide.	"apoptotic cell	33	47	Cell"	"apoptotic cells	111	126	Cell"	"macrophages	184	195	Cell"	"apoptotic cells	285	300	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""apoptotic cell"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 184, ""end_span"": 195, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 285, ""end_span"": 300, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Apoptotic cells are removed rapidly and efficiently as intact cells or apoptotic bodies by professional phagocytes or by neighboring cells.	"Apoptotic cells	0	15	Cell"	"cells	62	67	Cell"	"phagocytes	104	114	Cell"	"cells	133	138	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""phagocytes"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Again, no differences were found in the percentage of macrophages that had engulfed apoptotic cells ( Figure 7a, c, e) or in the relative number of phagocytosed apoptotic cells per macrophage ( phagocytotic index; Figure 7f).	"macrophages	54	65	Cell"	"apoptotic cells	84	99	Cell"	"apoptotic cells	161	176	Cell"	"macrophage	181	191	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 161, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""macrophage"", ""start_span"": 181, ""end_span"": 191, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Thus, Ptdsr - deficient macrophages had a normal ability to ingest apoptotic cells and were not impaired in recognition or phagocytosis of cells that had undergone programmed cell death.	"macrophages	24	35	Cell"	"apoptotic cells	67	82	Cell"	"cells	139	144	Cell"	"cell	175	179	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 35, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 179, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Furthermore, phagocytosis assays in vitro demonstrated a completely normal uptake of apoptotic cells by Ptdsr - / - macrophages, with some knockout macrophages showing loads even higher than wild - type of engulfed dead cells.	"apoptotic cells	85	100	Cell"	"macrophages	116	127	Cell"	"macrophages	148	159	Cell"	"cells	220	225	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 159, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 220, ""end_span"": 225, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Using co - localization of TUNEL - positive cells with F4 / 80 - positive macrophages they suggested that Ptdsr - / - embryos exhibited a three - fold increase in the frequency of unphagocytosed TUNEL - positive cells together with a severely reduced number of F4 / 80 - positive cells.	"cells	44	49	Cell"	"macrophages	74	85	Cell"	"cells	212	217	Cell"	"cells	280	285	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 212, ""end_span"": 217, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 280, ""end_span"": 285, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
As recognition of phosphatidylserine is thought to be a universal engulfment mechanism for all cells that are able to phagocytose apoptotic cells, it is very striking that apoptotic cell clearance mediated by non - professional bystander cells is also not compromised by Ptdsr - deficiency.	"cells	95	100	Cell"	"apoptotic cells	130	145	Cell"	"apoptotic cell	172	186	Cell"	"cells	238	243	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cell"", ""start_span"": 172, ""end_span"": 186, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 238, ""end_span"": 243, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
( e) Quantification of phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by wild - type or Ptdsr - / - macrophages revealed no differences in the percentage of macrophages that had engulfed apoptotic cells, whether or not apoptosis had been induced by staurosporine.

While recombined LACZ marker expression was detected in most articular cartilage cells, it was also observed in scattered subarticular chondrocytes, growth plate chondrocytes, and osteoblasts ( Figure 5O and 5T) ( unpublished data).

This synovial hypertrophy is associated with increased numbers of mononuclear cells resembling synoviocytes or macrophages, cell types that are difficult to distinguish even with surface markers at early postnatal stages.

Such contrast enhancement may rest in large part on the particular properties of dendrodendritic synapses between the principal output neurons ( mitral cells) and local inhibitory neurons ( granule cells) of the olfactory bulb.

Despite its specific expression in pluripotent cells and germ cells, ESG1 is dispensable for self - renewal of ES cells and establishment of germcells.

It is also expressed in pluripotent cells, including ES cells, embryonic germ cells, and multipotent germline stem cells [ 15].

Despite specific expression in early embryos, germ cells, and pluripotent cells, our data demonstrated that ESG1 is dispensable for mouse development, germ cell formation, and ES cell self - renewal.

However, comprehensive cell - type analysis of the rescued double - null retina exposed cell - cycle - independent differentiation defects specifically in starburst amacrine cells ( SACs), cholinergic interneurons critical in direction selectivity and developmentally important rhythmic bursts.

By P8 there are no RPCs, fewer RTCs, an OPL, and more differentiated rods ( r) and cones ( c) in the ONL; horizontal ( h), bipolar ( b), M u ller ( m), and amacrine ( a) cells in the INL; and ganglion ( g) and displaced amacrine cells in the GCL.

The loss of Rb KO rods is evident from the thinner ONL, and the death of these cells as well as bipolar and ganglion neurons can be detected directly by double labelling for apoptotic and cell - type - specific markers [ 2] ( M.

( A) Horizontal retinal sections from mice of the indicated ages and genotypes were stained for nuclei ( DAPI, blue) and markers that detect ganglion cells ( Pou4f2, red), rods and cones ( Sag [ rod arrestin], green), and rod bipolar cells ( Prkca, green, and Cabp5, red).

ERGs functionally assess visual signalling in the mammalian retina from photoreceptors to amacrine cells ( but usually not gangion cells), and are dominated by rod and cone bipolar cells.

We obtained similar results for Sv2c, a synaptic vesicle protein found in SACs [ 40]; Kcnc1b and Kcnc2, potassium channels expressed on SAC soma and dendrites as well as a very small number of ganglion cells [ 41]; gamma - aminobutyric acid ( GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter present in about half of amacrine cells including SACs, as well as horizontal and some bipolar neurons [ 37]; and Calb1 ( calbindin), which is expressed in many amacrine cells and labels SAC process faintly ( Figure S7A and S7B; Table S1; and data not shown).
