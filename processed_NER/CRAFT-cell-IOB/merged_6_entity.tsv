In light of the prominent expression of RanBP2 and HKI in retinal neurons [ 1, 19], the vital dependence of the neuronal retina ( and brain) on glucose as the main substrate source for energy production, and the determinant impact of metabolic disorders, such as diabetes, in retinal function ( e. g., diabetic retinopathy) [ 37], we probed the impact of deficits in RanBP2, HKI, and ATP, on the electrophysiological responses of subclasses ( rod and cone) photoreceptor and postreceptor retinal neurons of RanBP2 + / - and in RanBP2 + / + mice.	neurons,66,73,Cell	neuronal,112,120,Cell	rod,193,196,Cell	cone,451,455,Cell	photoreceptor,457,470,Cell	neurons,496,503,Cell	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 120, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 193, ""end_span"": 196, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 451, ""end_span"": 455, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 457, ""end_span"": 470, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 496, ""end_span"": 503, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	train
Ultrastructural studies demonstrated that the cells that coexpress rod and cone genes in the rd7 retina represent a morphologically hybrid cell type, intermediate between normal rods and cones.	cells,46,51,Cell	rod,67,70,Cell	cone,75,79,Cell	cell,139,143,Cell	rods,178,182,Cell	cones,187,192,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""rods"", ""start_span"": 178, ""end_span"": 182, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cones"", ""start_span"": 187, ""end_span"": 192, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	valid
In conclusion, it is clear that this second cell population in the rd7 retina has morphological features of both normal rods and cones consistent with the coexpression of many rod - and cone - specific genes in these cells.	cell,44,48,Cell	rods,120,124,Cell	cones,129,134,Cell	rod,176,179,Cell	cone,186,190,Cell	cells,217,222,Cell	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""rods"", ""start_span"": 120, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cones"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 176, ""end_span"": 179, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 186, ""end_span"": 190, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 217, ""end_span"": 222, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"	valid
