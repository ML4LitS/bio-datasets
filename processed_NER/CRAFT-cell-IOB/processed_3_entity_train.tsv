The initial development and partial differentiation of hair cells in Brn3c mutants could possibly lead to some neurotrophin expression in these cells to sustain sensory neurons through embryonic development and beyond.

Afferents reach all three rows of outer hair cells in the basal turn of control wildtype littermates ( Fig. 2c), but both afferent and efferent outgrowth is disorganized to outer hair cells in Brn3c null mutants ( Fig. 2d) and does not show any clear organization into three distinct longitudinal fiber bundles paralleling the three rows in the outer hair cell region.

To test the hypothesis that a temporal delay in the onset of transcriptional programs is crucial for the control of appropriate neuronal maturation, we studied the development of proprioceptive DRG neurons, since transcriptional effectors regulated by target - derived signals, as well as some of their downstream biological actions, have been identified for these neurons.

To determine whether neuronal survival of DRG neurons from TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos in the absence of neurotrophic support is sufficient to explain the observed neuronal outgrowth, we analyzed DRG isolated from mice mutant in the proapoptotic gene Bax [ 27].

Moreover, BrdU pulse - chase experiments ruled out the possibility that DRG neurons in TauEWS - Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos reenter the cell cycle ( no BrdU + / LacZ + cells, n = 3 embryos, analysis of > 50 sections each; Figure 6F and 6L).

This temporally delayed and target - induced upregulation of ETS transcription factor expression several days after a neuronal lineage of a specific identity first emerges is not restricted to DRG sensory neurons, but is also found in motor neuron pools [ 13].

Target - derived factors have also been implicated in controlling neuronal maturation of predetermined neurons in Drosophila, in which expression of members of the BMP family in the target region is essential for the induction of mature peptidergic properties in a subpopulation of neurons marked by the coordinate expression of the two transcription factors Apterous and Squeeze [ 11, 12].

ADAM22 ' s sequence similarity to other ADAMs suggests it to be an integrin binder and thus to have a role in cell - cell or cell - matrix interactions.

Although the cause of death in this mouse is unknown, for these phenotypes, impaired cell - cell or cell - matrix interactions in the nervous system caused by loss of ADAM23 may be responsible.

Despite the high level of expression of ADAM22 mRNAs in the cerebellar granule cells, granule cell layer was normally formed and Purkinje cell morphology ( calbindin - staining) of the mutant mouse looked intact ( Figs. 4A - D).

Because the CF mouse intestinal phenotype is characterized by an innate type immune response, with increases in mast cells and neutrophils, the genes that affect these cells are of special interest.

Because of the inflammation of the CF small intestine, and the possible effects of immune cells on mucus secretion, the genes in the identified regions which are involved in mast cell and neutrophil differentiation and behavior are of special interest as potential CF modifiers.

The roles of PAX6 in brain development have mainly been studied in homozygous mutant mice or rats and include arealisation of the cerebral cortex [ 7], formation of the prosencephalon - mesencephalon boundary [ 8], axon guidance [ 8], differentiation of neurons from glia [ 9] and neuronal migration in the cerebellum [ 10].

Our findings identify endogenous Sam68 as a positive regulator of adipocyte differentiation and a negative regulator of osteoblast differentiation, which is consistent with Sam68 being a modulator of bone marrow mesenchymal cell differentiation, and hence bone metabolism, in aged mice.

Bone loss in the elderly has also been attributed to alterations in the response of bone marrow stromal cells to their microenvironment that favors differentiation down the adipocyte lineage rather than the osteoblast lineage [ 22].

Osteoblasts and adipocytes are derived from a common mesenchymal precursor cell present in bone marrow, and the factors that control this age - induced switch toward adipogenic differentiation is not well understood [ 24].

Indeed, the ectopic expression of the QKI - 6 / 7 isoforms in vivo led to the formation of glial cells rather than neurons from neural progenitor, demonstrating its role in cell fate determination [ 34].

Furthermore, Sam68 - / - mouse embryo fibroblasts ( MEFs) were impaired in their capacity to differentiate into adipocytes, consistent with Sam68 being a regulator of bone marrow mesenchymal cell differentiation.

When cells were expressed as a function of the bone perimeter ( nOB / BP, nOC / BP), there were no statistical differences and the ratio of osteoblasts to osteoclasts was similar in all groups of mice ( Table 3).

Cultures of bone marrow stromal cells harvested from 4 - week - old Sam68 - / - mice and maintained for 18 days in osteoblast differentiation medium demonstrated more intense staining for ALP at 6 days ( unpublished data) and 18 days ( Figure 6A), and more mineralized nodules at 18 days, than the Sam68 + / + mice, even though similar amounts of fibroblast colony - forming units ( CFU - F) were observed ( Figure 6A and unpublished data).

. The expression of OCN and beta - actin mRNAs was examined by semiquantitative RT - PCR and the Sam68sh - expressing cells displayed a more pronounced osteoblast phenotype compared with control cells, as assessed by the expression of OCN ( Figure 8B).

These data demonstrate that Sam68 regulates the differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal cells to promote adipocyte differentiation and inhibit osteoblast differentiation in aging bone.

The differentiation of bone marrow stem cells isolated from Sam68 - / - mice and embryonic mesenchymal multipotential progenitor cells C3H10T1 / 2 treated with Sam68 shRNA resulted in a more pronounced osteoblast differentiation.

Ex vivo differentiation of primary bone marrow stromal cells, harvested from Sam68 + / + and Sam68 - / - mice, down the osteoblast lineage revealed an osteogenic advantage in the cultures of cells derived from the Sam68 - / - mice.

Our findings that aged Sam68 - / - mice do not develop fatty bone marrow and that MEFs derived from Sam68 - / - mice have impaired adipocyte differentiation, indicate that Sam68 regulates both adipocyte and osteoblast differentiation.

mu - calpain and m - calpain are ubiquitously expressed proteases implicated in cellular migration, cell cycle progression, degenerative processes and cell death.

However, expression of calpains with these modified small subunits did not give rise to any detectable calpain activity when expressed in E. coli, although their functionality in mammalian cells has yet to be determined ( J. S. Elce, unpublished work) It has also been suggested that calpain large subunits alone might provide some activity in eukaryotic cells, although the Zimmerman et al. knockout appears to exclude that possibility, and no calpain activity was observed in our hands when calpain large subunits were expressed alone either in E. coli or in mammalian cells [ 36].

Compensation for mu - calpain deficiency by m - calpain is therefore less likely in platelets and erythrocytes than in other cell types.

If it is true that m - calpain is essential for some aspect of cell viability, the survival of a few Capn2 - / - embryos to the 8 - cell stage is most likely due to the persistence of some maternal m - calpain mRNA and / or protein through 2 - 3 cell divisions.

In both CHO cells and Capn4 - / - MEFs, calpain was shown to influence cell proliferation, but only at very low cell densities [ 5].

Furthermore, calpain - independent mechanisms for protecting cell viability might exist in these cell lines that are absent in early embryonic cells.

The repeated failure to achieve gene conversion of Capn2 + / - to Capn2 - / - ES cells by selection of clones in high concentrations of G418 suggests that the homozygous mutant state somehow compromises cell viability or clonal selection of ES cells.

FGF9 was detectable at normal levels in testis cords in XY KitW / Wv gonads, where alkaline phosphatase staining verified the absence of germ cells ( Figure 1G - 1J), indicating that FGF9 is expressed by Sertoli cells, and that its expression is not dependent on the presence of germ cells.

The three mutations in the loxP257 spacer sequence prevent it to recombine with WT loxP, ensuring efficient RMCE in several cell lines: accurate RMCE with these loxP sites occurred with an average frequency of 81% at two loci in CHO cells and an average frequency of 69% at four loci in Hela cells ( 14).

Subsequently cardiac neural crest cells ( CNCCs) delaminate, undergo a phenotypic transformation from an epithelial to mesenchymal cell type, and migrate latero - ventrally into the 3rd, 4th and 6th pharyngeal arch arteries ( PAAs), where they contribute to the formation of the smooth muscle cell layer of endothelial structures derived from the aortic arch arteries [ 1 - 3].

The skeletal elements in these various BMP - deficient animals contained normal prehypertrophic chondrocytes expressing type II collagen, hypertrophic chondrocytes expressing type X collagen, as well as the osteoblasts expressing type I collagen, like their wild - type counterparts ( Figure S2; compare Figure S2F - S2H with Figure S2B - S2D; and unpublished data).

Since we observe fibroblastic cells adjacent to mineralized cartilage that have characteristics of osteoprogenitor cells but fail to express osterix in the absence of both BMP2 and BMP4, one important role of BMP2 and BMP4 during endochondral ossification may be to induce osterix gene expression in osteoprogenitors.

The aberrant Sertoli cell organization in Dmrt7 mutant testes raised the possibility that the germ cell phenotype might indirectly result from defects in Sertoli cell function.

The Desert hedgehog ( Dhh) promoter is active starting at about E12. 5 in pre - Sertoli cells but not in germ cells, allowing deletion of Dmrt7 in Sertoli cells well before any likely requirement for its function [ 52].
