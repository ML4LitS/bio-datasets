Several genes involved in inflammation and the immune system are located in the regions of the markers identified: TNF superfamily members Tnfsf4, 6, and 8 ( chr. 1, 84. 9 - 85 cM) which are involved in T cell activation [ 37, 38]; three selectin genes ( Sele, Sell, Selp, chr. 1, 86. 6 cM) which are involved in immune cell infiltration into inflamed tissues [ 39]; several members of immune cell surface proteins of the Slam family ( slamf1, 2, 5, 6, and 9; chr. 1, 89. 5 - 93. 3 cM) [ 40]; the chemokine gene Xcl1 ( chr. 1, 87 cM) which is expressed by mast cells and recruits lymphocytes [ 41]; several immunoglobulin Fc receptor genes ( Fcrl3, Fcgr2b, and Fcgr3 at chr. 1, 92. 3 cM; Fcer1g at chr. 1, 93. 3 cM; Fcer1a at chr. 1, 94. 2 cM); the flagellin receptor Tlr5 ( chr. 1, 98 cM); Mmp3 ( chr. 9, 1 cM) which recruits CD4 + lymphocytes [ 42]; Mmp7 ( chr. 9, 1 cM) which activates Paneth cell - derived cryptdins ( alpha - defensins) [ 43]; Icam1 ( chr. 9, 7 cM) which is involved in lymphocyte infiltration into inflamed tissues [ 44]; Kitl ( chr. 10, 57 cM) which is also known as stem cell factor, and is crucial for mast cell differentiation [ 45]; Im5 ( chr. 10, 65 cM) which is involved in antibody - responsiveness [ 46]; Lyzs ( chr. 10, 66 cM) which is a Paneth cell product that digests cell walls of bacteria [ 47]; Ifng ( chr. 10, 67 cM) which is an important inflammatory signal in CF as well as other conditions [ 48]; Il22 ( chr. 10, 67 cM), a member of the anti - inflammatory IL - 10 interleukin family [ 49]; and the Stat2 and 6 genes ( chr. 10, 70 cM) which are important components of intracellular signaling pathways [ 50].
