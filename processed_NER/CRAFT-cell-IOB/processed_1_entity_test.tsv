Although the mutations in each of these genes arrest cells at a similar stage of development, our results suggest that gata1 and tif1 gamma act independently.	"cells	53	58	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This does not rule out the possibility that parallel genetic pathways involving gata1 and tif1 gamma, operating together, regulate gene transcription within blood cells.	"blood cells	157	168	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""blood cells"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 168, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

We reasonably predict that Tif1 gamma protein functions as a transcriptional intermediary factor in hematopoietic progenitor cells given that both TIF1 alpha ( Zhong et al. 1999) and TIF1 beta ( Friedman et al. 1996; Abrink et al. 2001) have been shown to act as intermediary factors that positively or negatively regulate gene transcription.

Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterised by the production of autoantibodies ( auto - Abs) against a wide spectrum of self - antigens, mainly from subcellular compartments, especially the cell nucleus.	"cell	191	195	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 191, ""end_span"": 195, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This region contains several genes, including those encoding Fc gamma RII, the complement receptor CR1 / 2 ( CD35 / CD21), and the decay - accelerating factor CD55 ( Prodeus et al. 1998; Bolland and Ravetch 2000; Miwa et al. 2002; Wu et al. 2002), which have each been implicated in the causation of SLE when inactivated by gene - targeting in 129 embryonic stem cells.

Furthermore, a 129 - derived interval on distal Chromosome 1, when transferred onto the C57BL / 6 genome, a combination commonly created by backcrossing onto C57BL / 6 a gene that has been inactivated in 129 embryonic stem cells, was sufficient to cause humoral autoimmunity in its own right, irrespective of the presence of the mutated Apcs gene.

Detailed genetic studies in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans have recently yielded evidence that basic phagocytic mechanisms and pathways for the recognition and engulfment of apoptotic cells are highly conserved throughout phylogeny [ 7, 8].

In most cases the receptors on phagocytes that recognize these PS - bridging molecules have not been defined, but it has been reported that GAS - 6 is a ligand for the tyrosine kinase receptor Mer and that MFG - E8 can bind to the vitronectin receptor alpha v beta 3 [ 16, 24].

Consistent with the observations of Kunisaki and colleagues [ 32], we found severely blocked erythropoietic differentiation at an early erythroblast stage in the liver ( Figure 3f, 3l), suggesting an explanation for the grossly anemic appearance that we observed in our Ptdsr - / - mice.

Close examination of retinal structures revealed that the inner granular layer was still less expanded in Ptdsr - deficient animals, however, and that it contained fewer cells and was still severely underdeveloped in comparison with the corresponding retinal layer in control animals ( Figure 4c, 4g and 4d, 4h).

Apoptosis of interdigital cells in the distal mesenchyme of limb buds occurs most prominently from developmental stages E12. 0 to E13. 5 and can be easily examined in situ by whole - mount terminal deoxynucleotide transferase - mediated UTP end - labeling ( TUNEL).

This study demonstrated that there is an initial phase of cell death during the invagination of the optic cup ( E10. 5), followed by subsequent waves of apoptosis induction immediately before and after birth ( E18. 5 to postnatal day P2), and from postnatal days P9 to P10 and P14 to P16 [ 42].

Comparative analysis of ten different tissues and organs in Ptdsr + / + and Ptdsr - / - animals at several stages of embryonic development and in neonates failed to identify impaired uptake of apoptotic cells at any time during development.

In previous studies in the mouse, the distribution and amount of apoptotic cells in Ptdsr - knockout and control animals were investigated in only a few tissues and at one [ 31] or two [ 32] developmental stages.

[ 31] examined lung, midbrain and retina at day E17. 5 of gestation and identified apoptotic cells by TUNEL staining.	"apoptotic cells	83	98	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Their findings must be interpreted with caution because remodeling of cellular structures by apoptosis in specific retina layers is known to occur mainly postnatally [ 42], and apoptosis plays an important physiological role in the maintenance and homeostasis of lung epithelium after birth or in pathological conditions involving pulmonary inflammation and not during lung development [ 46].

This postnatal role for apoptosis is in accordance with our data, as we rarely observed apoptotic cells in retina or lung tissue throughout embryogenesis in Ptdsr + / + and Ptdsr - / - mice.

[ 32] analyzed TUNEL - stained sections of liver and thymus at days E13. 5 and E16. 5 of development in Ptdsr + / - and Ptdsr - / - embryos and found reduced rather than increased numbers of TUNEL - positive cells in Ptdsr - deficient embryos.

Thus, it seems possible that recruitment and activation / differentiation of macrophages after adoptive transfer and thioglycollate elicitation are affected by Ptdsr - deficiency.	"macrophages	77	88	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

[ 45] reported that psr - 1, the C. elegans homolog of Ptdsr, is important for cell - corpse engulfment, whereas psr - 1 RNAi studies performed by Arur et al.	"cell	79	83	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Moreover, Wang and colleagues hypothesized on the basis of their data that psr - 1 might act to transduce an engulfment signal upstream of Ced - 2 ( Crk II), Ced - 5 ( Dock 180), Ced - 10 ( Rac 1) and Ced - 12 ( Elmo) in one of the two cell - corpse engulfment pathways in the worm [ 45].

The developmental malformations cannot be explained by impaired clearance of apoptotic cells, a process that proved to be normal in Ptdsr - deficient mice.	"apoptotic cells	77	92	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This opens up the possibility either that there is an as - yet unknown Ptdsr receptor, which might act as a primary phosphatidylserine recognition receptor, or that recognition of phosphatidylserine and subsequent apoptotic cell engulfment and anti - inflammatory signaling are mainly mediated through phosphatidylserine bridging proteins and their cognate receptors.

They then turned laterally towards motor neurons in the lateral motor column, where they branched and terminated ( Figure 2A).	"motor neurons	35	48	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""motor neurons"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In order to distinguish between a role for NT - 3 in initiation of motor neuron innervation and a role for maintenance, we repeated the DiI labeling at E17.	"motor neuron	67	79	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""motor neuron"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In WT and Bax KO embryos, proprioceptive fibers extended towards ventral horn motor neurons ( Figure 3A and 3B), whereas the ventral horns of the NT - 3 KO embryos were devoid of innervation ( Figure 3C).	"motor neurons	78	91	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""motor neurons"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
As the sensory axons never reach motor neuron dendrites in the ventral horn ( Figure S1), the stretch reflex arc circuit is not established.	"motor neuron	33	45	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""motor neuron"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The failure to initiate contact between sensory axons and motor neurons in the absence of NT - 3 suggests a requirement for NT - 3 for proper axon targeting in addition to a role in sensory axon maintenance.

Although NT - 3 - dependent cells were rescued, no muscle spindles were detected in the limbs of double KOs ( Figure 4A and 4B).	"cells	28	33	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Proprioceptive axons in mice enter the gray matter in the spinal cord and advance ventrally parallel to the midline by E13 and reach the motor neurons by E15 ( Ozaki and Snider 1994).

Previously noted chemoattractant action of the embryonic mouse maxillary process on trigeminal ganglion neurons ( Lumsden and Davies 1986) is now attributed to NT - 3 and brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF) ( O ' Connor et al. 1999).	"neurons	104	111	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In that study, though, assays on the effectiveness of antibody perturbation on NT - 3 - dependent cell survival showed that effectiveness was significant ( approximately 90%) but not complete ( Oakley et al. 1995).	"cell	98	102	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Previously, normal motor neuron innervation was rescued in NT - 3 KO animals by over - expressing NT - 3 selectively in their muscles ( Wright et al. 1997).	"motor neuron	19	31	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""motor neuron"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
It appears that peripheral NT - 3 alone is sufficient for rescuing proprioceptive neurons in NT - 3 KO animals and proper axonal pathfinding in the spinal cord.	"neurons	82	89	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The possibility has been raised that motor neurons may retrogradely transport NT - 3 in muscle to the spinal cord ( Chen and Frank 1999).	"motor neurons	37	50	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""motor neurons"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Based on the available evidence showing that all proprioceptive neurons are eliminated in NT - 3 or TrkC null mice, we think that TrkC staining in the tibial nerve mostly represents proprioceptive axons in the vicinity of their peripheral target.	"neurons	64	71	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
It is highly possible that a small but considerable number of DRG cells express the transcription factor Er81 and that their axons grow beyond the intermediate levels of the spinal cord in Bax / NT - 3 double KO mice.	"cells	66	71	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
While the phenotype of Er81 KO mice is quite dramatic, and most proprioceptive axons stop within the intermediate spinal cord, it is important to note that a few axons still find their way to the ventral spinal cord and target properly to the motor neurons ( Arber et al. 2000).	"motor neurons	243	256	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""motor neurons"", ""start_span"": 243, ""end_span"": 256, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
( 2003) also present observations from islet2DTA mice, which lack a significant portion of the motor neurons in the ventral cord.	"motor neurons	95	108	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""motor neurons"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Patel et al. argue that since motor neurons are absent in these mice, NT - 3 secreted by them could not be a signal for proprioceptive axons to enter the lateral motor columns.	"motor neurons	30	43	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""motor neurons"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
However, there is no evidence showing that NT - 3 mRNA or protein expressed in the ventral spinal cord is exclusively from motor neurons, and there are no available data indicating that in islet2DTA mice, NT - 3 expression in the ventral spinal cord is abolished ( Yang et al. 2001; Pun et al. 2002).	"motor neurons	123	136	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""motor neurons"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Studies in embryonic mice reported NT - 3 mRNA in the ventral horns of the spinal cord, but it is not definitive that both mRNA and protein are expressed solely by motor neurons.

Finally, in culture assays, we see a strong chemoattraction of DRG neurons to localized sources of NT - 3.	"neurons	67	74	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Another molecule, Slit2, expressed in the midline and by motor neurons ( Wang et al. 1999) is capable of inducing axonal branching ( Nguyen Ba - Charvet et al. 2001; O zdinler and Erzurumlu 2002).	"motor neurons	57	70	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""motor neurons"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
DRG neurons express Robo receptors, which bind to Slits, and proprioceptive axons are therefore capable of responding to Slit signals ( Wang et al. 1999).	"neurons	4	11	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
These observations suggest that axonal targeting defects in Bax / NT - 3 double KO mice cannot be simply due to lack of PV expression in proprioceptive cells.	"cells	152	157	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 152, ""end_span"": 157, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
NT - 3 most likely acts cooperatively with other axon guidance molecules or by regulating expression of yet to be identified proprioceptive neuron - specific receptors / ligands for numerous axon guidance cues.

This observation strongly suggests that the striatal cell specificity of the polyglutamine expansion in the context of huntingtin must be determined by some aspect of huntingtin ' s structure, subcellular location or activities [ 2].	"cell	53	57	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Huntingtin ' s large number of diverse cytoplasmic and nuclear protein binding partners strongly suggest that huntingtin may participate in a variety of cellular processes that range from trafficking of growth factor complexes to gene transcription ( reviewed in [ 5, 8, 9].

However, huntingtin deficient embryos do not display obvious visceral endoderm defects, with the notable exception of compromised iron transport in later stage mutants, although iron uptake is undisturbed [ 16] and endocytosis is not impaired in huntingtin deficient embryos or embryonic stem cells [ 16, 18].

However, close inspection of the data reveals abnormal patterning within this tissue and its derivatives. T, normally expressed in the primitive streak, node and axial head process / notochord mesoderm [ 22], is detected in the shortened streak and axial mesoderm in Hdhex4 / 5 / Hdhex4 / 5 embryos, extending rostrally from a region of weakly positive cells ( Fig. 2A, B).

T expression appears weaker, however, in the anterior streak, corresponding to cells that will give rise to axial mesoderm ( Fig. 2D).	"cells	79	84	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Similarly, Evx1, normally expressed in primitive streak mesoderm at E7. 5 with highest levels in proximal cells [ 23], is expressed in the proximal shortened streak but is also aberrantly expressed throughout the extraembryonic mesoderm, allantois and chorion ( Fig. 2E, F).

Rather than a node, mutant embryos exhibit a region of disorganized cells ( *) at the distal extent of the short primitive streak.	"cells	68	73	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

Furthermore, in mutant embryos at E7. 5, the expression of Dll1 in the distal streak region and in only a narrow swath of cells located laterally confirms the paucity of paraxial mesoderm ( Fig. 2K, L, [ 24]).

Expressed just prior to streak formation in the posterior epiblast and visceral endoderm, Fgf8 is restricted to the streak mesoderm at E7. 5 in a decreasing proximal - distal gradient and is downregulated in cells shortly after they exit the streak ( Fig. 3E, G).

However, in the mutant Hdhex4 / 5 / Hdhex4 / 5 embryos, high levels of Gsc expression remain unrestricted in the endoderm overlying the entire embryo and ectopically in cells adjacent to the ectoplacental cone ( Fig. 3J, L).

Primitive germ cells ( PCGs) are induced normally in both wild - type ( G) and mutant embryos ( H), suggesting the Bmp4 signaling from the extraembryonic ectoderm to the epiblast is normal.

Whole mount staining of E7. 5 mutant and wild - type embryos for alkaline phosphatase activity reveals that PCGs form in Hdhex4 / 5 / Hdhex4 / 5 embryos, suggesting that Bmp4 signaling is functional in the absence of huntingtin ( Fig. 4G, H).

We have investigated the embryonic processes that require huntingtin in order to more precisely delineate huntingtin ' s essential molecular and cellular activities and to provide clues to the mechanism by which the dominant polyglutamine expansion mutation in huntingtin leads to HD pathogenesis.

Nor can it be simply explained by delayed development, as stage - specific markers, such as Wnt3a and primordial germ cells, which are detectable at E7. 0 in wild - type embryos, are induced appropriately.

Moreover, extraembryonic Bmp4 signaling is not impaired in the absence of huntingtin, as the induction of PCGs in mutant embryos is normal, implying proper transport and secretion of the appropriate extraembryonic signals.

In addition, it is possible that other extraembryonic signal ( s) that we have not analyzed may also be affected by the lack of huntingtin activity in extraembryonic cells in mutant embryos.

In HD patients and in accurate genetic replicas, HD CAG knock - in mice, the dominant mutation specifically affects the major population of neurons in the striatum, without impairing huntingtin ' s essential activities in embryonic development [ 50 - 53].

The quest to understand the HD mechanism, therefore, is aimed at delineating the huntingtin activity that may explain the striatal cell specificity of the polyglutamine mutant version of huntingtin.

Additionally, using a renal cell line we show that the mutated protein, AQP2 - F204V, is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and that this abnormal localization can be rescued by wild - type protein.

AVP binding to its receptor on kidney cells begins a series of biochemical events that ultimately results in the insertion of a protein, aquaporin 2 ( AQP2), into the outer surface of the kidney cell.

As its name suggests, AQP2 facilitates the reuptake of water from the urinary space into the cell, thus concentrating the urine and conserving water.	"cell	93	97	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Aquaporin - 2 ( AQP2) is a pore - forming protein belonging to a family of water channels [ 4], and it is expressed in collecting - duct principal cells in the kidney [ 5].	"cells	147	152	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 147, ""end_span"": 152, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Generally these proteins permit the passage of water through the plasma membrane ( PM) of cells, several of which carry out this role specifically in the process of water reabsorption from urine in the kidney.	"cells	90	95	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
For this process to occur, AVP binds its receptor, AVPR2, on the basolateral face of the collecting duct cells, leading to a rise in intracellular cAMP, ultimately resulting in phosphorylation of AQP2 at serine 256 by cAMP - dependent protein kinase [ 9] and its redistribution to the plasma membrane.

Molecular analyses concluded that mutant AQP2 adopts a different subcellular localization in renal collecting - duct cells, and was resistant to translocation induced by desmopressin, an agonist of AVP.

In kidneys taken from mutant animals, however, AQP2 was distributed randomly throughout the cell in the basal state ( Figure 4A, third row), while AQP3 ( green) appropriately localized to the basolateral surface [ 23].

To investigate the mechanism of defective translocation of AQP2 - F204V, we turned to transfection of MDCK cells.	"cells	107	112	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Stable cell lines expressing mouse wild - type AQP2 and AQP2 - F204V were established.	"cell	7	11	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 7, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

In transfected, unstimulated MDCK cells, wild - type AQP2 ( stained green) appeared in a punctate pattern distributed throughout the subapical region ( Figure 4B, left column photomicrographs), consistent with vesicular compartmentalization.	"cells	34	39	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
To test the idea that AQP2 - F204V localizes to the ER, we co - stained cells transfected with Aqp2F204V ( cDNA) for AQP2 and an ER marker, calnexin ( Figure 4C).	"cells	72	77	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
It has also been shown that wild - type AQP2 protein can rescue a translocation - defective mutant protein, AQP2 - P262L, when the two are coexpressed in MDCK cells [ 25].	"cells	159	164	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 164, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
To test this idea, we first looked for an interaction between mutant and wild - type proteins in transfected MDCK cells ( Figure 5B).	"cells	114	119	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
MDCK cells stably expressing wild - type AQP2 were transiently transfected with GFP expression constructs encoding GFP - tagged wild - type AQP2, AQP2 - F204V, or GFP alone.	"cells	5	10	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Antibodies against GFP coimmunoprecipitated wild - type AQP2 when AQP2 - GFP or AQP2 - F204V - GFP was transiently transfected, but not when GFP by itself was transiently transfected into MDCK cells stably expressing wild - type AQP2 ( Figure 5B, upper blots).	"cells	193	198	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 193, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
If wild - type and mutant proteins are indeed interacting in the cell, is this interaction sufficient to rescue the localization of mutant protein?	"cell	65	69	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
To answer this question, we used MDCK cells stably transfected with wild - type AQP2 expressing vector or with empty vector.	"cells	38	43	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
AQP2 - F204V - GFP, when expressed by transient transfection into vector only cells, showed a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution pattern ( Figure 5C, lower left).	"cells	78	83	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
When expressed in wild - type AQP2 cells, however, AQP2 - F204V - GFP localized to the apical surface to varying degrees ( Figure 5C, lower right images [ i - iii]).	"cells	35	40	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The lower right images of Figure 5C shows three cells from a single transfection.	"cells	48	53	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The first is a nontransfected cell that shows the localization of the stably expressing wild - type AQP2, which is apical upon forskolin stimulation.	"cell	30	34	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In cell ( ii), localization of wild - type AQP2 was indistinguishable from AQP2 - F204V - GFP; both were apical upon forskolin stimulation.	"cell	3	7	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 7, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Although the effect was subtle in cell ( iii), AQP2 - F204V - GFP was partly localized to the apical surface.	"cell	34	38	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
To confirm these results biochemically, we transfected the same cell lines ( wild - type AQP2 or vector) with F204V - GFP, biotinylated surface proteins after forskolin stimulation, and precipitated the biotinylated proteins ( Figure 5D).	"cell	64	68	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 68, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Curiously, AQP2 - T126M does localize properly in at least a subset of cells.	"cells	71	76	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Colocalization of AQP2 - F204V with the ER protein calnexin in transfected MDCK cells shows that, while most of the mutant protein is trapped in the ER, some does progress beyond the ER.	"cells	80	85	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Diminished response to dDAVP, diminished abundance of mature glycosylated protein in mutant animals, and the transport of a fraction of mutant protein beyond the ER in MDCK cells are all consistent with the notion that AQP2 - F204V misfolding is limited and that it may retain some residual water transporting activity.

( 26) have demonstrated that one recessive allele of Aqp2, P262L, does not properly translocate when expressed by itself in MDCK cells, but that in the presence of wild - type protein, it localizes normally.

Immunostaining the kidneys of homozygous Aqp2F204V / F204V mice shows that the mutant - expressing collecting duct cells can not mediate water reabsorption, because it fails to insert into the apical plasma membrane in response to dDAVP.

While in the formation and storage of olfactory memory piriform cortex [ 5 - 7], hippocampus [ 8, 9], and olfactory bulb [ 10 - 12] are all implicated, the cellular correlates for these processes have not been clearly delineated.	"cellular	156	164	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cellular"", ""start_span"": 156, ""end_span"": 164, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Concerning odor discrimination itself, cellular mechanisms for this process are often attributed to the inhibitory circuitry of the olfactory bulb ( [ 24 - 30]; reviewed in [ 31 - 33]).	"cellular	39	47	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cellular"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Given that neuronal circuits underlying odor discrimination, as well as olfactory memory, rely on properties of fast excitatory neurotransmission mediated by alpha - amino - 3 - hydroxy - 5 - methyl - 4 - isoxazolepropionate receptors ( AMPARs), we sought to alter, by genetic means, the specific functional contribution of alpha - amino - 3 - hydroxy - 5 - methyl - 4 - isoxazolepropionate ( AMPA) channels containing the dominant subunit GluR - B.	"neuronal	11	19	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Notably, the normally low Ca2 + permeability of AMPA channels in principal neurons is solely mediated by GluR - B, due to a unique arginine residue ( R587) in the functionally critical glutamine / arginine ( Q / R) site of the pore - forming segment M2 [ 44, 47, 48], resulting from RNA editing of GluR - B pre - mRNA ( [ 49]; reviewed in [ 50]).	"principal neurons	65	82	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""principal neurons"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Thus, the absence of GluR - B, or the expression of GluR - B ( Q) in the olfactory bulb, may generate increased inhibition in mitral cells.	"cells	133	138	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Moreover, the ablation of GluR - B, but also changes in the extent of Q / R site editing of GluR - B, can alter the strength of excitatory synaptic transmission in the genetically addressed neuronal populations [ 51, 58, 60], thus potentially shifting the balance of excitatory and inhibitory transmission in the affected circuits.

Thus, Cre - recombinase removes in forebrain neurons the intronic TK - neo gene, leading to the active GluR - B Delta ECS allele for Q / R site - unedited GluR - B ( Q) subunits ( Figures 1 and S1).

This is further supported by kainate - induced Co2 + uptake in acute brain slices, revealing considerably higher Co2 + uptake via Ca2 + - permeable AMPARs in hippocampal pyramidal neurons of mice expressing GluR - B ( Q), than those lacking GluR - B ( DRS, RS, and PHS, unpublished data).

Normally, GluR - B - containing AMPARs are prominently localized at the dendrodendritic synapse between mitral and granule cells in the olfactory bulb [ 64, 65].	"granule cells	115	128	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""granule cells"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
As Ca2 + influx through glutamate receptors is thought to contribute to lateral and recurrent inhibition ( [ 38] see also [ 39]), the absence of GluR - B, or the presence of GluR - B ( Q) in the olfactory bulb, is likely to result in increased inhibition between the principal neurons in this structure.

Evidence suggests that the production of reactive oxygen species is a major effect of acute cadmium toxicity ( 68, 69), and exposure of cultured cells or animals to cadmium is associated with depletion of reduced glutathione, lipid peroxidation and DNA damage ( 70 - 73).

One potential mechanism by which amyloid may be more efficiently removed in the human disease than in the mouse models is through microglial phagocytosis.	"microglial	130	140	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""microglial"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 140, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Resident microglia in transgenic mouse models localize to tissue surrounding plaques but show little evidence of amyloid engulfment [ 37 - 40].	"microglia	9	18	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""microglia"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In contrast, microglia surrounding amyloid plaques in human brain show a much higher state of activation with greater expression of complement receptor [ 40].	"microglia	13	22	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""microglia"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Thus, the role of microglia in amyloid metabolism is minor in transgenic models compared to the human condition.	"microglia	18	27	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""microglia"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Even so, we considered the possibility that chronic dox treatment may have altered the activation state of microglia in our treated mice.	"microglia	107	116	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""microglia"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

Careful study of the mechanism behind several of the antibody - mediated therapies has suggested that activated microglia play an important role in the removal of fibrillar plaques after immunization [ 50, 52, 55].	"microglia	112	121	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""microglia"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
However, it has been noted that deletion of the Fc receptor ( the primary receptor for microglial opsinization of antibody - antigen complexes) in APP transgenic mouse models has no impact on the effectiveness of antibody - mediated therapy [ 56, 57].	"microglial	87	97	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""microglial"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
It is, nevertheless, possible that lack of microglia activation is the major difference between the slow clearance described here, where no perturbation of the immune system is expected, and the rapid clearance described in studies involving antibody or viral injection.	"microglia	43	52	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""microglia"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In isolation, mild activation of microglia by injection damage or opsinization may not be adequate to induce substantial phagocytosis, but when combined with an A beta - lowering agent, such as neprilysin or A beta - targeted antibodies, the two may work in concert to clear peptide deposits.	"microglia	33	42	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""microglia"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Consistent with this hypothesis, strong activation of microglia through transgenic expression of TGF beta [ 58] or central injection of lipopolysaccharide [ 59, 60] can by itself substantially reduce plaque burden in APP transgenic mice.	"microglia	54	63	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""microglia"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This finding reinforces the notion that without continued stimulation, microglia in mouse models do not maintain the same level of sustained activation that may occur in humans.	"microglia	71	80	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""microglia"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

Even at later stages in the disease, the presence of substantial microglial activation in human AD [ 40] suggests that simply slowing the formation of new amyloid deposits may allow ongoing phagocytosis to diminish preexisting lesions.

The p - value indicates minimum significant difference between wt and the indicated cell lines analysed on the same microscopic slide within one experiment.	"cell	84	88	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Next we asked whether the Xpd + XPCS and Xpd + XP alleles, despite decreased mRNA levels, ameliorated TTD symptoms by increasing overall TFIIH levels in compound heterozygous XpdTTD / + XPCS and XpdTTD / + XP cells.	"cells	209	214	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 209, ""end_span"": 214, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Previously, using comparative immunohistochemistry, we and others have shown an up to 70% reduction of TFIIH levels in primary fibroblasts from patients with TTD compared with wt controls due to reduced stability [ 16, 17].	"fibroblasts	127	138	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""fibroblasts"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Despite overexpression of mRNA from the XpdTTD allele relative to the wt allele ( Figure 1E), TFIIH protein levels were reduced by 50% in primary mouse XpdTTD / TTD fibroblasts ( Figure 4E and 4F), thereby mimicking the situation in human patients with TTD.	"fibroblasts	165	176	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""fibroblasts"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In accordance with the gene dosage, a further reduction of up to 70% of the wt level was observed in hemizygous XpdTTD / KO cells.	"cells	124	129	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Consistent with low mRNA expression levels, neither the Xpd + XPCS nor the Xpd + XP allele was able to restore TFIIH abundance to wt levels in XpdTTD compound heterozygote cells ( Figure 4E and 4F).	"cells	172	177	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 172, ""end_span"": 177, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Thus, the improved UV survival observed in compound heterozygote cells ( Figure 4A) and likely the rescue of TTD progeroid symptoms ( Figure 3) were not due to normalisation of TFIIH levels, suggesting a qualitative rather than a quantitative effect on these phenotypes in vivo.	"cells	65	70	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 70, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
An overview of the functional relationships between Xpd alleles, phenotypes, and the presumed underlying TFIIH function in mice and cells is presented in Table 2.	"cells	132	137	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We observed differences in the ability of XpdTTD versus homozygous lethal Xpd + XPCS and Xpd + XP alleles to function in two transcription - related phenotypes separated in the organism by both time and space: embryonic lethality and terminal differentiation of enucleating skin and blood cells.	"enucleating skin and blood cells	262	294	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""enucleating skin and blood cells"", ""start_span"": 262, ""end_span"": 294, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
TTD - specific cutaneous and anaemic features, on the other hand, are thought to result from a specific kind of transcriptional insufficiency caused by depletion of unstable TFIIH during the terminal differentiation of skin, hair - shaft, and blood cells [ 16, 24].	"blood cells	243	254	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""blood cells"", ""start_span"": 243, ""end_span"": 254, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
During early embryonic development, XpdTTD is dominant over the Xpd + XPCS and Xpd + XP alleles, whereas later in the ontogenesis of skin, hair - shaft, and blood cells, the situation is reversed.	"blood cells	157	168	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""blood cells"", ""start_span"": 157, ""end_span"": 168, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
However, the observation that no other cellular or biochemical UV - related parameters were improved in XpdTTD / + XPCS argues against complementation of this repair activity in the rescue of TTD progeroid symptoms in vivo.	"cellular	39	47	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cellular"", ""start_span"": 39, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
However, based on the ability of cell extracts that are defective in two different TFIIH components ( XPD and XPB) to complement NER activity in vitro [ 26], it is likely that TFIIH ( or its components) can either multimerise or exchange at least during the NER reaction.	"cell	33	37	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Although interallelic complementation between two endogenous mutant alleles has been described in cells from a compound heterozygous patient with methylmalonic acidaemia, no observable effects on disease outcome were noted in the patient [ 28].

Latex bead labelling and comparative immunofluorescence analysis of the p62 subunit of the TFIIH was performed as described previously [ 16, 17] using primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts at passages 2 - 5.

Polymorphisms and mutations in coagulation factors, fibrinolytic factors, platelet surface receptors, methylenetetrahydrofalate reductase, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and antioxidant enzymes have been implicated as genetic determinants of susceptibility to thrombosis [ 6, 7].	"platelet	74	82	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""platelet"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Clot formation and lysis, which ultimately determine thrombosis, requires platelet aggregation, coagulation, and fibrinolytic functions.	"platelet	74	82	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""platelet"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The results of this study indicate that the two inbred strains, B6 and A / J mice, have diverse prothrombotic phenotypes, unrelated to coagulation or platelet aggregation.	"platelet	150	158	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""platelet"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

We provide evidence that in wild - type embryos, heterochromatin domains are extensively reorganized between the two - cell and blastocyst stages.	"cell	119	123	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In embryonic stem cells, depletion of p150CAF - 1 using RNA interference results in the mislocalization, loss of clustering, and decondensation of pericentric heterochromatin domains.	"stem cells	13	23	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""stem cells"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Furthermore, loss of CAF - 1 in these cells results in the alteration of epigenetic histone methylation marks at the level of pericentric heterochromatin.	"cells	38	43	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Our findings underline the role of the chromatin assembly machinery in controlling the spatial organization and epigenetic marking of the genome in early embryos and embryonic stem cells.

Here, the authors studied the role of a basic chromatin assembly factor ( CAF - 1) in mouse embryonic stem cells and early embryos.	"stem cells	102	112	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""stem cells"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This new knowledge may contribute to better understanding the role of chromatin in the maintenance of embryonic stem cell identity and plasticity.	"stem cell	112	121	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""stem cell"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Yet we know very little about the role of histone modifying enzymes, chromatin remodeling factors, and histone chaperones during pre - implantation development, or in stem cells derived from early embryos [ 6].	"stem cells	167	177	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""stem cells"", ""start_span"": 167, ""end_span"": 177, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
While the function of this evolutionary conserved histone chaperone has been studied extensively biochemically, we still lack information concerning its importance during early development in mammals and in pluripotent cells such as embryonic stem ( ES) cells.	"cells	219	224	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 219, ""end_span"": 224, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Here, we have analyzed the importance of CAF - 1 during early mouse development by genetic ablation and in ES cells by depletion using RNA interference ( RNAi).	"cells	110	115	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We show that CAF - 1 is essential for viability in early mouse embryos and ES cells.	"cells	78	83	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We provide evidence that CAF - 1 is required for the spatial organization and epigenetic marking of heterochromatin domains in pluripotent embryonic cells.	"cells	149	154	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 149, ""end_span"": 154, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We used gene targeting in ES cells to delete exon 3 in the Chaf1a gene, which encodes p150CAF - 1 ( Figure 1A).	"cells	29	34	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Thus, depletion of p150CAF - 1 protein from this stage allows a maximum of two additional cell divisions before developmental arrest.	"cell	90	94	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In wild - type blastocysts and in mouse somatic cells, pericentric heterochromatin domains cluster together and form higher - order chromatin structures called chromocenters [ 20], which are visualized as DAPI - dense foci ( Figure 1C).	"cells	48	53	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
For this purpose, we examined the status of heterochromatin organization between the two - cell and blastocyst stages.	"cell	91	95	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In two - cell stage wild - type embryos, DAPI staining is diffuse and fibrillar, with regions of higher density around the nucleolar precursor bodies ( Figure 1E).	"cell	9	13	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Thus, the nuclear organization of heterochromatin is dramatically modified during pre - implantation development, between the two - cell and blastocyst stages.	"cell	132	136	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In Chaf1a - / - E4 embryos, which are arrested between the eight - and 16 - cell stage, DAPI - dense foci were barely detectable ( Figure 1D).	"cell	76	80	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This abnormal organization of heterochromatin in Chaf1a - / - embryos is reminiscent of the heterochromatin organization found in two - to four - cell stage wild - type embryos ( compare Figure 1D and 1F).	"cell	146	150	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Given the early developmental arrest observed in Chaf1a - / - embryos, such cells could not be derived directly from null embryos, and we thus used an RNAi strategy ( Figure 2A).	"cells	76	81	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
p150CAF - 1 knockdown in ES cells was quantified by Western blot analysis and IF.	"cells	28	33	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This result indicates that p150CAF - 1 is essential for nuclear organization of heterochromatin in ES cells in a similar way to early pre - implantation embryos.	"cells	102	107	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Surprisingly, we did not observe this severe alteration in heterochromatin organization in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs) following p150CAF - 1 depletion by RNAi.	"fibroblasts	115	126	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""fibroblasts"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
p150CAF - 1 depletion in MEFs resulted in a strong inhibition of cell proliferation ( unpublished data), but did not alter the clustering of heterochromatin domains ( Figures 2C and S2).	"cell	65	69	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Similarly, p150CAF - 1 depletion in 3T3 cells did not affect heterochromatin organization [ 16].	"cells	40	45	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
These observations reveal a specific function for CAF - 1 in the early embryo and ES cells.	"cells	85	90	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We also wondered whether loss of p150CAF - 1 in ES cells specifically affects the heterochromatin nuclear subcompartment, or whether it might result in a more global loss of nuclear organization and architecture.	"cells	51	56	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We could not detect any significant difference in the distribution and aspect of PML nuclear bodies between control and p150CAF - 1 - depleted ES cells ( Figure 2D).	"cells	146	151	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 151, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Thus, CAF - 1 is specifically required in early embryos and in ES cells for the proper organization of the heterochromatin subnuclear compartment.	"cells	66	71	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Previous studies performed in mammalian cell lines showed that CAF - 1 activity is required for S phase progression [ 16, 23, 24].	"cell	40	44	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We show here that 3 d after transfection of the RNAi vector, p150CAF - 1 - depleted cells ( identified by a complete absence of CAF - 1 IF signal) appear still active for replication, as revealed by incorporation of the thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine ( BrdU) ( Figure 3A), the PCNA ( proliferating cell nuclear antigen) pattern ( Figure 3B), and flow cytometry analysis ( Figure 3C).	"cells	84	89	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Hence, in these cells, DNA replication persists despite the drastic changes in heterochromatin organization.	"cells	16	21	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In p150CAF - 1 RNAi - depleted cells, we observed a disruption of pericentric heterochromatin clusters that coincides with the disappearance of DAPI - dense foci ( Figure 4B).	"cells	31	36	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Individual pericentric domains from single chromosomes are now found either isolated or aggregated in a pattern less dense than the regular clusters observed in control cells ( Figure 4B).	"cells	169	174	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Quantification of fluorescence along a line randomly drawn across the nucleus revealed lower fluorescence intensity and a broader distribution of DAPI and major satellite hybridization signals in p150CAF - 1 - depleted cells ( Figure 4C and 4D), indicating decondensation of pericentric heterochromatin domains.	"cells	219	224	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 219, ""end_span"": 224, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In contrast, centric domains showed an intensity and shape similar to control cells, suggesting that they remain unaffected by p150CAF - 1 depletion ( Figure 4C and 4D).	"cells	78	83	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Using DNase I and micrococcal nuclease ( MNase) assays, we could not observe any significant difference between control and p150CAF - 1 - depleted ES cells at the level of bulk genome chromatin or at pericentric repeats ( Figure 5).	"cells	150	155	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 155, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In a second series of experiments, we compared the association of histone H3 with chromatin in nuclei isolated from cells transfected with control and p150CAF - 1 RNAi plasmid vectors.	"cells	116	121	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In all conditions, the amount of histone H3 remaining associated with chromatin was indistinguishable in control and p150CAF - 1 - depleted ES cells ( unpublished data).	"cells	143	148	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Our findings showed that the nuclear localization of HP1 alpha is severely altered in Chaf1a - / - embryos and p150CAF - 1 - depleted ES cells.	"cells	137	142	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We first tested DNA CpG methylation [ 25] at major satellite repeats and found no significant difference between control and p150CAF - 1 - depleted cells ( Figure 6).	"cells	148	153	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The H3K9me3 mark [ 32] was also significantly reduced in p150CAF - 1 - depleted cells, though to a lesser extent than H4K20me3 ( Figure 7A and 7B).	"cells	80	85	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In wild - type cells, most of H4K20me3 and H3K9me3 signals are present at the level of DAPI - dense domains when visualized by IF [ 29] ( Figures 7C and 7D).	"cells	15	20	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 15, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
H3K9me3 was severely perturbed in p150CAF - 1 - depleted cells, displaying a diffuse pattern similar to HP1 alpha ( Figure 7C).	"cells	57	62	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The H4K20me3 pattern was even more severely altered, showing both a loss of the typical dots revealed in control cells and a reduction in signal intensity ( Figure 7D).	"cells	113	118	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Altogether, our results show that depletion of CAF - 1 in ES cells leads to a simultaneous disruption of heterochromatin 3 - D organization and an alteration in epigenetic marking.	"cells	61	66	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Here, we provide evidence that p150CAF - 1 has a crucial function during mouse early embryogenesis and in ES cells.	"cells	109	114	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

Similarly, CAF - 1 is essential in mammalian cell lines for the progression of DNA replication [ 16, 23, 24, 34].	"cell	45	49	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 49, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

We show that in p150CAF - 1 - depleted ES cells, while DNA replication initially persists without significant perturbation in nucleosomal organization, severe heterochromatin organization defects can be observed.

Loss of p150CAF - 1 did not affect PML bodies in ES cell nuclei, showing that nuclear architecture is not generally altered.	"cell	52	56	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Given the major defects observed in heterochromatin organization, it is tempting to speculate that these defects cause the developmental arrest in the embryos and death in ES cells.	"cells	175	180	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 180, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In ES cells, major architectural chromatin proteins are hyperdynamic and bind relatively loosely to chromatin [ 35].	"cells	6	11	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In this cellular context, our findings show that proper heterochromatin nuclear architecture relies on CAF - 1 function.	"cellular	8	16	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cellular"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

In mouse ES cells, we show that CAF - 1 is also required for regular levels of H4K20me3 at pericentric repeats, but not at IAP elements, which are repeated sequences spread all over the mouse genome.	"cells	12	17	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
These data suggest that proper nuclear organization and epigenetic marking of pericentric heterochromatin are coupled in ES cells.	"cells	124	129	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We show here that CAF - 1, which is a H3. 1 replication - dependent loading complex [ 11], is specifically required for the nuclear organization of pericentric heterochromatin in embryos and ES cells.

While this has to be addressed experimentally, it is worthwhile to mention an alternate possible mechanism that might explain the disruption of heterochromatin domains in p150CAF - 1 null embryos and ES cells.

Slightly reduced cell numbers were not due to residual RTC death since we have not observed ectopic apoptosis at any embryonic or postnatal stage in the developing Rb / E2f1 DKO retina ( Figures 1D, 1G, and S2).	"cell	17	21	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The discovery that E2f1 loss rescues even the morphology of Rb KO neurons is surprising because Rb is thought to regulate differentiation primarily through E2f - independent pathways [ 30 - 33].

Responses to dim light in dark - adapted ( scotopic) conditions specifically assess the rod system, and were defective in the Rb KO retina ( Figure 2E).	"rod	88	91	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The substantial reduction of both a - and b - waves is consistent with rod and bipolar cell apoptosis [ 2].	"rod and bipolar cell	71	91	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rod and bipolar cell"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

We first studied Calb2 ( calretinin), which marks a subset of amacrine and ganglion cell bodies as well as three tracks corresponding to their processes in the IPL ( Figure 3A).	"amacrine and ganglion cell	62	88	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""amacrine and ganglion cell"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We quantified Calb2 + cell bodies in the Rb KO INL ( corresponding to amacrine cell staining only) and observed a reduction from P8 onwards ( Figures 3C and S6).	"amacrine cell	70	83	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""amacrine cell"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
SACs are cholinergic, represent ~ 5. 2% of amacrine neurons [ 38], and are critical for both direction selectivity [ 34, 35] and spontaneous rhythmic activity that occurs during normal retinal development [ 36].

Chat was seen in fewer cells in the mature Rb KO retina, and was present in the soma but absent from processes ( Figure 3B).	"cells	23	28	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Finally, we also examined the effect of Rb deletion on SAC differentiation using a Chx10 - Cre transgene that is expressed in a mosaic pattern across the retina, generating patches of Cre - expressing cells [ 42].

Importantly, Camk2a + tracks and dendrites were present in both the WT and Rb KO retina ( Figure 3B), and the number of Camk2a + soma was similar in WT and Rb KO retina at P30 and beyond, although fewer cells stained in Rb KO retina at P18, suggesting a delay in its appearance ( Figures 3C and S6B).

A direct role for E2f in mediating Rb - dependent differentiation defects ( independent of cell cycle or death defects) has to our knowledge not been described, but because E2f can regulate some differentiation genes [ 44 - 48], we first tested whether E2f2 or E2f3 might perturb Rb KO SAC maturation.	"cell	91	95	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
At multiple time points, E2f1 deletion suppressed ectopic mitosis ( PH3 + cells), but did not reverse the SAC defect, and E2f2 deletion had no effect on either defect ( Figure 4A).	"cells	74	79	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Rb / E2f3 DKO SAC tracks were slightly more disordered than in WT retina, most likely because of the absence of synaptic partner cells, which are killed by E2f1.	"cells	129	134	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Indeed, this minor defect was rescued in the Rb / E2f1 / E2f3 triple knockout retina, where bipolar and ganglion cell death was rescued and SAC differentiation was restored ( Figure 4A).	"bipolar and ganglion cell	92	117	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""bipolar and ganglion cell"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We quantified the fraction of Camk2a + SACs in different genotypes and found that 60% of WT P30 Camk2a + cells expressed Chat and Slc18a3, which dropped to only 5. 6% in the Rb KO retina, and remained low at 3. 7% in the Rb / E2f1 DKO retina, but rose to 91% in the Rb / E2f3 DKO retina ( Figure 4B).	"cells	105	110	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We found that 98. 2% +/- 1. 8% of Isl1 + cells in the forming inner INL at P5 were also Slc18a3 +, confirming that Isl1 is an excellent SAC marker ( Figure 4C).	"cells	41	46	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Moreover, Isl1, unlike Slc18a3, is nuclear, which facilitates scoring of Isl1 + / Mki67 + cells.	"cells	90	95	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
It is also expressed earlier than Slc18a3, permitting analysis of SACs soon after their birth at ~ E15; thus, we could study retina at P0, a time when ectopic division is high in the inner retina and prior to Rb - independent cell cycle exit associated with terminal differentiation [ 2].	"cell	226	230	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 226, ""end_span"": 230, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Indeed, about one - third of all Isl1 + cells in the entire inner NBL were dividing in the Rb KO retina, or ~ 50% in the periphery where Cre is expressed ( Figure 4E and data not shown).	"cells	40	45	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We observed similar effects at P0 with Calb2, which marks newborn SACs and other amacrine cells ( data not shown).	"amacrine cells	81	95	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""amacrine cells"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

These data suggest that Rb and E2f3 colocalize in SACs and that E2f3 triggers defects in SAC differentiation because it is specifically expressed in these retinal neurons.	"neurons	163	170	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 163, ""end_span"": 170, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Note the absence of E2f3 protein in the peripheral E2f3 KO RPCs at P0 and in peripheral inner retinal neurons at P18.	"neurons	102	109	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

We also found that E2f3 is present in a specific subset of mature neurons in various brain regions ( data not shown).	"neurons	66	73	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Unlike in retinal SACs, E2f3 was not coexpressed in Chat + or Slc18a3 + cholinergic neurons located in various regions of the brain and spinal cord ( data not shown).	"cholinergic neurons	72	91	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cholinergic neurons"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
To our knowledge, the subcellular location of E2f3 isoforms has not been determined in any cell type.	"cell	25	29	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Consistent with the drop in E2f3 - expressing cells during WT retinal maturation ( Figure 5A), the total amount of E2f3a was less at P18 compared to P0 ( Figure 6).	"cells	46	51	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Analysis of Pou4f2, a nuclear transcription factor expressed in ganglion cells, showed that nuclear proteins had not contaminated the cytoplasmic fraction, and analysis of Slc18a3, a cytoplasmic SAC marker, confirmed that the reverse had also not occurred ( Figure 6).

Thus, among the cell cycle regulators we examined, most showed bivalent distribution, and E2f3b was unusual in its solely nuclear compartmentalization.	"cell	16	20	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

Division and death genes were induced in Rb KO cells, and deleting E2f1, but not E2f2 or E2f3, reversed these molecular events.	"cells	47	52	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
E2f1 may also regulate differentiation targets, but whether this contributes to defects in retinal cell maturation is impossible to separate from potentially indirect consequences of deregulated division and death.	"cell	99	103	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We have also found that E2f1 deletion rescues cell - autonomous ectopic division, death, and differentiation defects in sporadic Rb KO clones generated using a Cre retrovirus vector ( M. P. and R. B., unpublished data).	"cell	46	50	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Thus, deregulated E2f1 activity in the retina, whether resulting from the inactivation of Rb or from overexpression, promotes unscheduled cell division and triggers apoptosis in susceptible RTCs.	"cell	138	142	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Comprehensive marker analysis revealed that, in striking contrast to other retinal neurons, E2f1 deletion did not suppress defects in Rb KO cholinergic SACs.	"neurons	83	90	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 83, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
These data expand insight into the development of these important interneurons, but more critically, provide to our knowledge the first unambiguous evidence that Rb regulates neurogenesis beyond terminal mitosis.	"interneurons	66	78	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""interneurons"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
There is no direct evidence that Rb is required for terminal differentiation of other cell types.	"cell	86	90	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Moreover, deleting E2f1, but not E2f3, reversed deregulated expression of cell cycle and apoptotic genes in the Rb KO retina.	"cell	74	78	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Thus, E2f3 inhibition is the first, and may be the only, mechanism by which Rb participates directly in neuronal differentiation.	"neuronal	104	112	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
E2f3b was the primary candidate, since Rb and E2f3b collaborate to repress targets in quiescent cells in vitro [ 19].	"cells	96	101	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 96, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
E2f3a and E2f3b share 110 C - terminal amino acids that encode the NLS, DNA - binding, marked box, transactivation, and Rb - binding domains [ 16], yet they exhibit different subcellular distribution in developing retinal cells.	"cells	222	227	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 222, ""end_span"": 227, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Rb family and Tfdp proteins can also determine E2f localization [ 20 - 22], and we found that a portion of both Rb and Tfdp1 proteins are cytoplasmic in retinal cells.	"cells	161	166	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 161, ""end_span"": 166, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In the retina, differentiating transition cells are born in the absence of Rb, migrate to the correct layer, and express appropriate markers ( [ 2] and this work).	"cells	42	47	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In the case of SACs, the differentiation defects we observed ( e. g., loss of Slc18a3 and Chat) were not due to aberrant division, but it is possible there are other problems with these cells that are caused by ectopic division.	"cells	186	191	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 186, ""end_span"": 191, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Nevertheless, it is clear that many aspects of differentiation in multiple cell types are compatible with ectopic division.	"cell	75	79	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
However, division of terminally differentiating cells is dangerous, since it may facilitate transformation, as is the case in retinoblastoma ( reviewed in [ 66]).	"cells	48	53	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Both scenarios are feasible since E2fs regulate differentiation genes [ 44 - 48], and cell cycle regulators, such as Cdkn1b, have cytoplasmic activities that influence differentiation [ 68, 69].	"cell	86	90	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
However, these studies did not assess whether these cell types differentiate normally if Rb is deleted along with one or more E2f family members.	"cell	52	56	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
