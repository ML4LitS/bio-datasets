Strikingly, the majority of the photoreceptors in the rd7 retina represent a morphologically hybrid cell type that expresses both rod - and cone - specific genes.

In order to rule out the possibility that these scattered positive cells were simply the normal complement of cones that had failed to localize their cell bodies to the scleral edge of the ONL, the number of positive cells in the rd7 retina was quantitated by dissociated cell in situ hybridization.

This value is approximately 2 - fold greater than the percentage of S - opsin - positive cells identified in wild - type control retinas, 1. 65% ( 54 S - opsin - positive cells out of 3, 271 DAPI - positive cells), and accords well with the previously reported value of 2 - to 3 - fold more S - opsin - positive cells in rd7 compared to wild type arrived at by antibody staining of tissue sections [ 17].

Nrl is a rod - specific, basic leucine zipper transcription factor required for the activation of many rod - specific genes and the repression of most cone - specific genes in rods [ 24].

Crx is a homeobox transcription factor expressed in both rods and cones and is required for the expression of a variety of rod - and cone - specific genes [ 25].

"These findings, along with the absence of rhodopsin staining in these cells ( see Figure 3D - 3F), suggest that these "" cone - like "" cells in the rd7 mutant retina may represent supernumerary normal cones with an abnormal localization of their cell bodies."

The second cell population in the ONL of the rd7 retina has some of the nuclear features of normal rods, such as a single, dense mass of heterochromatin and moderately electron - dense euchromatin ( Figure 7H); yet these cells also show features of cones.

The coexpression of both rod and cone genes in the same cell could predispose the cell to apoptosis.

These interactions suggest that APC can potentially regulate many cellular functions, including intercellular adhesion, cytoskeletal organization, regulation of plakoglobin levels, regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis, orientation of asymmetric stem cell division, and control of cell polarization [ 2, 3].
