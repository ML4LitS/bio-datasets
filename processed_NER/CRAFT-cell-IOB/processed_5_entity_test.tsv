Differentiation of epithelial cells occurs in the equatorial / bow region of the lens, where epithelial cells begin to elongate and differentiate into fiber cells of uniform cellular shape, arranged in radial columns of cells extending from the anterior epithelium to the posterior capsule.

These definitive hematopoietic stem cells seed the later developing marrow spaces, to produce all lineages of adult blood cells, including definitive erythrocytes, myeloid cells, and lymphocytes.

To re - examine and further independently validate the result of normal apoptotic cell uptake by Ptdsr - / - macrophages, we performed phagocytosis assays for 60 min and determined the percentage of macrophages that had engulfed apoptotic cells, in a total of at least 300 macrophages counted by fluorescence microscopy.

The phagocytotic index was calculated according to the following formula: phagocytotic index = ( total number of engulfed cells / total number of counted macrophages) x ( number of macrophages containing engulfed cells / total number of counted macrophages) x 100.

Microscopic analysis ( b, d) and quantification of the number of apoptotic cells phagocytosed by single macrophages and ( f) calculation of the average number of cells phagocytosed per macrophage failed to reveal differences in the efficacy of removal of apoptotic cells between wild - type and Ptdsr - / - FLDMs.	"apoptotic cells	65	80	Cell"	"macrophages	104	115	Cell"	"cells	162	167	Cell"	"macrophage	185	195	Cell"	"apoptotic cells	255	270	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 162, ""end_span"": 167, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""macrophage"", ""start_span"": 185, ""end_span"": 195, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 255, ""end_span"": 270, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"

Rods and cones make up the outer nuclear layer ( ONL); horizontal, bipolar, and amacrine cells, as well as M u ller glia cell bodies, reside in the inner nuclear layer ( INL); and ganglion and displaced amacrine cells form the ganglion cell layer ( GCL) ( Figure 1A).

Cones represent only 3% of photoreceptors and, unlike rods, develop without Rb, but they require rods for survival, and in the Rb KO retina, they have abnormal morphology and their synaptic targets, bipolar cells, are much depleted [ 2].

Importantly, major Rb / E2f1 DKO neurons differentiated normally, and ERGs revealed the rescue of rod - and cone - mediated function, implicating a regular signal flow from photoreceptors to bipolar and amacrine cells.
