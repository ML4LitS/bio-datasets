AlphaB expression is detected in central epithelium and increases from the central to elongation zones, where epithelial cells differentiate into fiber cells.

In contrast to wild type lenses ( Figure 3L and 3Q), the alphaA / BKO lenses ( Figure 3B and 3G) contained large areas devoid of cellular material, their nuclei were not limited to a well defined equatorial / bow region, and ordered radial columns of elongating fiber cells extending from the posterior capsule to the anterior epithelium were not observed.

At 54 wk, these cells in the alphaA / BKO lenses were larger in cross sectional diameter than wild type, and exhibited a much greater variation in the cross sectional size and cell shape.

In the equatorial / bow region, a disorganized array of relatively small irregular shaped cells were observed in 5 wk ( Figure 4A) and 54 wk ( Figure 4D) alphaA / BKO lenses, while elongated fiber cells organized into radial columns, with ball and socket interdigitations, were observed in 5 wk ( Figure 4G), 46 wk ( Figure 4J) and 72 wk ( data not shown) wild type lenses.

In contrast, radial columns of elongated fiber cells of uniform size and shape containing ball and socket interdigitations were observed in the posterior subcapsular region in 5 wk ( Figure 4I), 46 wk ( Figure 4L) and 72 wk ( data not shown) wild type lenses, and fiber cells in contact with the posterior capsule could be traced back to the equatorial bow region and anterior epithelium.

"The morphological observations presented in this study demonstrate that fiber cells in lenses lacking alphaA and alphaB fail to elongate symmetrically from the bow region and therefore do not establish the typical "" onion skin "" conformation in which cells extend from the anterior epithelium to the posterior capsule."

Additionally, in lenses from 54 wk alphaA / BKO lenses, there was a persistence of cell nuclei in deeper cortical regions, and ectopic cell nuclei were present in large numbers in the anterior central cortex.

These morphological observations are consistent with a defect in the normal differentiation pathway of lens epithelial cells into fiber cells.

In the 5 wk alphaA / BKO lenses, nucleic acid staining in the posterior subcapsular region is consistent with either anterior epithelial cells migrating aberrantly to the posterior pole, or primary fiber cells failing to fully differentiate by 5 wks of age.

This entire process from epithelial cell to mature fiber cell is defined as lens differentiation.

Alpha - crystallin may play a functional role in the cell nucleus and may have a role in regulating the cell cycle.

In lens epithelium derived from alphaAKO lenses, cell growth rates were reported to be 50% lower compared to wild type [ 31], suggesting a role for alphaA in regulating the cell cycle.	"cell	49	53	Cell"	"cell	173	177	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 173, ""end_span"": 177, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Beaded filament mRNA levels increase greatly in differentiating lens epithelial cells, and have been suggested as a pan - specific marker for lens fiber cells [ 17].

It is therefore possible that increased synthesis of alpha - crystallin in epithelial cells early in the differentiation process may have profound effects upon the cytoskeleton, which in turn may profoundly affect cell shape and migration.

Studies in murine erythroid cell lines demonstrate that Tif1 gamma protein is localized within novel nuclear foci, and expression decreases during erythroid cell maturation.

Hematopoiesis in vertebrates, from zebrafish to humans, is an evolutionarily conserved program that produces two waves of stem or progenitor cells that differ both in their embryonic origins and in the lineages of differentiated blood cells produced ( Palis and Yoder 2001; Orkin and Zon 2002; Galloway and Zon 2003).

During embryogenesis, homozygous zebrafish mon mutants have no red blood cells ( RBCs) visible in circulation ( Ransom et al. 1996; Weinstein et al. 1996).

The hematopoietic cells are thus correctly specified early during the development of mon mutant embryos, but these precursors undergo cell death.

The mon gene is thus required for normal development and survival of both committed erythroid progenitor cells and posterior mesenchymal cells.

In wild - type zebrafish, the adult site of hematopoiesis is the kidney ( Al Adhami and Kunz 1977), which contains erythroid, lymphoid, and myeloid populations at various stages of differentiation ( Bennett et al. 2001).

In mon homozygous mutants, there is a severe block in maturation at the proerythroblast stage ( Figure 2), whereas the differentiation of myeloid cells is normal ( unpublished data).

In contrast, the monm262 allele has 10 - 100 circulating blood cells by 48 hpf, in comparison to the approximately 3, 000 RBCs in the circulation of wild - type or heterozygous embryos at the same time point.

Microinjection of synthetic wild - type mon mRNA at the one - cell stage rescues the formation of embryonic erythrocytes in genotyped mutant embryos without causing obvious defects in embryonic patterning or organogenesis.

Our examination of hematopoietic gene expression, apoptosis, and marrow histology in mon mutants demonstrates that early erythroid progenitors are formed in homozygous mutants, but they fail to properly differentiate and instead undergo programmed cell death ( see Figure 1).

The human serum amyloid P component binds avidly to DNA, chromatin, and apoptotic cells in physiological conditions in vitro ( Pepys 1974; Pepys and Butler 1987; Butler et al. 1990) and also to exposed chromatin and apoptotic cells in vivo ( Hintner et al. 1988; Breathnach et al. 1989; Familian et al. 2001).

The phosphatidylserine receptor ( Ptdsr) on phagocytes has been implicated in the recognition and engulfment of apoptotic cells and in anti - inflammatory signaling.

Most of the cells produced during mammalian embryonic development undergo physiological cell death before the end of the perinatal period [ 3].

Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells is very distinct from other engulfment processes that result, for example, in the clearance of microorganisms, because engulfment of apoptotic cells triggers the secretion of potent anti - inflammatory and immunosuppressive mediators, whereas pathogen recognition causes the release of pro - inflammatory signals [ 6].

The importance of efficient mechanisms for apoptotic cell clearance in vivo is supported by the observation that autoimmune responses can be provoked in mice when key molecules for apoptotic cell recognition and uptake are missing.

The exposure of the phospholipid phosphatidylserine ( PS) in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane of apoptotic cells has been described as one of the hallmarks of the induction of apoptosis and is considered to be one of the most important signals required for apoptotic cell recognition and removal [ 19].

Moreover, the binding of Ptdsr to PS on apoptotic cells has been reported to be important for the release of anti - inflammatory mediators, including transforming growth factor - beta 1 ( TGF - beta 1), platelet - activating factor ( PAF), and prostaglandin E2 [ 26, 27].

Most interestingly, the nuclear localization of Ptdsr in Hydra epithelial cells did not change upon phagocytosis of apoptotic cells.

The kinetics of cell death occurrence and regression of the interdigital web was similar in wild - type and mutant littermates, providing no evidence that Ptdsr - deficiency is associated with impaired clearance of apoptotic interdigital cells during limb development.

The same was true for the developing kidney: apoptotic cells were present in Ptdsr + / + and Ptdsr - / - embryos, in limited numbers, but we failed to detect any differences in the number of apoptotic cells between the genotypes ( Figure 6c, 6g).

We therefore tested whether Ptdsr - / - macrophages were able to release anti - inflammatory cytokines after ingestion of apoptotic cells.

Quantification of TGF - beta 1 and IL - 10 levels after 22 hours of culture demonstrated that Ptdsr - / - macrophages were able to secrete these anti - inflammatory cytokines upon ingestion of apoptotic cells, although at a slightly lower level than wild - type ( Figure 8a, b).

This indicates that ablation of Ptdsr function does not compromise in general the ability of macrophages to release immune - suppressive cytokines after recognition and engulfment of apoptotic cells.

Ptdsr - deficiency does, however, affect the overall release of pro - and anti - inflammatory cytokines after stimulation with LPS and after double treatment with LPS and apoptotic cells, indicating that Ptdsr - deficient macrophages have a reduced capacity to produce or secrete pro - and anti - inflammatory cytokines.

Furthermore, we failed to detect any differences in the number of apoptotic cells in Ptdsr - knockout and wild - type animals in the rare cases where we could detect apoptotic cells within lung tissues.

Li et al. proposed [ 31] that the eye phenotype they observed could be explained by failed removal of apoptotic cells during eye development, but we think that the observed defects are unrelated to a failure of apoptotic cell clearance.

Thus, besides the formation of the inner and outer layers of the optic cup in early eye development, other major phases of retinal cell apoptosis take place only postnatally and correspond to important periods in the establishment of neuronal connections.

Other studies that connect the postnatal elimination of apoptotic photoreceptor cells to Ptdsr - mediated macrophage engulfment [ 43] should be interpreted with extreme caution as these studies were based on the monoclonal anti - Ptdsr antibody mAb 217G8E9 [ 26, 43] ( see below).

Exencephaly and hyperplastic brain phenotypes were observed at a low penetrance in Ptdsr - mutant mice ( less then 4. 5% of homozygotes), but these do not resemble to any extent the brain - overgrowth phenotypes of caspase - or Apaf1 - knockout mice ( [ 44], and references therein) in that we failed to identify any differences in the number or distribution of apoptotic cells or pyknotic cell clusters in the neuroepithelium of Ptdsr - / - and Ptdsr + / + mice.

Thus, reduced cell death or diminished clearance of apoptotic neural progenitor cells is unlikely to be the cause of the brain hyperplasia.

Investigation of apoptotic cell clearance in vivo in Ptdsr - / - embryos conclusively showed that removal of apoptotic cells is not compromised by ablation of Ptdsr function.

These results must be interpreted very carefully, however, as it is technically difficult to unambiguously identify engulfed target cells in individual macrophages in solid tissues by fluorescence microscopy.

Interestingly, we observed differences between Ptdsr + / + and Ptdsr - / - macrophages in the secretion of pro - and anti - inflammatory cytokines after stimulation with LPS and apoptotic cells.

In the course of the study presented here, we stained immunohistochemically for Ptdsr with mAb 217G8E9 on wild - type and Ptdsr - deficient macrophages and fibroblasts ( see Additional data file 1, Figure S2 and data not shown).

For detection of apoptotic cells and macrophages, anti - aCasp3 ( an antibody specific for activated caspase 3; R & D Systems, Minneapolis, USA) and anti - F4 / 80 ( Serotec GmBH, D u sseldorf, Germany; # MCA 1957) antibodies were used as described by the supplier.

X - Vivo 15 medium ( Cambrex, East Rutherford, USA) was added to the resulting cell suspension, and after centrifugation ( 200 x g; 3 min) cells were resuspended in X - Vivo 15 medium supplemented with 50 ng / ml macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( M - CSF; Sigma - Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) and cultured on non - treated tissue - culture dishes at 37 degrees C with 5% CO2.

By 2 wk of age, Col2a1 expression was reduced in most cells of the articular region ( Figure 5L and 5Q), accompanied by markedly reduced Safranin O staining ( Figure 5K and 5P), and decreased expression of Agg and two genes normally expressed in more mature articular cartilage cells, Collagen 3 ( Col3a1) and Collagen 10 ( Col10a1) ( Figure 5M and 5R) ( unpublished data) ( Eyre 2002).

Instead, increased expression of Col10a1 was seen in a zone of largely LACZ - negative cells stretching from the cartilage adjacent to the ossification front ( where Col10a1 is normally expressed in maturing cartilage cells), toward the regions where surface articular cartilage was severely eroded or missing ( Figure 6A and 6B, arrowheads).

Somewhat paradoxically, several studies further demonstrate that treatment with anti - inflammatory drugs to reduce microglial activation actually lowers amyloid load in APP transgenic mice, suggesting a role for mouse microglia in the formation and maintenance of amyloid aggregates [ 41 - 43].	"microglial	116	126	Cell"	"microglia	219	228	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""microglial"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""microglia"", ""start_span"": 219, ""end_span"": 228, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Nonetheless, the role of microglia in both the human condition and the mouse models is poorly understood, and differences in microglial reactivity between the two could lead to significantly faster amyloid clearance in the brains of patients with AD than we observe in the tet - off APP mice.

Given the relatively minor role played by microglia in other mouse models of amyloidosis, we think it unlikely that these cells have influenced the rate of amyloid clearance in the tet - off APP mice.

While it is possible that dox acts in some other way to slow amyloid clearance, data from multiple studies demonstrate that microglial responses are normally weak in the mouse AD models [ 37 - 40], and thus it is doubtful that dox - mediated microglial inhibition affected the outcome of our study.

ES cells have two important properties: theability to maintain pluripotency, which is the ability to differentiate into a wide variety of cells, and rapid proliferation.

mr - s is preferentially expressed in the photoreceptors at postnatal day 3 - 6 ( P3 - 6), when photoreceptors undergo terminal differentiation, and in the adult pineal gland.

This production of different cell types at different times appears to derive from differences in the intrinsic properties of progenitor cells involved in the transcription or chromatin modification.

Two Otx family homeobox genes, Otx2 and Crx, play essential roles in early cell fate determination and terminal differentiation of photoreceptors [ 3, 8, 9].

Crx transcripts begin to be expressed in developing photoreceptors at embryonic day 12. 5 ( E12. 5) in the mouse and a strong upregulation of Crx transcription is apparent across the differentiating photoreceptors at postnatal day 6 ( P6).

Photoreceptor cells in the Crx knockout ( KO) mice exhibit a dramatic reduction of many photoreceptor molecules including visual pigments and develop neither photoreceptor outer segments nor a synaptic terminus [ 8, 10].

While Otx2 and Crx control general photoreceptor development, three other transcription factors, TR beta 2, Nrl, and Nr2e3 regulate the specification of photoreceptor cell types [ 4, 5, 7].

Although both Otx2 and Crx are expressed in developing photoreceptor cells in the embryonic retina, only Crx is highly expressed in the postnatal photoreceptors, suggesting that mr - s may be regulated by Crx.

This may be due to cell type differences because a cell type of retinal / pineal origin was not used in our luciferase assay.

To confirm self - association of the mr - s protein in mammalian cells, we next performed co - immunoprecipitation studies in HEK293T cells by co - transfection of HA - tagged full - length / truncated mr - s and Flag - tagged full - length / truncated mr - s ( Fig. 5A).

To determine the subcellular localization of mr - s in mammalian cells, we introduced an HA - tagged full - length mr - s plasmid into HEK293T cells.

However, luciferase activity was repressed by about 30% in Y79 cells, while it was repressed by 90% in HEK293T cells.

However, these in vitro experiments using HEK293T and Y79 cells strongly support our hypothesis that mr - s functions as a transcriptional repressor in developing photoreceptors.

However, unlike the in vivo TTD phenotypes described above, in which XpdTTD / TTD and XpdTTD / KO animals were indistinguishable, XpdTTD dosage effects were observed in UV survival, UV - UDS, and UV - RRS, indicating that cellular parameters as measured in fibroblasts here do not always correlate with the phenotype at the level of the intact organism.

XpdTTD / KO hemizygous cells were thus used as the baseline on which to compare the activity of compound heterozygous cells.	"cells	23	28	Cell"	"cells	118	123	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Relative to XpdTTD / KO hemizygote cells, UV survival was improved by the homozygous lethal Xpd + XPCS allele in XpdTTD / + XPCS compound heterozygous cells and to a lesser degree by the Xpd + XP allele ( Figure 4A).	"cells	35	40	Cell"	"cells	151	156	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 151, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
However, homozygous XPDXP ( XPDR683W) and hemizygous XPDXPCS ( XPDG602D) human cells are known to be highly sensitive to UV [ 19, 25], as are cells from a homozygous viable XpdXPCS / XPCS ( XPDG602D / G602D) mouse model ( Figure 4A, dotted line) [ 23].

Significant effects of compound heterozygosity on NER subpathways relative to XpdTTD / KO cells were observed in XpdTTD / + XP cells but only for UV - UDS activity.

The ~ 48% UV - UDS value presented in this study for XpdTTD / TTD cells differs from our previously published data of 25% UV - UDS [ 21], possibly because of the high variability intrinsic to the assay or routine variations in the cell culture conditions.	"cells	66	71	Cell"	"cell	231	235	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 231, ""end_span"": 235, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The Lepob mice have impaired platelet aggregation [ 26] and were evaluated as a reference for platelet function.	"platelet	29	37	Cell"	"platelet	94	102	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""platelet"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""platelet"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In contrast to the Lepob mice with a platelet defect and 10 - fold increase in bleeding time, there was no difference in the bleeding time between B6 and A / J mice and suggested platelet aggregation is not altered in these two strains.	"platelet	37	45	Cell"	"platelet	179	187	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""platelet"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""platelet"", ""start_span"": 179, ""end_span"": 187, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Mice that are deficient in factors required for normal platelet function, platelet glycoprotein Ib [ 30], and protease - activated receptor - 4, [ 31] have increased tail bleeding time.	"platelet	55	63	Cell"	"platelet	74	82	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""platelet"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""platelet"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The leptin deficiency with reduced platelet aggregation clearly shows a marked increase in bleeding time and the increased bleeding time in Plg - / - and uPA - / - mice suggests that Plg and uPA may exert an influence on platelet response to promote normal thrombus formation.	"platelet	35	43	Cell"	"platelet	221	229	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""platelet"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""platelet"", ""start_span"": 221, ""end_span"": 229, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In p150CAF - 1 mutant 16 - cell stage embryos, the altered organization of heterochromatin displays similarities to the structure of heterochromatin in two - to four - cell stage wild - type embryos, suggesting that CAF - 1 is required for the maturation of heterochromatin during preimplantation development.	"cell	27	31	Cell"	"cell	168	172	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 168, ""end_span"": 172, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Moreover, mutant embryos contained only eight to 16 cells at the E4 stage, instead of 32 cells observed for wild - type or heterozygous blastocysts ( Figure 1C and 1D).	"cells	52	57	Cell"	"cells	89	94	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
A loss of p150CAF - 1 staining could not be detected before the eight - cell stage ( unpublished data) suggesting that maternally contributed protein is present in the embryo up to the four - cell stage.	"cell	72	76	Cell"	"cell	192	196	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 192, ""end_span"": 196, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Heterochromatin domains are progressively assembled into DAPI - dense foci between the four - cell and 32 - cell blastocyst stages ( Figure 1F).	"cell	94	98	Cell"	"cell	108	112	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Next, we wondered whether a similar requirement for CAF - 1 could also be observed in ES cells, which are derived from the blastocyst inner cell mass.	"cells	89	94	Cell"	"cell	140	144	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
p150CAF - 1 RNAi - depleted ES cells displayed a phenotype very similar to the cells of Chaf1a - / - E4 mice.	"cells	31	36	Cell"	"cells	79	84	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
However, 24 h later, ES cells cease to proliferate and die, revealing that p150CAF - 1 is required for an essential cellular process, as in embryos.	"cells	24	29	Cell"	"cellular	116	124	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cellular"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Altogether, our data demonstrate that loss of p150CAF - 1 function in ES cells and early embryos alters first the organization of heterochromatin in the nucleus and, in a subsequent step, cell cycle and viability.	"cells	73	78	Cell"	"cell	188	192	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 188, ""end_span"": 192, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
To rule out the possibility that hypomethylation of pericentric repeats might contribute to the destabilization of heterochromatin domains in p150CAF - 1 - depleted ES cells, we tested our RNAi plasmid vector in a XY ES cell line, and confirmed that loss of p150CAF - 1 leads to disruption of heterochromatin organization independently of the degree of DNA methylation at pericentric repeats ( unpublished data).	"cells	168	173	Cell"	"cell	220	224	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 168, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 220, ""end_span"": 224, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Ultimately, p150CAF - 1 depletion results in the arrest of ES cell division and cell death.	"cell	62	66	Cell"	"cell	80	84	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Alternatively, early embryos and ES cells, whose genome is more plastic than somatic cells, might represent a particularly sensitive context in which the importance of CAF - 1 in heterochromatin organization is exacerbated.	"cells	36	41	Cell"	"cells	85	90	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In contrast, in undifferentiated cells that are already lineage committed ( such as MEFs) genome architecture might be more stable than in ES cells and thus cannot be disrupted by CAF - 1 depletion.	"cells	33	38	Cell"	"cells	142	147	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 147, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This drastic reorganization of heterochromatin organization is similar to that observed in p150CAF - 1 - depleted ES cells, and in developmentally arrested 16 - cell stage Chaf1a - / - embryos.	"cells	117	122	Cell"	"cell	161	165	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 161, ""end_span"": 165, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The apparent difference in the efficiency of CAF - 1 knockdown revealed by Western blot and IF likely reflects the observation that the RNAi plasmid vector used in this study is efficient in 85% of the transfected ES cell population, whereas 15% of cells display no inhibition of the target gene ( see Materials and Methods).

( C) Flow cytometry analysis showed a similar cell - cycle profile for control and p150CAF - 1 - depleted ES cells.

Rb - Mediated Neuronal Differentiation through Cell - Cycle - Independent Regulation of E2f3a	"Neuronal	14	22	Cell"	"Cell	47	51	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""Neuronal"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 22, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""Cell"", ""start_span"": 47, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Rb absence impairs cell cycle exit and triggers death of some neurons, so differentiation defects may well be indirect.

However, Rb - deficient starburst amacrine neurons differentiate abnormally even when E2f1 is removed, providing an unequivocal example of a direct role for Rb in neuronal differentiation.	"amacrine neurons	34	50	Cell"	"neuronal	163	171	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""amacrine neurons"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 163, ""end_span"": 171, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Rather than potentiating a cell - specific factor, Rb promotes starburst cell differentiation by inhibiting another E2f, E2f3a.	"cell	27	31	Cell"	"cell	73	77	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This cell - cycle - independent activity broadens the importance of the Rb - E2f pathway, and suggests we should reassess its role in the differentiation of other cell types.	"cell	5	9	Cell"	"cell	163	167	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 9, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 163, ""end_span"": 167, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The retinoblastoma protein ( Rb) is critical for cell cycle exit during retinal transition cell birth.	"cell	49	53	Cell"	"cell	91	95	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Rb controls the cell cycle by binding and inhibiting E2f transcription factors ( E2fs) ( Figure 1B), first defined as transcription factors that bind adenoviral E2 regulatory elements and subsequently shown to be critical cell cycle regulators [ 4, 5].	"cell	16	20	Cell"	"cell	222	226	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 222, ""end_span"": 226, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
E2f3b, like repressive E2fs, is present in both quiescent and dividing cells, and in quiescent fibroblasts it associates primarily with Rb, suggesting that it mediates repression [ 16 - 18].	"cells	71	76	Cell"	"fibroblasts	95	106	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""fibroblasts"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
When these defects were rescued, most retinal neurons, including rods, survived, differentiated, and functioned normally.	"neurons	46	53	Cell"	"rods	65	69	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""rods"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Defects in Rb null SACs correlated with specific E2f3 expression in these cells, and E2f3 expression was absent in neurons that differentiated without Rb.	"cells	74	79	Cell"	"neurons	115	122	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Thus, independent of E2f1 - mediated effects on division and death, Rb does regulate neuronal differentiation, but only in specific neurons and, unexpectedly, through E2f3a, not tissue - specific differentiation factors.	"neuronal	85	93	Cell"	"neurons	132	139	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neuronal"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Loss of Rb in the retina results in considerable RTC apoptosis, eliminating most bipolar and ganglion cells as well as many rods ( Figure 2A - 2D) [ 2, 3].	"bipolar and ganglion cells	81	107	Cell"	"rods	124	128	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""bipolar and ganglion cells"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""rods"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 128, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
( F) Further illustrates that the relative influence of the mutations on the photoreceptors ( indicated by the saturated a - wave amplitude, right graph) was not substantially different from their effect on the b - wave response ( dominated by the bipolars, left graph) at the same intensity of 10 cd. s / m2.	"photoreceptors	77	91	Cell"	"bipolars	248	256	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptors"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""bipolars"", ""start_span"": 248, ""end_span"": 256, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
It was suggested that Rb might regulate photoreceptor differentiation, possibly through rod - specific transcription factors ( Figure 1B) [ 29].	"photoreceptor	40	53	Cell"	"rod	88	91	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 91, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
However, if Rb does regulate photoreceptor differentiation, it does so by inhibiting E2f1, not by potentiating rod differentiation factors, such as Otx2, Crx, or Nrl.	"photoreceptor	29	42	Cell"	"rod	111	114	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptor"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This modest reduction of RPC numbers in the absence of E2f1 accounts for the slight reduction in the number of ganglion cells at P0, in the number of bipolar cells at P18 or P30, and in the thickness of the ONL at P18 or P30 in the E2f1 KO and Rb / E2f1 DKO retina ( Figure 2B - 2D).	"ganglion cells	111	125	Cell"	"bipolar cells	150	163	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""ganglion cells"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""bipolar cells"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 163, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Despite a slight drop in absolute cell numbers, the proportion of Rb / E2f1 DKO and E2f1 KO bipolar cells was the same as WT ( data not shown).	"cell	34	38	Cell"	"bipolar cells	92	105	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 38, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""bipolar cells"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Typically, an ERG signal begins with a negative deflection initiated by the photoreceptors ( the a - wave), which is terminated by a large positive deflection due to the activation of ON bipolar cells ( the b - wave).	"photoreceptors	76	90	Cell"	"ON bipolar cells	184	200	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""photoreceptors"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""ON bipolar cells"", ""start_span"": 184, ""end_span"": 200, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The photopic response, a product of cone and mainly bipolar activity, was much reduced by Rb loss, but was rescued considerably in the Rb / E2f1 DKO retina ( Figure S5).	"cone	36	40	Cell"	"bipolar	52	59	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""bipolar"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The photopic response in E2f1 KO mice was slightly reduced relative to WT ( Figure S5B), possibly because E2f1 is required for maximal expansion of embryonic RPCs, and the E2f1 KO retina has, as noted earlier, slightly fewer cells than the WT retina, although cell type proportions are unaffected ( D. C. and R. B., unpublished data).	"cells	225	230	Cell"	"cell	260	264	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 225, ""end_span"": 230, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 260, ""end_span"": 264, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
"Thus, marginally subnormal photopic responses in the Rb / E2f1 DKO retina can be attributed to both a reduction of cone numbers in E2f1 KO mice alone, and a "" genuine "" slight reduction in cone function attributable to Rb loss relative to WT."	"cone	115	119	Cell"	"cone	189	193	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 189, ""end_span"": 193, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Thus, E2f1 deletion not only rescues morphology but also both rod and cone system function in the Rb KO retina.	"rod	62	65	Cell"	"cone	70	74	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""rod"", ""start_span"": 62, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cone"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Camk2a marks both SACs and ganglion cells [ 37], but because ganglion cells are eliminated in the Rb KO retina, Camk2a is a specific SAC marker in this context.	"ganglion cells	27	41	Cell"	"ganglion cells	61	75	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""ganglion cells"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""ganglion cells"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
The latter fraction is higher than WT because ganglion cells, which normally make up ~ 40% of Camk2a + cells, are killed by apoptosis.	"ganglion cells	46	60	Cell"	"cells	103	108	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""ganglion cells"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This marker is expressed in both SACs and ganglion cells, thus Isl1 + cells in the INL are exclusively SACs [ 49].	"ganglion cells	42	56	Cell"	"cells	70	75	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""ganglion cells"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
At P0, no WT Isl1 + cells in the inner neuroblastic layer ( NBL) ( which is the future INL) were dividing, but 57 +/- 14 Isl1 + / Mki67 + cells were detected in the Rb KO inner NBL ( Figure 4D).

As the retina differentiated and RPC division diminished, the number of E2f3 + cells also dropped, and by P8, when division is virtually over, only a subset of post - mitotic cells in the inner retina expressed E2f3 ( Figure 5A).

Rb protein was also detected in the inner retina ( Figure 5A), and showed a similar distribution as E2f3 in SACs ( Figure 5B), and was also present in mature ganglion cells and M u ller cells as reported [ 51].

In agreement, we could not detect defects in cholinergic Rb KO neurons in the developing forebrain, but other Rb KO neurons in this region showed differentiation defects that were rescued by deleting E2f3 [ 53].

Thus, separate from its role in cell cycle control, Rb regulation of E2f3a is critical to ensure proper neuronal differentiation.

Work in the early 1990s showed that Rb loss triggers defects in neuronal cell cycle exit, survival, and differentiation [ 26 - 28].

In any case, it is clear that in most retinal cells, including photoreceptors [ 29], transcription factors that promote differentiation function independently of Rb.	"cells	46	51	Cell"	"photoreceptors	63	77	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""photoreceptors"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
These data are consistent with the observation that E2f1 overexpression in newborn photoreceptors drives ectopic division and apoptosis [ 60], and add to the growing evidence indicating that E2f1 is the major, and perhaps only, member of the three activating E2fs required to induce apoptosis in Rb KO cells [ 10, 15].

Early overexpression studies in vitro suggested Rb might temper expansion of cycling cells, but KO studies in vivo indicate that its major role is to block division in terminally differentiating cells.

In brain, Rb KO neurons migrate away from the ventricular zone and switch on Tubb3 ( beta III - tubulin), but continue to incorporate BrdU [ 13], and in gut epithelia, differentiated enterocytes migrate up the villi and activate expression of serotonin, yet continue to incorporate BrdU [ 67].

It may be difficult to identify E2f3a - specific target genes or cytoplasmic proteins in SACs since these neurons are a small proportion ( < 1%) of the total retina and only ~ 5. 2% of amacrine neurons [ 38].	"neurons	106	113	Cell"	"amacrine neurons	185	201	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""amacrine neurons"", ""start_span"": 185, ""end_span"": 201, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Others have suggested that Rb promotes differentiation in non - neuronal cells through E2f - independent means [ 31 - 33].

Bin 1 contains only cells that expressed Cre as progenitors; bin 3 is at central retina and contains cells derived from progenitors that did not express Cre.
