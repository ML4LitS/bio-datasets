Normal differentiation of lens fiber cells consists of a progression from a simple cuboidal epithelial cell, containing a nucleus and a minimal numbers of organelles, to a stratified layer of elongated fiber - like cells, devoid of nuclei and organelles.

The final biological event in a lens epithelial cell ' s life is the transformation from an epithelial cell into a fiber cell, which occurs at the equatorial / bow region of the lens.

The newly forming fiber cell continues to differentiate in the cortex until a mature fiber cell devoid of organelles with suture formation at the ends of the cell is formed.

In addition, hsp expression has been shown to accompany growth arrest in human B lymphocytes [ 27] and macrophage differentiation of HL 60 cells [ 28].

Hematopoiesis involves the coordinated processes of cell proliferation and differentiation of a relatively small number of progenitor cells into billions of circulating red and white blood cells ( Thisse and Zon 2002).

The mon mutants initiate expression of gata1 in hematopoietic cells around the five - somite stage, similar to wild - type embryos ( data not shown); however, based on TUNEL staining, the differentiating erythroid cells undergo programmed cell death from the 12 - somite stage to 22 h postfertilization ( hpf) ( Figure 1A and 1B, arrows).

At 4 d of development, 70% ( n = 10) of montg234 mutants show significant ( greater than 200 cells in comparison to a wild - type estimate of 3, 000 cells) rescue of circulating hemoglobinized RBCs in comparison to control sibling mutants ( n = 75).

The high levels of tif1 gamma expression in erythroid cells suggest that it functions as a cell - autonomous regulator of gene expression in hematopoietic cells.	"erythroid cells	44	59	Cell"	"cell	91	95	Cell"	"hematopoietic cells	141	160	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""erythroid cells"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""hematopoietic cells"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 160, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Of 81 recipients initially scored as having less than ten GFP + cells at day 2 posttransplant, 13 ( 16%) of these demonstrated a marked increase in erythroid cells with 100 - 1, 000 GFP + cells in circulation 6 d later.

Therefore, the results of cell transplantations suggests that tif1 gamma plays a cell - autonomous role in erythroid cells, and its role in nonhematopoietic tissues, such as trunk mesenchyme or the nervous system, is also required for embryo survival.	"cell	26	30	Cell"	"cell	81	85	Cell"	"erythroid cells	107	122	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""erythroid cells"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We next examined the expression of Tif1 gamma protein during the differentiation of G1E cells, a murine erythroleukemia cell line that can terminally differentiate into erythrocytes when a Gata1: estrogen receptor fusion protein is stabilized in response to estrogen exposure ( Weiss et al. 1997).

Moreover, Ptdsr is not required for apoptotic cell clearance by macrophages but seems to be necessary for the regulation of macrophage cytokine responses.	"apoptotic cell	36	50	Cell"	"macrophages	64	75	Cell"	"macrophage	124	134	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""apoptotic cell"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""macrophage"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is required for the normal development of almost all multicellular organisms and is a physiological mechanism for controlling cell number; as a result, structures that are no longer needed are deleted during development and abnormal cells are eliminated [ 1, 2].	"cell	11	15	Cell"	"cell	95	99	Cell"	"cells	270	275	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 270, ""end_span"": 275, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Almost all cell types can recognize, respond to, and ingest apoptotic cells by using specific sets of phagocytic receptors that bind to specific ligands on apoptotic cells.	"cell	11	15	Cell"	"apoptotic cells	60	75	Cell"	"apoptotic cells	156	171	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 156, ""end_span"": 171, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
These data supported the hypothesis that Ptdsr fulfils a role as a crucial signaling switch after the engagement of macrophages with apoptotic cells and is thereby fundamental for preventing local immune responses to apoptotic cells before their clearance [ 28].	"macrophages	116	127	Cell"	"apoptotic cells	133	148	Cell"	"apoptotic cells	217	232	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 217, ""end_span"": 232, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This suggests that at this stage of development it is mainly neighboring cells that are involved in removal of apoptotic cells, rather than professional macrophages.	"cells	73	78	Cell"	"apoptotic cells	111	126	Cell"	"macrophages	153	164	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 153, ""end_span"": 164, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In summary, our analysis in vivo did not reveal any impairment in apoptotic cell clearance in Ptdsr - deficient embryos during development and further suggests that phagocytosis of apoptotic cells is mainly mediated by non - professional ' bystander ' cells.	"apoptotic cell	66	80	Cell"	"apoptotic cells	181	196	Cell"	"cells	252	257	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""apoptotic cell"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 181, ""end_span"": 196, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 252, ""end_span"": 257, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
To determine whether macrophages from Ptdsr - knockout mice were impaired in the efficacy of apoptotic cell uptake in vitro, we performed phagocytosis assays with fetal - liver - derived macrophages ( FLDMs) and quantified their phagocytosis rates.	"macrophages	21	32	Cell"	"apoptotic cell	93	107	Cell"	"macrophages	187	198	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cell"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 187, ""end_span"": 198, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Analysis of phagocytosis rates by flow cytometric analysis ( FACS) revealed no differences in the efficacy of apoptotic cell uptake between Ptdsr - / - and Ptdsr + / + macrophages and demonstrated no differences in apoptotic cell engulfment between selected time points ( data not shown).	"apoptotic cell	110	124	Cell"	"macrophages	168	179	Cell"	"apoptotic cell	215	229	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""apoptotic cell"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 168, ""end_span"": 179, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cell"", ""start_span"": 215, ""end_span"": 229, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Moreover, single Ptdsr - / - macrophages could be identified that had engulfed even more apoptotic target cells than had wild - type macrophages ( Figure 7b, d).	"macrophages	29	40	Cell"	"apoptotic target cells	89	111	Cell"	"macrophages	133	144	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic target cells"", ""start_span"": 89, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In addition to its suggested importance for phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, it has been proposed that Ptdsr fulfils a second crucial role in regulating and maintaining a non - inflammatory environment upon the recognition of apoptotic cells by macrophages [ 26].	"apoptotic cells	60	75	Cell"	"apoptotic cells	226	241	Cell"	"macrophages	245	256	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 226, ""end_span"": 241, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 245, ""end_span"": 256, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
To analyze whether TNF - alpha release by Ptdsr - / - macrophages can be affected by engulfment of apoptotic cells, we stimulated FLDMs with LPS, apoptotic cells or both.	"macrophages	54	65	Cell"	"apoptotic cells	99	114	Cell"	"apoptotic cells	146	161	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 161, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Quantification of TNF - alpha levels by ELISA after 22 h showed that Ptdsr - deficient macrophages release less TNF - alpha after stimulation with LPS alone, and also after double stimulation of macrophages with LPS and apoptotic cells ( Figure 8d).	"macrophages	87	98	Cell"	"macrophages	195	206	Cell"	"apoptotic cells	220	235	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 195, ""end_span"": 206, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 220, ""end_span"": 235, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
Moreover, the double stimulation demonstrated that the LPS - induced TNF - alpha release by Ptdsr - / - macrophages could be inhibited by co - administration of apoptotic cells to an extent comparable to that seen in wild - type macrophages.	"macrophages	104	115	Cell"	"apoptotic cells	161	176	Cell"	"macrophages	229	240	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 104, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 161, ""end_span"": 176, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 229, ""end_span"": 240, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In addition, our data suggest that during embryogenesis, macrophage - mediated clearance of apoptotic cells is not the only - or even the primary - mechanism for the removal of apoptotic cells.	"macrophage	57	67	Cell"	"apoptotic cells	92	107	Cell"	"apoptotic cells	177	192	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""macrophage"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 67, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 177, ""end_span"": 192, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
In many tissues where programmed cell death occurs as a prominent event during embryogenesis, such as remodeling of the genital ridge during gonad morphogenesis and differentiation of the neural tube, we found almost no co - localization of apoptotic cells and macrophages.	"cell	33	37	Cell"	"apoptotic cells	241	256	Cell"	"macrophages	261	272	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 241, ""end_span"": 256, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 261, ""end_span"": 272, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This indicates that in these cases clearance of apoptotic cells is directly mediated by neighboring ' bystander ' cells rather than by macrophages that have been recruited into areas where apoptosis occurs.	"apoptotic cells	48	63	Cell"	"cells	114	119	Cell"	"macrophages	135	146	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""apoptotic cells"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cells"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""macrophages"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
We performed phagocytosis assays in vitro with fetal - liver - derived macrophages, while in their assays, Li and colleagues used thioglycollate - elicited peritoneal macrophages after adoptive transfer of Ptdsr - / - hematopoietic stem cells.

We do not think that the different results observed in Ptdsr - knockout mice in a mixed C57BL / 6 x 129 background and in a pure C57BL / 6J background can be attributed to genetic background effects: comparison of apoptotic cell engulfment efficacies of thioglycollate - elicited macrophages from 129P2 / OlaHsd and C57BL / 6J mice did not show any differences in apoptotic cell uptake ( J. B. and A. L., unpublished observations).

For preparation of apoptotic target cells, primary thymocytes were harvested from the thymus of 4 - to 8 - week - old C57BL / 6J mice, stained with TAMRA for 15 min, and apoptosis was induced either by treating cells with 5 mu M staurosporine in medium for 4 h at 37 degrees C or by culturing cells in medium overnight.

The few large Safranin O - stained cells still apparent in mutant articular regions appeared to correspond in position to rare LACZ - negative cells in adjacent sections, suggesting that Bmpr1a is required cell - autonomously in articular cartilage ( Figure 7I and 7J, white arrowheads).

Removing E2f1 rescues aberrant division of differentiating Rb - deficient retinal neurons, as well as death in cells prone to apoptosis, and restores both normal differentiation and function of major cell types, such as photoreceptors.

Its development proceeds through three overlapping steps starting with retinal progenitor cell ( RPC) proliferation, followed by birth of post - mitotic retinal transition cells ( RTCs, also referred to as precursors), and ending with terminal differentiation of seven major cell types ( Figure 1A) [ 1].

This is easily detected at E14, E16, and postnatal day ( P) 0 in the inner retina where abnormal BrdU + ganglion and amacrine RTCs are located, or on the outermost region of the P0 retina, where BrdU + photoreceptor RTCs reside ( Figures S1A and S2, arrows) [ 2].

Rb binds more than 100 proteins [ 43] and in some non - neuronal cells, such as skeletal muscle, adipocytes, and bone, Rb is thought to bind and potentiate tissue - specific transcription factors that promote differentiation [ 31 - 33].

The unique effect of E2f3 in disrupting the differentiation of SACs but not other retinal neurons might be due to cell - type - specific expression or cell - type - specific activity of E2f3.	"neurons	90	97	Cell"	"cell	114	118	Cell"	"cell	151	155	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 151, ""end_span"": 155, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
For example, in the P20 amygdala, E2f3 colocalized with the general neuronal markers Mtap2 and Mecp2 [ 52], but not with Calb2, which marks a subset of neurons, or with the glial marker Gfap ( data not shown).

E2f3a can trigger cell cycle induction, but because SAC defects are not linked to cell cycle perturbation ( Figures 3A and 4), and in view of the predominant association between E2f3b and Rb in quiescent cells [ 16, 19], we suspected that E2f3b may perturb differentiation in Rb KO SACs.

However, targeted KO and chimeric studies reveal that Rb autonomously promotes cell cycle exit in newborn neurons, and is required for survival of a subset of neurons, particularly in the retina [ 2, 3, 13, 14, 56 - 59].	"cell	79	83	Cell"	"neurons	106	113	Cell"	"neurons	159	166	Cell"	"[{""token"": ""cell"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Cell""}, {""token"": ""neurons"", ""start_span"": 159, ""end_span"": 166, ""type"": ""Cell""}]"
This difference might reflect a role for Rb in the development of cones, bipolar cells, or other cells that may contribute to the photopic ERG, including potentially SACs, which do have a serious defect in the Rb / E2f1 DKO retina.

Rb binds more than 100 factors [ 43], and in several non - neuronal cells, such as skeletal muscle, adipocytes, and bone, it binds and potentiates tissue - specific transcription factors that promote differentiation [ 31 - 33].
