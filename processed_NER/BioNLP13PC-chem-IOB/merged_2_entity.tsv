ATM also contains a proline - rich region and a leucine zipper, both of which implicate this protein in signal transduction.	proline,20,27,Chemical	leucine,48,55,Chemical	"[{""token"": ""proline"", ""start_span"": 20, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""leucine"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"	test
In prokaryotes both of them are found in polysaccharides of the cell wall, while in animals only L - fucose has been described, which mainly participates to the structure of glycoconjugates, either in the cell membrane or secreted in biological fluids, such as ABH blood groups and Lewis system antigens.	polysaccharides,41,56,Chemical	L - fucose,97,107,Chemical	"[{""token"": ""polysaccharides"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Chemical""}, {""token"": ""L - fucose"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"	test
These compounds are then the substrates of specific glycosyltransferases which are responsible for insertion of either L - fucose or L - rhamnose in the corresponding glycoconjugates.
