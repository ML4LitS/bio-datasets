Since the optimal pH for processing was between 7 and 8, and E - 64 ( a cysteine protease inhibitor) and leupeptin ( a serine and cysteine protease inhibitor) both inhibited this processing by cell lysates, we hypothesized that a calcium - activated neutral protease, CANP, might be responsible for this processing.
