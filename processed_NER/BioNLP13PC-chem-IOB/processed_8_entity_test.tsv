The inability of the competitive inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase N ( G) - monometyl - L - arginine ( 20 and 200 microM) to revert Tat action on forskolin - induced cAMP accumulation, and of two potent nitric oxide donors, PAPA and DETA ( 0. 1 - 2 m M), to alter forskolin - induced cAMP accumulation, excluded an involvement of nitric oxide in Tat - induced adenylyl cyclase inhibition.
