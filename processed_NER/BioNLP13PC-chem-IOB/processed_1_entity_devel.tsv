Analysis of chemical shift changes reveals the binding modes of isoindolinone inhibitors of the MDM2 - p53 interaction.	"isoindolinone	64	77	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""isoindolinone"", ""start_span"": 64, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
In this study we present a method for defining the binding modes of a set of structurally related isoindolinone inhibitors of the MDM2 - p53 interaction.	"isoindolinone	98	111	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""isoindolinone"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"

Isoindolinones are a novel class of MDM2 - antagonists of moderate affinity, which still require the development of more potent candidates for clinical applications.	"Isoindolinones	0	14	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""Isoindolinones"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
For a set of 12 structurally related isoindolinones, the data suggests 4 different orientations of binding, caused by subtle changes in the chemical structure of the inhibitors.

This limonoid abrogated the expression of proteins associated with cell survival ( Bcl - 2, Bcl - xL, IAP - 1, and IAP - 2), proliferation ( cyclin D1), invasion ( MMP - 9), and angiogenesis ( VEGF), all regulated by nuclear factor ( NF) - kappaB.	"limonoid	5	13	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""limonoid"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
We found that suppression of NF - kappaB activation by nimbolide was caused by inhibition of IkappaB kinase ( IKK), which led to suppression of IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and degradation, nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and gene transcription.	"nimbolide	55	64	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""nimbolide"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
Overall, our results indicate that nimbolide can sensitize tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents through interaction with IKK, leading to inhibition of NF - kappaB - regulated proteins.

The results indicated that treatment with oroxylin A inhibited NF - kappaB p65 nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha and IKKalpha / beta in both human colon tumor HCT116 cells and human monocytes THP - 1 cells.	"oroxylin A	42	52	Chemical"	"[{""token"": ""oroxylin A"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Chemical""}]"
