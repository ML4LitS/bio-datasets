Expression of both the full - length and epitope - tagged soluble forms of the putative enzyme in human 293T cells generated core 1 beta3 - Gal - T activity that transferred galactose from UDP - Gal to GalNAcalpha1 - O - phenyl, and a synthetic glycopeptide with Thr - linked GalNAc and the product was shown to have the core 1 structure.
