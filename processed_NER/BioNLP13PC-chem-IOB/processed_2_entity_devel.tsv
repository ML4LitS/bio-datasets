Phosphatidylinositol - 4 - phosphate 5 - kinases ( PIP5Ks) utilize phosphatidylinositols containing D - 3 - position phosphates as substrates to form phosphatidylinositol 3, 4 - bisphosphate.

Kinase activities toward the 3 - position phosphoinositides are comparable with those seen with phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate as the substrate.

Whereas noninduced transfected cells showed virtually no uptake of [ 3H] taurocholate, taurocholate uptake by induced cells was Na + - independent and saturable ( Km = 19. 4 + / - 3. 3 microM; Vmax = 62. 2 + / - 1. 4 pmol / min / mg protein; n = 3).
