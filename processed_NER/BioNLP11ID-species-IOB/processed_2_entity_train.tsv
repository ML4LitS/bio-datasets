We undertook the present study to understand and to assess more accurately the genome - wide transcriptional responses of streptococci during one of the earliest recognized stages of infection, namely adherence to human pharyngeal cells.

Although few studies have examined gene expression patterns during adherence, SpeB production ( as detected by Western blot analysis) decreases during co - culture with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells [ 30] and in a mouse infection model [ 31].

To determine if SpeH plays a direct role in the adherence process, we created a deletion mutant in strain SF370 ( SF370DeltaspeH), which was confirmed by PCR ( unpublished data) and RT - PCR ( Figure 1A) and tested in vitro for adherence to human pharyngeal cells.

Recently, it was reported that the four genes spanning spy0127 - 0130 encode, and are responsible for, the formation of surface - localized, trypsin - resistant pili that induce protective immunity against a lethal dose of group A streptococci in a mouse model of infection [ 36].

Nonetheless, neighbor clustering provided a more comprehensive view of the transcriptome of group A streptococci during adherence to human pharyngeal cells, a critical step in the infection program of this organism.

Whereas the attenuation of BCG is due mainly to loss of the ESAT - 6 secretion system, ESX - 1, the reason why H37Ra is attenuated remained unknown.

"As H37Ra is derived from the same parent strain as M. tuberculosis H37Rv ( "" v "" for virulent) ( H37Rv), the sequenced paradigm strain of tuberculosis research [ 7], genomic comparisons of the attenuated and virulent variants of M. tuberculosis H37 are particularly interesting and have the potential to identify subtle genetic changes that might be responsible for the phenotypic differences observed between the two strains."

A number of overlapping cosmid clones that gave enhanced growth and survival in the spleens of infected mice relative to that of wild - type H37Ra were identified [ 9].

Microarray - Based Comparative Genome Sequencing of M. tuberculosis H37Ra The genome - wide comparative mutational analysis of H37Ra and H37Rv was carried out by NimbleGen Systems following a previously published method [ 13].	"H37Ra	68	73	Organism"	"H37Rv	137	142	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""H37Rv"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 142, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
By this combined approach we identified 13 non - synonymous SNPs that differed between the H37Ra and H37Rv strains used ( Table S1).	"H37Ra	91	96	Organism"	"H37Rv	101	106	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""H37Rv"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Nevertheless, the S129L mutation in PhoP, which we consider an important SNP involved in the attenuation and reduced immunogenicity of H37Ra, is identical in all H37Ra strains.

Clones spanning the different genomic regions of non - synonymous SNPs were selected from an ordered H37Rv library of integrating shuttle cosmids [ 7, 19] and individually electroporated into H37Ra, where they inserted stably into the attB site.

It is clearly visible that at nucleotide position 656 of phoP two peaks exist, one originating from the SNP present in H37Ra and one from the integrated cosmid I36 carrying the H37Rv wild - type copy of phoP.

As depicted in Figure S2, hybridization of SpeI - digested genomic DNA with a 32P labeled phoP probe resulted in two bands of different sizes, one corresponding to the SpeI fragment harboring the H37Ra phoP gene ( 50 kb), and the other to the larger SpeI fragment created by integration of the I36 cosmid into the genome of H37Ra at the attB site.

As depicted in Figure 1, macrophages were able to control ex vivo growth of H37Ra, but failed to control growth of H37Rv, confirming results from Freeman and colleagues [ 20].

From these experiments we concluded that complementation of H37Ra with the phoP wild - type copy partially restored its virulence, but not to the extent of the fully virulent H37Rv strain.

Complementation of H37Ra with the PhoP - expressing cosmid increased the virulence of the H37Ra:: phoP recombinant relative to H37Ra, resulting in a 1. 0 log and 0. 5 log increase in CFU number in lungs and spleens, respectively.

Together with the data from the macrophage infection assay, the results from the mouse infection show that the S219L mutation in the phoP gene definitely represents one genetic lesion that contributed to the attenuation of the H37Ra strain.

Figure 4A shows that infection of BM - DC with H37Ra or H37Ra:: rpsL induced no stimulation of the hybridoma as judged by IL - 2 production, while H37Ra:: phoP or H37Rv triggered high amounts of IL - 2 production in this very sensitive and specific test.

Firstly, we constructed a partially diploid H37Ra knock - in strain carrying cosmid RD1 - ppe68 - ko that, in BCG yields the greatest amounts of ESAT - 6 expression and secretion [ 24].

Together, our findings correlate perfectly with the in vivo data described above and suggest that the lack of ESAT - 6 specific T cell recognition for H37Ra, H37Ra:: fadE5, H37Ra:: rpsL, and SO2 is not caused by a loss of ESAT - 6 expression, but rather due to a failure of ( phoP dependent) ESAT - 6 secretion.

The observation that knocking - in the ESX - 1 region of H37Rv into H37Ra ( H37Ra:: RD1 - ppe68 - ko), and the resultant diploidy, did not improve the ESAT - 6 - specific T cell responses ( Figure 3B), further argues that PhoP - dependent ESAT - secretion might be regulated via a mechanism that lies outside the RD1 region.

We confirmed the trend that rv3614c was expressed much lower in H37Ra compared to H37Rv by qRT - PCR ( Figure 6), whereas expression of rv3614c in H37Ra:: phoP was restored to wild - type levels, suggesting that the rv3612c - rv3616c gene cluster is regulated by PhoP.

Interestingly, expression of phoP was higher in H37Ra than in H37Rv ( Figure 6).

The attenuated H37Ra strain was obtained at the Trudeau Institute in the 1930s in an attempt to dissociate virulent and avirulent forms of the tubercle bacillus H37.

Although these different H37 daughter strains have been available for many years now and belong to the standard strain collections of almost every tuberculosis diagnostic or research laboratory in the world [ 30, 31], the genetic basis of the decreased virulence of H37Ra remained unknown.

The identification of the amino acid change S219L in the predicted DNA binding region of the C - terminal effector domain of PhoP [ 15, 22] in H37Ra was therefore a particularly exciting finding that has the potential to explain part of the attenuation of the H37Ra strain and to elucidate the PhoP / PhoR associated complex regulatory network in M. tuberculosis.

These transcriptome data corroborate our results obtained by quantitative RT - PCR using probe rv3614c, which showed that gene rv3614c was definitely expressed much lower in H37Ra than in H37Rv and H37Ra:: phoP strains ( Figure 6).

Since in previous, independent studies it has been demonstrated that functions of the rv3614c - rv3616c ( espA) gene cluster were essential for the secretion of ESAT - 6 and CFP - 10 [ 27, 28], it is quite probable that the lack of ESAT - 6 - specific T cell responses observed for strains H37Ra and SO2 ( Figure 3) might be caused by the insufficient expression of rv3612c - rv3616c, which results from the lack of a fully functional PhoP in these strains.

Construction of such strains has recently been initiated as a first step of a future study to gain deeper insight into signaling events and regulation of the ESX - 1 secretion system in different tubercle bacilli, including members of the putative progenitor species Mycobacterium prototuberculosis [ 40].

As in previous DNA / DNA microarray analyses [ 10], and from inspection of the very recently released genome sequence of H37Ra, no significant differences in the ESX - 1 encoding region were found, the assumption that the observed lack of ESAT - 6 secretion in H37Ra may be caused by factors outside of the RD1 region is very plausible.

In contrast, in another transcriptome analysis, Mostowy and colleagues [ 11] found several genes of the RD1 region, including that encoding ESAT - 6, among the genes that were at least 2. 5 - fold lower expressed in H37Ra than in H37Rv.

Indeed, preliminary comparison of the 4. 4 - Mb genome of H37Rv [ 7] ( NC _ 000962) with the recently accessible H37Ra genome ( NC _ 009525) revealed 194 differences, including 126 SNPs, 16 deletions, 27 insertions, and 25 substitutions.

At present, we do not know how many of these differences actually contribute to the attenuation of H37Ra, and it also remains to be determined how many differences exist among the various H37Ra strains that are presently used in the worldwide tuberculosis research laboratories.

In addition, the genetic overlap unravelled a two - component system that is unique for the genera Photorhabdus and Yersinia and is therefore suggested to play a major role in the pathogen - insect relationship.

This suggests that P. luminescens does not produce its own AHL signalling molecule, but might be able to sense those produced by other bacteria and therefore to detect mixed microbial communities as demonstrated for Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli [ 35 - 37].

VAS - dependent secretion has been found to be important for virulence of Vibrio cholerae [ 92] as well as for Pseudomonas aeruginosa [ 93], and T6SS are assumed to play a major role in virulence in many Gram - negative bacteria [ 91].

We show here that graRS deletion considerably alters bacterial surface charge, increases susceptibility to killing by human neutrophils or the defense peptide LL - 37, and attenuates virulence of S. aureus in a mouse infection model.

The characteristic of invasive GAS infections has been thought to attribute to genetic changes in bacteria, however, no clear evidence has shown due to lack of an intriguingly study using serotype - matched isolates from clinical severe invasive GAS infections.

Herein we report that a panel of serotype - matched GAS, which were clinically isolated from severe invasive but not from non - invaive infections, could abrogate functions of human polymorphnuclear neutrophils ( PMN) in at least two independent ways; due to inducing necrosis to PMN by enhanced production of a pore - forming toxin streptolysin O ( SLO) and due to impairment of PMN migration via digesting interleukin - 8, a PMN attracting chemokine, by increased production of a serine protease ScpC.

However, GAS which lack either SLO or ScpC exhibit much less mortality than the csrS - mutated parent invasive GAS isolate to the infected mice.

These results suggest that the abilities of GAS to abrogate PMN functions can determine the onset and severity of invasive GAS infection.

Recently, GAS with diverse emm genotypes, especially, emm49 - genotype, have been isolated from patients of severe invasive GAS infections since 2000; however, these genotypes were not isolated before 1999 in Japan [ 8].

Epidemiological and pathological findings, including sporadic incidents of severe invasive GAS infections [ 9], high frequency of severe invasive infections in immunocompromised host [ 9], and aggregation of bacteria and a paucity of polymorphnuclear neutrophils ( PMN) in foci of invasive GAS infection [ 10] suggest that host defense factors play an important role in the onset of invasive infections.

These findings led us to postulate that invasive GAS infections hampered host innate immune defense, especially on PMN, providing the front - line defense against GAS infection by quick recruitment to infection site and clearance of bacteria following phagocytosis [ 11], [ 12].

So far, using animal - passaged GAS mutants, gene - manipulated GAS, many virulence - associated molecules are pointed out to play some roles in the bacterial evasion from phagocytic ingestion by neutrophils [ 13].

In the present study, we aimed to explore the crucial factors in the pathogenesis of severe invasive GAS infections in the context of PMN - GAS relationship, using a panel of emm49 clinical isolates from patients with or without severe invasive infection, and their gene - manipulated mutants.

We further determined CsrS mutations in the severe invasive GAS was essential to control the expression of various virulence genes and contributed to the in vivo virulence and disease - specific pathophysiology in a mouse model.

These data may participate in prediction of GAS potential for future invasive infection as well as risk assessment of patients by measuring PMN function.

However, as shown in Figure 1B, in vitro killing assay revealed that PMN killed non - invasive GAS, resulting in 15 - 42% of initial number of bacteria, but not invasive GAS ( p = 0. 019).	"non - invasive GAS	80	98	Organism"	"invasive GAS	161	173	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""non - invasive GAS"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""invasive GAS"", ""start_span"": 161, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These data indicated that clinically isolated severe invasive GAS were phagocytosed, but escaped from killing by human PMN.

Flow cytometry analysis suggested that although PMN was detected in the lower well consisted of IL - 8 and severe invasive GAS, but most of them were dead as defined by propidium iodine staining ( p = 0. 016) ( Figure 2A and 2C) demonstrating that severe invasive GAS affected survival of PMN and its migration activity in a transwell system.

Therefore, to know the mechanism underlying GAS - mediated killing of PMN, we investigated whether SLO produced by invasive GAS affect survival of PMN in an in vitro migration assay system.	"GAS	44	47	Organism"	"invasive GAS	115	127	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""GAS"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""invasive GAS"", ""start_span"": 115, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Furthermore, an SLO deficient mutant from a STSS isolate NIH230 ( NIH230slo) lost the killing activity for PMN ( Figure 3A), thereby, strongly suggesting that SLO is a key element for PMN killing mediated by invasive GAS.

Contrarily, SLS - deficient mutant from NIH230 strain ( NIH230sagA) killed PMN, as efficiently as did parent strain, indicating that SLS is dispensable for killing of PMN mediated by invasive GAS.

SLO and SLS double mutant GAS from NIH230 strain ( NIH230slosagA) displayed the killing activity indistinguishable from that of NIH230slo, confirming the primarily role of SLO for GAS - mediated PMN killing.

To confirm that SLO activity is increased in invasive GAS strain, we measured SLO hemolytic activity of GAS strains used in this study.

As shown in Figure 3C, SLO activity of severe invasive isolate NIH230 is increased as twice as that of non - invasive strain 1566 ( p = 0. 017).

Therefore, we quantified the amount of IL - 8 in culture before and after co - culture with clinically isolated GAS or its mutants.

Figure 4B shows that the amount of IL - 8 was significantly reduced by 60 - min co - culture with NIH230, as well as NIH230slo, but not with non - invasive GAS 1556.

The expression of the other virulence - associated genes, such as IgG degrading protease of GAS, Mac - 1 - like protein ( mac), nicotine adenine dinucleotide glycohydrolase ( nga), polysaccharide capsule production ( hasA), and C5a peptidase ( scpA), was also upregulted in the severe invasive GAS, greater than that detected in the non - invasive GAS ( Figure 5A).

Contrarily, the levels of streptococcal pyrogenic endotoxin ( speB), SLS ( sagA), and mitogenic factor ( speF) genes were downregulated in the severe invasive GAS, compared to that found in the non - invasive GAS ( Figure 5A and data not shown).

GAS isolates from mice with severe invasive disease had mutations in csrS, raising the notion that CsrR / S function is important in modulating gene expression during infection.

In order to clarify the role of CsrS regarding expression of the virulence - associated genes and resistance to PMN killing, we introduced the intact csrS gene of the 1566 strain into the severe invasive GAS ( see Figure 5A).

In parallel with the expression profile of slo and scpC in the severe invasive GAS, introduction of the intact csrS gene into the severe invasive GAS restored the susceptibility to the killing by PMN ( p = 0. 015 compared with severe invasive isolates + CsrS) ( Figure 6A), abrogated the inhibition of PMN migration by degradation of IL - 8 ( p = 0. 002 compared with invasive isolates + CsrS) ( Figure 4A, 4B, and 6B), and diminished the killing activity for PMN by necrosis ( p = 0. 00016 compared with invasive isolates + CsrS) ( Figure 3A, 3C, and 6C), These results strongly suggest that mutations in the csrS gene correspond to the immunocompromized activity in the severe invasive isolates, associated with inhibition of PMN recruitment and survival.

Consistently, an introduction of the intact csrS gene into the NIH230 strain ( NIH230:: csrS +) reduced the LD50 value to the level observed in the non - invasive strain.

Histopathologically, in the mice injected with the NIH230 strain, bacteria formed clusters in interstitial tissues in the kidneys and the lungs, accompanied congestion and no inflammatory cells at infectious foci ( Figure 7B, 7C and data not shown).

Contrarily, no significant pathological alterations were observed in the mice injected with the 1566 and NIH230:: csrS + strains ( Figure 7B and 7C).

Figure 7D shows that subcutaneous infection of NIH230 formed the infected lesions with area significantly larger than those of 1566 and NIH230:: csrS +.

These results suggest that the invasive GAS isolates are more virulent in vivo than non - invasive GAS, and impair PMN function in vivo, owing, at least in part, to the mutations in the csrS gene.

These results suggest that enhanced expression of ScpC and SLO in invasive GAS plays an important role in vivo virulence of GAS infection.

It have been demonstrated that CsrS / R is a member of the two - component regulatory systems for regulating the multipe virulence factors of GAS, by using genetically - manipulated GAS mutants [ 20].

The present study demonstrate that the loss - of - functional mutations in csrS gene which were accumulated in clinically isolated GAS from patients with severe invasive infections, but not with emm - matched non - invasive strains.

Introduction of the intact csrS gene into the severe invasive GAS restored the susceptibility to the killing by PMN and abrogated the activity for inhibition of PMN recruitment and survival, thus, demonstrating an instructional role of the loss - of - functional mutations in csrS gene for the evasion of PMN functions, providing unique pathophysiology of invasive GAS infections.

Furthermore, SLS hemolytic activity of invasive GAS is significantly decreased as compared with non - invasive strains ( data not shown) and SLS - deletion in invasive GAS did not affect PMN survival at all, excluding the possibility for the role of SLS in PMN necrosis seen in this study.

The present study also uncovers that increased activity of SLO from invasive GAS isolates induces rapid and extensive necrosis to human PMN.

Consistently, the high mortality and histopathological findings which lacks PMN infiltration in mice tissues infected with csrS - mutated GAS ( Figure 7) are similar to those seen in clinical invasive GAS infections [ 32].

These evidences suggest that the level of PMN function is one of the critical factors to determine the threshold for the onset of invasive GAS infection, which may be the reason for rare outbreaks of invasive GAS infections.

Although USP family proteins are expressed by many bacterial pathogens [ 7], [ 8], to date, there has only been one in vivo study, which showed that a Salmonella USP promotes virulence in mice [ 17].

Guinea pigs are able to control the growth of Erdman bacilli following the onset of adaptive immunity at approximately3 weeks post - infection, as evident by the relatively stable pulmonary bacterial burden beyond the 3 week time point, yet levels of Deltarv2623 bacilli continued to increase at a reduced but steady rate resulting in a rapidly progressing infection.

In contrast to the result of the guinea pig study, we observed no difference in the kinetics of infection between C57BL / 6 mice infected with wildtype M. tuberculosis, Deltarv2623, or the attB:: Phsp60 Rv2623 complemented strain in a low dose aerogenic model [ 19], as assessed by lung bacterial burden ( Figure 4A).

However, the mouse is a relatively resistant host to M. tuberculosis, particularly in strains such as C57BL / 6 [ 20], [ 21].

Thus, the hypervirulence phenotype of Deltarv2623 observed in the susceptible guinea pig model could have been masked in the C57BL / 6 mice.	"guinea pig	78	88	Organism"	"C57BL / 6 mice	125	139	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""guinea pig"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""C57BL / 6 mice"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Indeed, the Deltarv2623 mutant was markedly more virulent relative to wildtype Erdman M. tuberculosis following aerogenic infection, as assessed by the mean survival time of C3H / HeJ mice infected with these strains ( 62 and 25. 5 days post infection for Erdman - and Deltarv2623 - infected mice, respectively, p = 0. 0014; Figure 4B).

Finally, survival of Deltarv2623 - infected mice was also significantly reduced in another susceptible mouse strain, C3HeB / FeJ ( Figure S1).

Therefore, the hypervirulence of Deltarv2623 in guinea pigs and susceptible mice is intriguing; if Rv2623 provides M. tuberculosis protection against stress, it might be expected that the Rv2623 - deficient mutant would be attenuated in vivo.

However, biofilm development has been considered to be distinct from other developmental processes including the programmed differentiation seen in spore formation in Bacillus subtilis or fruiting body formation in Myxococcus xanthus [ 11], mainly because no regulatory pathways have yet been identified that are responsible for regulating committed steps in the formation of biofilms with the exception of attachment.

Notably, several genes with known or predicted roles in protection against the mammalian innate immune system and in pathogenesis were upregulated in the flea, suggesting that transit through the insect vector preinduces a phenotype that enhances Y. pestis survival and dissemination in the mammal after flea - borne transmission.

Blockage occurred between 1. 5 and 3. 5 weeks after the initial infectious blood meal, during which time the fleas fed on uninfected mice twice weekly.

Because blockage of the flea vector is essentially a biofilm phenomenon, Y. pestis genes whose expression patterns are significantly upregulated in the flea and flowcell biofilms relative to planktonic cultures ( Table S4) might indicate that they are transmission factors.	"flea	24	28	Organism"	"flea	152	156	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 152, ""end_span"": 156, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The Y. pestis homologs of Pseudomonas aeruginosa cupA1 and cupA3 in a predicted fimbrial biosynthesis operon and yapL, a predicted autotransporter adhesin similar to E. coli tibA, were specifically upregulated in the flea ( Table S1).

Although genes in the polyamine transport gabTpotDBC locus are among the most highly induced genes in the flea ( Table S1) and polyamines are essential for Y. pestis biofilm formation [ 30], we have previously reported that a Y. pestis Deltapot mutant has no defect in flea infection or blockage [ 31].

With this study, the in vivo transcriptome of Y. pestis in blocked fleas and in the rat bubo [ 11] have now both been characterized.

In addition to the known temperature - induced virulence factors, iron acquisition systems, including the ybt and yfe operons that are required for virulence; and oxidative and nitrosative stress response genes, including the hmp virulence factor, are highly upregulated in the rat bubo, but not the flea.

Expression of genes in the pH 6 antigen locus ( psaEFABC), responsible for the synthesis and transport of the PsaA fimbriae that enhance resistance to phagocytosis by macrophages [ 35], [ 36], were higher in the bubo than the flea, although the usher protein gene psaC was upregulated in the flea compared to in vitro growth ( Tables 1, S1).

Despite the upregulation of phoP in the flea, with the notable exception of mgtC there was little correlation between predicted PhoP - regulated genes in vitro and genes upregulated in the flea [ 39], [ 46], [ 47].	"flea	40	44	Organism"	"flea	189	193	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 189, ""end_span"": 193, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We previously reported that the genes for these Tc - like proteins are highly expressed in fleas, but that their products are nontoxic to fleas [ 49].	"fleas	91	96	Organism"	"fleas	138	143	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""fleas"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""fleas"", ""start_span"": 138, ""end_span"": 143, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
yitR, a LysR - type regulator that activates the Tc - like yit genes [ 50], was upregulated > 10 - fold in the flea, but its expression was not detected in the rat bubo ( Table 1).	"flea	111	115	Organism"	"rat	160	163	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 115, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""rat"", ""start_span"": 160, ""end_span"": 163, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The specific induction in the flea of yitR and genes in the adjacent Tc - like yit and yip loci suggests that they are involved in adaptation to and colonization of the flea.	"flea	30	34	Organism"	"flea	169	173	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Because phoP is required by Y. pestis to produce a transmissible infection in fleas ( unpublished data), it was not possible to similarly assess the effect on disease transmission of phoP induction in the flea.	"fleas	78	83	Organism"	"flea	205	209	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""fleas"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 205, ""end_span"": 209, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Coming from the flea, Y. pestis is also associated with the biofilm ECM, identical or closely related to the poly - beta - 1, 6 - N - acetyl glucosamine ECM of staphylococcal biofilms, which has been shown to provide protection from innate immune components [ 55], [ 56].

In addition, although the antiphagocytic F1 capsule and Psa fimbriae do not appear to be produced in the flea, upregulation in the flea of most F1 genes in the cafRcaf1M1A1 locus and the Psa usher protein gene psaC ( Tables 1, S1) suggests that components of the F1 and Psa translocation system are made, which may prime Y. pestis for rapid secretion of these extracellular virulence factors after transmission.	"flea	105	109	Organism"	"flea	131	135	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 105, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 135, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Increased resistance to innate immunity that is preinduced in the flea vector may be critical to productive transmission because blocked fleas transmit relatively few bacteria, often below the LD50 of Y. pestis grown in vitro at < 28degreesC [ 1], [ 52].

IgG Endopeptidase SeMac does not Inhibit Opsonophagocytosis of Streptococcus equi Subspecies equi by Horse Polymorphonuclear Leukocytes	"Streptococcus equi Subspecies equi	63	97	Organism"	"Horse	101	106	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Streptococcus equi Subspecies equi"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Horse"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 106, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The horse pathogen Streptococcus equi subspecies equi produces a homologue of Mac ( SeMac).

Mice with experimental S. equi infection and horses with strangles caused by S. equi seroconverted to SeMac, indicating that SeMac is produced in vivo during infection.

For examples, both S. equi and group A Streptococcus ( GAS) produce the hyaluronic acid capsule and surface protein M protein to contribute to resistance to phagocytosis by PMNs.

The results indicate that SeMac is a cysteine endopeptidase but does not inhibit opsonophagocytosis of S. equi by horse PMNs, suggesting that SeMac has function other than evading horse acquired immunity against S. equi infection.

The protein shares 62. 4% identity in amino acid sequence with Mac made by serotype M1 GAS and a putative secretion signal sequence ( amino acids 1 - 34), and the catalytic residues of GAS Mac consisting of Cys94, His262 and Asp284 are conserved in SeMac ( Cys102, His272 and Asp 294) ( Fig. 1).

To test whether SeMac is produced in vivo during S. equi infection, the presence of SeMac - specific antibody was assessed by Western immunoblot analysis with convalescent sera from 3 horses suffered from strangles and mice with experimental S. equi infection.

Endopeptidase Activity of SeMac against Horse IgG1 and Human IgG	"Horse	40	45	Organism"	"Human	55	60	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Horse"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Human"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
GAS Mac can cleave the heavy chain of human IgG at the lower hinge region between Fab and Fc fragments.

Purified recombinant SeMac and GAS Mac were then tested for activity to cleave horse IgG.

To test this possibility, available horse IgG1 and a mixture of IgG1 and IgG4 were treated with SeMac or GAS Mac.

The bacteria were labeled with FITC, treated with S. equi - specific horse convalescent serum in the absence or presence of SeMac, and incubated with horse blood.	"horse	69	74	Organism"	"horse	150	155	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""horse"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""horse"", ""start_span"": 150, ""end_span"": 155, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The inability of SeMac to inhibit S. equi opsonophagocytosis by horse PMNs may be due to its inability to cleave the majority of horse IgG.

To test this idea, the phagocytosis assay was repeated using GAS and human blood.	"GAS	61	64	Organism"	"human	69	74	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""GAS"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
SeMac indeed inhibits the opsonophagocytosis of GAS by human PMNs ( Fig. 5B).	"GAS	48	51	Organism"	"human	55	60	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""GAS"", ""start_span"": 48, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In this study we describe that SeMac is a cysteine endopeptidase with limited activity against horse IgG and is unable to inhibit opsonophagocytosis of S. equi by horse PMNs in a whole blood assay.

If this is true, horse IgG3 may be also cleavable by SeMac, while the other five horse IgG subgroups may not be cleaved.

The fact that SeMac does not inhibit opsonophagocytosis of S. equi by horse PMNs indicates that SeMac is not involved in the evasion of the acquired horse immunity against S. equi.
