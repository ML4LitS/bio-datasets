OG1 and its derivatives have been successfully used over the past 20 years in various animal models, starting with the demonstration that it can cause caries in germ - free rats [ 7], and later to characterize factors important for E. faecalis virulence in a mouse model of peritonitis [ 13], a rabbit model of endophthalmitis [ 14], a rat model of endocarditis [ 15] and in a mouse urinary tract infection model [ 16].

Overall, we found 64 areas of divergence between the genomes that can be divided into 3 classes: an additional sequence present in OG1RF when compared with V583; a sequence replacement where a sequence in OG1RF differs from the sequence in V583; and the absence of a sequence from OG1RF when compared with V583.
