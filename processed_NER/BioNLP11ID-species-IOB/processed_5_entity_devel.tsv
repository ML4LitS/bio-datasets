To shed light on the mystery of high virulence of the epidemic outbreak strains of SS2, our joint research group completed a comprehensive study of comparative genomics, decoding the whole genome sequences of two virulent SS2 strains ( 98HAH12 and 05ZYH33) isolated from Chinese infected patients [ 6].

These mutants were TB2588s ( araC - like, PA2588, p < 0. 001), TB4380s ( colS - like, PA4380, p < 0. 001), TB3080s ( hypothetical, PA3080, p < 0. 01), TB2769s ( hypothetical, PA2769, p < 0. 05) and TB5479s ( gltP - like, PA5479, p < 0. 05).
