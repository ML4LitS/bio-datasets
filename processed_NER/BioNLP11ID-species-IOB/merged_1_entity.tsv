The yit and yip genes in a Y. pestis locus ( y0181 - 0191) that encode predicted insecticidal - like toxins of the toxin complex ( Tc) family and three linked phage - related genes were upregulated 4 - to 50 - fold in the flea midgut ( Tables 1 and S1).	flea,222,226,Organism	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 222, ""end_span"": 226, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	train

To determine if the insecticidal - like toxins were involved in resistance to phagocytosis, we repeated the macrophage experiments with a Y. pestis DeltayitR mutant, which as expected showed greatly reduced expression of the yit and yip genes in vitro and in the flea ( Fig. 4B).	flea,263,267,Organism	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 263, ""end_span"": 267, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	train

Mild acid pH induces transcription of PmrA - regulated genes To examine the mild acid pH induction of PmrA - activated genes, we grew Salmonella cells harbouring chromosomal lacZYA transcriptional fusions to the PmrA - regulated genes pbgP, pmrC and ugd ( Wosten and Groisman, 1999) in N - minimal media buffered at pH 5. 8 or 7. 7.

In support of this hypothesis, previous studies have demonstrated for both Serratia marcescens and P. fluorescens that Type I transporters can be polyvalent and secrete different types of proteins such as proteases and lipases [ 18, 19].

The observation that P. entomophila persistence in flies and larvae is lower in aprA mutants clearly indicates that the AprA protease promotes bacterial persistence in the Drosophila gut.

Our previous study had already revealed that the humoral arm of the Drosophila immune response mediated by the Imd pathway contributes to resistance against orally transmitted P. entomophila, since flies mutated in the Relish ( Rel) gene showed a consistently increased mortality rate [ 9].

P. entomophila, but not the gacA derivative, rapidly activates both the local and systemic Imd - dependent immune responses in Drosophila adults, which can be demonstrated using RT - qPCR with fat body and gut extracts ( Figure 5A).

The rationale behind this experiment is based on previous observations that an oral infection with Ecc15 triggers a local, but not a systemic immune response at the adult stage ( our unpublished data) [ 8].

Local Expression of AMP Genes Plays a Major Role against Food - Borne Infections The use of GFP reporter transgenes in Drosophila has revealed that, in addition to the fat body, AMP genes can be expressed in several barrier epithelia that are in direct contact with microorganisms from the environment [ 7, 23].

The Imd pathway regulates a large number of immune genes including those encoding AMPs; and two peptides, Diptericin and Attacin, are preferentially synthesized following bacterial infection in the digestive tract of Drosophila [ 7].

It is also possible that Diptericin could reach high concentration levels in restricted areas of the Drosophila gut such as the proventriculus and thus be more effective against pathogens than in other body compartments.

This conclusion is based on our observations that ( i) aprA mutants show attenuated virulence, ( ii) aprA mutants survive less well than wild - type P. entomophila in Drosophila and are more sensitive to Imd - mediated defense, and ( iii) AprA provides specific protection in vivo against Diptericin.

It is interesting to note that S. marcescens, another potent oral pathogen of Drosophila, also expresses a protease that can degrade AMPs in vitro [ 12].	Drosophila,78,88,Organism	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test

Alternatively, in Photorhabdus luminescens, an AprA homologue, PrtA, has been proposed not to be a virulence factor, but rather to be involved in degrading host tissues following host death in order to promote efficient nutrition and development of its symbiotic nematode host [ 14, 29].

LC - MS - based proteomics was used to obtain a general overview of the effects of Hfq and SmpB on global protein translation in Salmonella.	Salmonella,129,139,Organism	"[{""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
Across all experimental datasets we observed a total of 1621 Salmonella Typhimurium proteins ( Table S1), corresponding to approximately36% coverage of predicted protein coding regions.

Across each of the four growth conditions examined our analysis revealed that Hfq had a far more significant effect on the Salmonella Typhimurium proteome than SmpB.

This is in agreement with a recent study that found that Hfq affects 18% of the Salmonella genome [ 10].	Salmonella,80,90,Organism	"[{""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
Considering the reported pleitropic nature of deletion of hfq on the biology of Salmonella Typhimurium it is likely that a proportion of the changes in protein abundances maybe a non - specific and / or secondary consequence of hfq deletion.

However this most likely is an underestimate of the true number of proteins that are regulated by Hfq, if accurate protein identifications could be made for the remaining 2829 orfs of the entire Salmonella proteome ( 4450 orfs) that are either expressed at levels too low to be detected or not expressed under the four growth conditions employed in this study.

Overall Hfq has a much stronger global effect on Salmonella protein translation than SmpB which is in agreement with the large number of regulatory sRNAs that serve as guides for Hfq translational modulation as opposed to the single regulatory sRNA ( i. e. tmRNA) that requires SmpB for activity.

Using a murine subcutaneous chamber model to sample the bacteria prior to selection or expansion of mutants, we compared gene expression dynamics of wild type ( WT) and previously isolated animal - passaged ( AP) covS mutant bacteria both in vitro and in vivo, and we found extensive transcriptional alterations of pathoadaptive and metabolic gene sets associated with invasion, immune evasion, tissue - dissemination, and metabolic reprogramming.	murine,8,14,Organism	"[{""token"": ""murine"", ""start_span"": 8, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test

One of the most striking outcomes of these mutations is the constitutive repression of a gene encoding the key GAS cysteine protease, SpeB, which remodels the host - pathogen interface [ 29] by differentially degrading bacterial surface and secreted proteins [ 12], [ 30], [ 31] as well as host proteins [ 32], [ 33], [ 34].

Despite the association between covS mutations and the emergence of the hypervirulent phenotype of M1T1 strains, it is unclear whether this increased virulence can be entirely attributed to the modulation of the CovR regulon or if other networks are also perturbed in vivo directly, indirectly, or independently of the CovRS system.

Recently, putative two - component regulatory system genes encoding for sensor histidine kinase ( sak188) and DNA - binding response regulator ( sak189) were identified in S. agalactiae strains 98 - D60C and A909 [ 13], [ 14].
