However, as shown in Figure 5B, the csrS genes of all clinically isolated severe invasive GAS had a deletion, a point mutation, or an insertion, thereby, resulting in the creation of translational stop codons ( NIH147, NIH226, NIH230, and NIH269) or in a mutation in the presumed kinase domain ( NIH200).

During systemic mouse infection, Salmonella processes multiple environmental cues via more than 14 regulators We performed virulence assays on 83 regulators previously identified as required for Salmonella enteriditis virulence by one or more negative selection experiments in various hosts including calves, chickens, and mice [ 13], [ 21] - [ 23].
