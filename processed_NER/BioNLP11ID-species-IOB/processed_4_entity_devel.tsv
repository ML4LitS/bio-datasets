Background Streptococcus suis serotype 2 ( S. suis 2, SS2) has evolved into a highly infectious entity, which caused the two recent large - scale outbreaks of human SS2 epidemic in China, and is characterized by a toxic shock - like syndrome.

Furthermore, the mutants TB0260s ( hypothetical, PA0260) and TB5479s ( gltP - like) had a significant reduction in swimming motility ( Table 1) whereas the mutants TB2588s ( araC - like) and TB3080s ( hypothetical) had a significant reduction in swarming motility ( Table 1).

To ensure that the cheB2 gene in the TB strain is located in a cluster similar to the che2 cluster described for the PAO1 or PA14 strains, we further analyzed the corresponding TB chromosomal region.

The cheB2 mutant ( TB0173s) showed a significantly attenuated virulence during respiratory tract infection of mice as compared to the parental strain TB and the complemented strain TB0173sp2B2.
