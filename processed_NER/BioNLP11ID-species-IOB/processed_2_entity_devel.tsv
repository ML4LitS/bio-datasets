The acid tolerance response of Salmonella results in the synthesis of over 50 acid shock proteins ( Bearson et al., 1998) that are likely to function primarily when variations in internal pH occur, i. e. when Salmonella experiences severe acidic conditions ( pH approximately3) ( Foster, 2004).

The PmrA protein and its cognate sensor kinase PmrB form a two - component regulatory system that is required for virulence in mice ( Gunn et al., 2000), infection of chicken macrophages ( Zhao et al., 2002), growth in soil ( Chamnongpol et al., 2002), resistance to the cationic peptide antibiotic polymyxin B ( Roland et al., 1993) and resistance to Fe3 + - ( Wosten et al., 2000) and Al3 + - mediated killing ( Nishino et al., 2006).

This may be particularly important for Salmonella living in soil due to the fact that the antimicrobial peptide polymyxin B is produced by the soil bacterium Paenibacillus polymyxa ( Paulus and Gray, 1964) and because the solubility of metals such as Fe3 + increases in acid pH.

Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is a facultative intracellular pathogen that initiates disease, which is normally limited to gastroenteritis in humans.

We examined the ability of an mlc mutant, SR1304, to invade cultured HEp - 2 and HeLa epithelial cells.

Figure 1C shows that SL1344 killed 42% of the macrophages, whereas SR1304 killed only 16% of the macrophages 4h after infection, which demonstrates that the mlc gene plays an important role in the expression of genes involved in cytotoxicity.

When the number of intracellular bacteria were measured at 2 and 18h post - infection, the degree of replication was similar for SL1344 and SR1304 ( Figure 1D).

Collectively, these results suggest that the main target of Mlc action in Salmonella virulence is SPI1, which is known to encode various genes that are required for Salmonella invasion of host cells.

To identify the target gene in SPI1 that is regulated by Mlc, the expression patterns of the SPI1 - regulatory genes, which include hilA, invF, hilC and hilD, were examined by primer extension analysis of total RNA from SL1344 and SR1304 grown statically to the exponential phase.

SR1304 exhibited a > 10 - fold reduction in hilA and HilA - dependent invF ( invFA) expression, and about a 3 - fold reduction in hilD and HilC / D - dependent invF ( invFD) expression, compared to SL1344.

When these cells were grown in static cultures to exponential phase, SL1344 - pMAB69 expressed 28. 9 + / - 3. 5 Miller units of beta - galactosidase, whereas SR1304 - pMAB69 expressed 49. 5 + / - 5. 3 Miller units of beta - galactosidase; the level of hilE expression in the mlc mutant was almost 1. 8 - fold higher than that in the wild - type strain.

SL1344 and SR1304 carrying either pMAB69 ( hilE - lacZY) or pJB5 ( hilD - lacZY) were cultivated in TB that was buffered to pH 7. 0 with 0. 1M MOPS, to minimize pH effects arising from growth in the presence of the various carbon sources.

To test the role of SalK / SalR in the pathogenesis of SS2, we constructed a homologous suicide plasmid, pUC:: salKR with a SpcR cassette ( Fig. 3A), and electrotransformed the competent cells of 05ZYH33.

In contrast, six infected piglets with an avirulent strain, 05HAS68 ( as negative control), survived nearly without any obvious symptoms until the end of the experiment ( 14 days after infection).

As shown in Table 1, wild - type bacteria were found in all of the SS2 specific tissues of WT - infected piglets, including heart, lung, liver, kidney, spleen, tonsil, brain, blood, joints and so on.

Obviously, lack of SalK / SalR badly impaired the capability of 05ZYH33 to colonize the various tissues of piglets.

In order to define the role of SalK / SalR in SS2 infection, an isogenic SalK / SalR - deficient mutant was generated and the impact of salKR deletion on virulence of SS2 was assessed.

High Throughput Assay for Nematode Killing by P. aeruginosa It was reported earlier that relatively high - throughput screening procedures performed on plates could be used to identify virulence factors in various pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus [ 32], P. aeruginosa [ 8] or Serratia marcescens [ 33].

The TB0173s ( cheB2) ( Figure 2 and Table 1) and TB4953s ( motB) ( Table 1) mutants showed a reduction in swimming and swarming motility, respectively.
