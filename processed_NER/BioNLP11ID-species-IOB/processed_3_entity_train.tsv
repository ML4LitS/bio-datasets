In a first attempt to determine the virulence of the complemented H37Ra knock - in strains relative to wild - type H37Ra and H37Rv, bone marrow - derived murine macrophages ( BMM) were infected with the different strains at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI) of 1: 1 and 10: 1 bacteria per cell.

However, in comparison to the corresponding MT103 wild - type strain, the SO2 strain showed a strongly reduced ESAT - 6 and CFP - 10 specific T cell response, corresponding to a similar low level as the H37Ra strain ( Figure 3B).

Thus, in order to determine the reason for the observed failure of H37Ra to induce ESAT - 6 - specific responses, H37Rv and H37Ra strains were tested for their potential to express and secrete ESAT - 6 in vitro.

As closer inspection of the available literature on transcriptional analyses of a H37Rv - phoP ko strain [ 21] and H37Ra [ 12] suggested that the expression of gene cluster rv3612c - rv3616c is reduced in both strains, we evaluated the expression level of rv3614c in H37Rv, H37Ra, and H37Ra:: phoP by quantitative real time PCR ( qRT - PCR).

Steenken et al. have shown that the virulence of the H37 strain was associated with colony morphology and that the avirulent variant H37Ra failed to propagate in an ordinarily susceptible host while the virulent variant H37Rv was able to proliferate [ 6].

However, as previously observed in complementation studies of BCG [ 18], the level of virulence displayed by the phoP complemented H37Ra strain was still substantially below that of wild - type H37Rv, arguing that the strong attenuation of the H37Ra strain is likely based on several different genetic lesions, such as the one responsible for the absence of phthiocerol dimycocerosates ( PDIM) [ 29], that were probably introduced into this strain during years of continued culture following the original event of attenuation described by Steenken et al. in 1934 [ 6].

Finally, it is intriguing that both BCG and H37Ra, the two most often used attenuated tubercle bacilli, are attenuated for reasons linked to loss of ESAT - 6 functions.

The graRS mutant is more susceptible to killing by LL - 37 and human neutrophil granulocytes in vitro In an attempt to test whether the increased affinity of the graRS mutant to cationic molecules leads to higher susceptibility to human host defense peptides, we compared inactivation of WT and graRS mutant by the human cathelicidin LL - 37.

Group A streptococcus isolates from severe invasive infections is resistant to killing by human PMN To examine whether emm49 GAS isolated from severe invasive infection might alter human PMN function, we performed phagocytosis assay in vitro.

As shown in Figure 3B, incubation of PMN with supernatant from co - culture of IL - 8 and invasive or non - invasive GAS did not affect PMN viability, suggesting that severe invasive GAS causes PMN killing following encounter with bacteria in a contact - dependent manner.

The results showed that NIH230scpC neither digested IL - 8, like 1566 strain, ( Figure 4B) nor abrogated the migration of PMN in response to IL - 8, comparable to 1566 strain ( Figure 4A), whereas the mutant killed the migrated PMN as well as the parent strain NIH230 ( data not shown).

The non - invasive 1566 strain displayed the LD50 value approximately 100 - fold higher than that of the severe invasive NIH230 strain ( Table 1), whereas a csrS deletion ( 1566DeltacsrS) caused an increase in the LD50 value comparable to that of the NIH230 strain.

SLO and ScpC independently enable GAS to escape from PMN functions; Present data using clinical isolated GAS and a scpC - deletion mutant ( Figure 4A and 4B) show that enhanced production of serine proteinase ScpC in virulent GAS is essential to impair PMN migration in vitro by degradation of IL - 8, as others partially have demonstrated [ 17] - [ 19].

In the present study, we observed that SLO concentration in a short - time culture with severe invasive GAS did not reach the threshold level to kill PMN by formation of pores ( data not shown) and that PMN did not undergo necrosis upon incubation with culture media of severe invasive GAS ( Figure 3B), leading to the novel possibility that PMN are probably killed following encounter with invasive GAS in a contact - dependent manner.

Transcriptional profile of Y. pestis in the flea Little is known about the environmental conditions in the flea digestive tract, how Y. pestis adapts to them, or the physiological state of the bacteria at transmission when they exit the flea and enter the mammal.	"flea	44	48	Organism"	"flea	107	111	Organism"	"flea	237	241	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 237, ""end_span"": 241, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The ymt gene was among the most highly expressed genes in the flea ( Table S3), but neither it nor the known transmission factors ( hmsHFRS, hmsT, hmsP, and gmhA) showed significantly higher expression in the flea than in vitro at 21degreesC, indicating that they are induced primarily by low temperature, and not by environmental factors specific to the flea gut.

About 15% of Y. pestis genes showed significantly higher relative expression levels or expression only in the flea than in the bubo; 24% were more highly expressed in the bubo than in the flea; and 61% were not differentially expressed in the two hosts ( Fig. 3).

To assess the overall effect of the flea - specific phenotype on this encounter, we compared the interaction of Y. pestis recovered from infected fleas and from in vitro cultures with murine bone marrow macrophages.

The secreted Mac protein made by group A Streptococcus ( GAS) inhibits opsonophagocytosis of GAS by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( PMNs).

SeMac does not inhibit opsonophagocytosis of S. equi by horse PMNs but opsonophagocytosis of GAS by human PMNs.

Gram - positive bacterium Streptococcus equi subspeices equi ( S. equi) causes equine strangles, a highly contagious purulent lymphadenitis and one of the most common infectious diseases in horses [ 1, 2].

We found that GAS produces a secreted Mac protein ( also known as IdeE), which inhibits opsonophagocytosis of GAS by human PMNs [ 5].	"GAS	14	17	Organism"	"GAS	110	113	Organism"	"human	117	122	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""GAS"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""GAS"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
If this is true, SeMac should inhibit opsonophagocytosis of GAS by human PMNs, since SeMac efficiently cleaves human IgG.	"GAS	60	63	Organism"	"human	67	72	Organism"	"human	111	116	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""GAS"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Although both SeMac and GAS Mac efficiently cleave human IgG, they cannot cleave the majority of total horse IgG.	"GAS	24	27	Organism"	"human	51	56	Organism"	"horse	103	108	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""GAS"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 51, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""horse"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Cleavable horse IgG1 has PELLGG, while the non - cleavable horse IgG4 has PECLSVG in the same region, suggesting that the amino acid sequences of the lower hinge region are important for cleavability by SeMac and GAS Mac.	"horse	10	15	Organism"	"horse	59	64	Organism"	"GAS	213	216	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""horse"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""horse"", ""start_span"": 59, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""GAS"", ""start_span"": 213, ""end_span"": 216, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Thus, there is a correlation between the enzymatic activity of SeMac and its ability to inhibit opsonophagocytosis, suggesting that SeMac functions like GAS M1 Mac in the inhibition of opsonophagocytosis of GAS by human PMNs.
