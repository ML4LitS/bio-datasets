In recent years, Drosophila has emerged as a powerful model for the study of host - pathogen interactions [ 1, 2].	"Drosophila	17	27	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 17, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
An attractive feature of the Drosophila system is the existence of multiple defense reactions that are shared with higher organisms [ 3 - 5].	"Drosophila	29	39	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Our knowledge of the Drosophila immune response is mainly based on the analysis of host reactions following direct injection of non - pathogenic bacteria into the insect hemocoel.	"Drosophila	21	31	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 31, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Recently we have developed the use of natural oral infection to dissect host responses of Drosophila after challenge with bacteria demonstrated to be infectious for this insect.	"Drosophila	90	100	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We demonstrated that P. entomophila induces both systemic and local immune responses in Drosophila and causes a food - uptake cessation following oral infection in larvae.	"Drosophila	88	98	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 98, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Transposon mutagenesis of P. entomophila allowed us to identify several regulatory genes required to infect or to kill Drosophila.	"Drosophila	119	129	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Among them we identified the GacS / GacA two - component regulatory system which, in Pseudomonas fluorescens, has been well characterized and demonstrated to be an essential regulator of virulence [ 11].	"Pseudomonas fluorescens	85	108	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Pseudomonas fluorescens"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Here we report an in vivo analysis of P. entomophila virulence to both Drosophila larvae and adult flies following natural oral infection.	"Drosophila	71	81	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Drosophila Imd - regulated local gut response is necessary to combat infection and that P. entomophila AprA - regulation via GacS / GacA and PrtR regulators is used as a strategy to escape AMP activity.	"Drosophila	37	47	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
To test whether P. entomophila could secrete such toxic factors, a supernatant filtrate from a bacterial culture was tested for its ability to kill Drosophila.	"Drosophila	148	158	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Figure 1A shows that a concentrated P. entomophila culture filtrate had a moderate but significant effect on Drosophila larvae survival following ingestion.	"Drosophila	109	119	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
To analyze the in vivo contribution of AprA to P. entomophila virulence, we performed a survival analysis of Drosophila larvae and adults after oral infection with various P. entomophila derivatives.	"Drosophila	109	119	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Using the same assay, both prtR and gacA mutants were almost avirulent toward Drosophila indicating that both genes regulate other virulence factors in addition to AprA ( Figure 2B).	"Drosophila	78	88	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In support of this hypothesis, previous studies have demonstrated for both Serratia marcescens and P. fluorescens that Type I transporters can be polyvalent and secrete different types of proteins such as proteases and lipases [ 18, 19].	"Serratia marcescens	75	94	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Serratia marcescens"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The observation that P. entomophila persistence in flies and larvae is lower in aprA mutants clearly indicates that the AprA protease promotes bacterial persistence in the Drosophila gut.	"Drosophila	172	182	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 172, ""end_span"": 182, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Our previous study had already revealed that the humoral arm of the Drosophila immune response mediated by the Imd pathway contributes to resistance against orally transmitted P. entomophila, since flies mutated in the Relish ( Rel) gene showed a consistently increased mortality rate [ 9].	"Drosophila	68	78	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
P. entomophila, but not the gacA derivative, rapidly activates both the local and systemic Imd - dependent immune responses in Drosophila adults, which can be demonstrated using RT - qPCR with fat body and gut extracts ( Figure 5A).	"Drosophila	127	137	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 137, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The rationale behind this experiment is based on previous observations that an oral infection with Ecc15 triggers a local, but not a systemic immune response at the adult stage ( our unpublished data) [ 8].	"Ecc15	99	104	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Ecc15"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
To ascertain that the protection was due to Imd pathway activation and not to a competition between P. entomophila and Ecc15, we next monitored resistance to P. entomophila of wild - type and Rel flies orally infected by Ecc15 evf -.	"Ecc15	119	124	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Ecc15"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 124, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Altogether, our results provide an in vivo demonstration that AprA functions in the protection of P. entomophila against Drosophila AMPs.	"Drosophila	121	131	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
To study how flies deal with infections in a natural context, we investigated the interactions between Drosophila and a newly identified entomopathogen, P. entomophila.	"Drosophila	103	113	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Local Expression of AMP Genes Plays a Major Role against Food - Borne Infections The use of GFP reporter transgenes in Drosophila has revealed that, in addition to the fat body, AMP genes can be expressed in several barrier epithelia that are in direct contact with microorganisms from the environment [ 7, 23].	"Drosophila	119	129	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 119, ""end_span"": 129, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The precise relevance of this local immune response in Drosophila has not been established to date.	"Drosophila	55	65	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 55, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The Imd pathway regulates a large number of immune genes including those encoding AMPs; and two peptides, Diptericin and Attacin, are preferentially synthesized following bacterial infection in the digestive tract of Drosophila [ 7].	"Drosophila	217	227	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 217, ""end_span"": 227, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
It is also possible that Diptericin could reach high concentration levels in restricted areas of the Drosophila gut such as the proventriculus and thus be more effective against pathogens than in other body compartments.	"Drosophila	101	111	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Our study suggests that Diptericin expression in the anterior gut provides an efficient early barrier allowing Drosophila to rapidly eliminate most ingested bacteria.	"Drosophila	111	121	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 121, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This can be compared with many human pathogens for which activation of an inflammatory response represents a part of their invasive strategy [ 25].	"human	31	36	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 31, ""end_span"": 36, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This conclusion is based on our observations that ( i) aprA mutants show attenuated virulence, ( ii) aprA mutants survive less well than wild - type P. entomophila in Drosophila and are more sensitive to Imd - mediated defense, and ( iii) AprA provides specific protection in vivo against Diptericin.	"Drosophila	167	177	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 167, ""end_span"": 177, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
It is interesting to note that S. marcescens, another potent oral pathogen of Drosophila, also expresses a protease that can degrade AMPs in vitro [ 12].	"Drosophila	78	88	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, in the absence of a Serratia protease mutant, the in vivo relevance of the protease is not yet established.	"Serratia protease mutant	29	53	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Serratia protease mutant"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 53, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Taken together, this observation and our findings suggest that proteases may represent a common strategy used by Drosophila pathogens to circumvent the potent antimicrobial host defense.	"Drosophila	113	123	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Alternatively, in Photorhabdus luminescens, an AprA homologue, PrtA, has been proposed not to be a virulence factor, but rather to be involved in degrading host tissues following host death in order to promote efficient nutrition and development of its symbiotic nematode host [ 14, 29].	"Photorhabdus luminescens	18	42	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Photorhabdus luminescens"", ""start_span"": 18, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This indicates that AprA is not the sole virulence factor required for persistence in the Drosophila gastrointestinal tract.	"Drosophila	90	100	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 90, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Food - uptake cessation or blockage in insects is induced by several other entomopathogenic bacteria including S. entomophila and Yersinia pestis, enabling persistence in the digestive tract of their insect hosts [ 35, 36].	"Yersinia pestis	130	145	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Yersinia pestis"", ""start_span"": 130, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In S. entomophila, it has been shown that genes encoded by a prophage were responsible for the anti - feeding reaction in its natural insect host, the grass grub Costelytra zealandica larvae [ 35].	"Costelytra zealandica	162	183	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Costelytra zealandica"", ""start_span"": 162, ""end_span"": 183, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Application of this method to Escherichia coli motility identifies 95% of the known flagellar and chemotaxis genes, and reveals three dozen novel loci that, to varying degrees and through diverse mechanisms, affect motility.	"Escherichia coli	30	46	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Escherichia coli"", ""start_span"": 30, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The best - characterized chemotaxis machineries are those of E. coli and its close relative Salmonella enterica [ 5, 6].	"Salmonella enterica	92	111	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Salmonella enterica"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We also selected for resistance to bacteriophage chi, which is known to infect and lyse cells only when they are motile.	"chi	49	52	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""chi"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
As a complementary approach to determining the components necessary for a functioning flagellum, we designed a simple selection to identify mutants resistant to chi - phage infection.	"chi	161	164	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""chi"", ""start_span"": 161, ""end_span"": 164, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Bacteriophage chi infects E. coli by attaching to and traveling along flagellar filaments [ 24].	"chi	14	17	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""chi"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
CCW flagellar rotation and the correct pattern of grooves on the surface of the flagellum are thought to drive chi - phage down the filament to the surface of the membrane, very similar to how a nut follows the grooves of a rotating bolt [ 25].	"chi	111	114	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""chi"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The library of transposon insertional mutants was exposed to chi - phage in an environment conducive to motility ( Figure 2A).	"chi	61	64	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""chi"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Figure 2B shows the distribution of z - scores after library selection upon exposure to bacteriophage chi, and the complete microarray results for duplicate selections can be found in Datasets S5 and S6.	"chi	102	105	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""chi"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
As expected, insertional mutations in flagellar genes conferred resistance to chi - phage infection.	"chi	78	81	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""chi"", ""start_span"": 78, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In contrast, while mutants of the chemotaxis sensory network were in high abundance after the chemotaxis selection, insertional mutants of cheA, cheB, cheR, cheW, tap, tar, trg, and tsr were in low abundance after exposure to chi - phage.	"chi	226	229	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""chi"", ""start_span"": 226, ""end_span"": 229, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The only exception among the che genes is cheZ, whose z - score of + 8. 7 indicates a CW flagellar rotation bias and reduced susceptibility to chi - phage infection.	"chi	143	146	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""chi"", ""start_span"": 143, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
"Therefore, in the absence of CheZ, CheY is maintained in the phosphorylated state, "" locking "" flagellar rotation in the CW direction, and hence minimizing infection by chi - phage."	"chi	169	172	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""chi"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 172, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The role these structures play in chi - phage infection and the impact they have on motility are discussed in a separate section below.	"chi	34	37	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""chi"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Application of microarray - based genetic footprinting to swimming, swarming, and chi - phage selection was effective in identifying nearly all known flagellar and chemotaxis genes.	"chi	82	85	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""chi"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Genes involved with the synthesis of LPS and OPG precursors ( hldD, hldE, galU, gmhA, gmhB, and pgm) were also highly abundant after chi - phage selection.	"chi	133	136	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""chi"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The widespread influence of LPS and OPG mutations on swimming, swarming, and chi - phage infection prompted us to explore the genetic mechanism of these mutations in more detail.	"chi	77	80	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""chi"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
A model summarizing the involvement of Rcs signaling on swimming, swarming, and chi - phage infection is shown in Figure 3G.	"chi	80	83	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""chi"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Surprisingly, this gene showed a negative z - score of - 8 after bacteriophage chi selection, indicating that this mutant is impaired in swimming motility but may show increased susceptibility to chi - phage infection relative to the wild - type strain.	"chi	79	82	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""chi"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 82, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
First, chi - phage infectivity assays with DeltayhjH mutants showed comparable levels of infection to cheR mutants ( which exhibit CCW flagellar rotation bias) in contrast to the reduced sensitivity displayed by cheZ mutants ( which have CW flagellar rotation bias), consistent with the z - scores of our chi - phage selection ( Figure 5E).	"chi	7	10	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""chi"", ""start_span"": 7, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

The occurrence of multiple antibiotic resistance determinants in V583 [ 6] makes it difficult to manipulate genetically.	"V583	65	69	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""V583"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 69, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
To avoid these issues, most laboratories use strain OG1 or its close derivatives.	"OG1	52	55	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""OG1"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 55, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
[ 10] estimated the size of the OG1RF genome as 2, 825 kb and created a restriction map of the chromosome.	"OG1RF	32	37	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""OG1RF"", ""start_span"": 32, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In addition to its virulence, the main reasons for the extensive use of OG1RF as a laboratory strain are that it does not carry plasmids, is readily transformable by electroporation, and is not resistant to commonly used antibiotics, other than rifampicin and fusidic acid.	"OG1RF	72	77	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""OG1RF"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These resistances were serially selected in OG1 to provide strain markers [ 9].	"OG1	44	47	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""OG1"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Numerous factors important for virulence have been characterized in OG1RF.	"OG1RF	68	73	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""OG1RF"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Ace mediates conditional ( that is, after growth at 46degreesC or in the presence of serum or collagen) adherence of E. faecalis to collagen type IV and to laminin [ 21] and, in unpublished data, influences the ability of OG1RF to cause experimental endocarditis ( KV Singh and BE Murray, unpublished observation).	"OG1RF	222	227	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""OG1RF"", ""start_span"": 222, ""end_span"": 227, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Finally, the Fsr system, a major positive and negative transcriptional regulator in OG1RF [ 22], affects expression of several virulence factor genes, including gelE, which encodes gelatinase [ 23], and contributes to infection in various animal models [ 15, 24].	"OG1RF	84	89	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""OG1RF"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The distinct MLST profile and the wide range of phenotypic and genotypic analyses of OG1RF, including many molecular genetic studies and experiments in various animal models, suggested that genomic analysis of this strain would prove insightful and would be useful to future studies.

This revealed approximately 232 kb encoding 227 open reading frames ( ORFs) that are unique to this important strain compared to V583.	"V583	129	133	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""V583"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
General genome features The complete circular chromosome of OG1RF was found to be 2, 739, 625 bp with an average G + C content of 37. 8%.	"OG1RF	60	65	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""OG1RF"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The complete OG1RF sequence was obtained using three independent techniques ( Solexa, the 454, and Sanger sequencing technique) with a higher than classic coverage ( more than 100 times), diminishing the likelihood of sequencing - related frameshifts, base errors and / or misassembly.	"OG1RF	13	18	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""OG1RF"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We found 232 kb of OG1RF unique sequences distributed in 48 regions ranging from 101 bp to approximately 49 kb in length ( Figure 1; Additional data file 1).	"OG1RF	19	24	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""OG1RF"", ""start_span"": 19, ""end_span"": 24, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Surprisingly, the genomes align syntenically, as shown in Figure 2, despite the fact that 25% of the V583 genome is composed of mobile elements.	"V583	101	105	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""V583"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 105, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Similarly, the presence of OG1RF - unique sequences has not affected the overall chromosomal arrangement.	"OG1RF	27	32	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""OG1RF"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Both OG1RF CRISPR elements are composed of 7 repeats of a 37 bp palindromic sequence with a 29 bp spacer.	"OG1RF	5	10	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""OG1RF"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
A unique feature of the OG1RF CRISPR1 locus is the presence of a gene downstream of the element, which encodes a hypothetical 119 amino acid transmembrane protein.	"OG1RF	24	29	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""OG1RF"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This indicates that the location of the CRISPR1 locus appears to be conserved ( between EF0672 and EF0673 when compared with the V583 genome).	"V583	129	133	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""V583"", ""start_span"": 129, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
It is appealing to postulate that the presence of the CRISPR locus in OG1RF may be the reason for the absence of prophage in this strain.	"OG1RF	70	75	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""OG1RF"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
[ 29] described a conserved 23. 9 kb chromosomal deletion when comparing fsrA - lacking / fsrC + / gelE + strains ( by PCR) from various origins with V583; the deleted sequences start in the middle of EF1841, include the fsrAB genes and end in the middle of the fsrC gene ( EF1820).

However, OG1RF _ 0186 carries fewer repeats than EF2505 while Ace and OG1RF _ 0165 carry more repeats than their counterparts in V583, suggesting that our observation does not fit this hypothesis or that the peptidoglycan depth is not uniform.

OG1RF does not contain homologues of EF2248 - 54 ( carrying instead the iol operon), though it has a novel WxL locus within the 14. 8 kb unique region upstream of the fsr locus ( Additional data file 2).

Finally, as previously found using PCR, the cpsCDEFGHIJK operon capsule polysaccharide genes [ 37] were confirmed here as missing, although OG1RF carries the cpsA and cpsB genes, which were proposed to be essential for E. faecalis since all strains tested by Hufnagel et al.

Consequently, it seems unlikely that this operon is a remnant of a vancomycin resistance operon in OG1RF, but rather part of a still unknown regulatory pathway.	"OG1RF	99	104	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""OG1RF"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

Also, the OG1RF operon carries two copies of an iolG - like gene, which encodes inositol 2 - dehydrogenase, the first enzyme of the myo - inositol degradation pathway ( Figure 5).	"OG1RF	10	15	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""OG1RF"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In addition, iolH, iolJ and iolK, present in L. casei, are not present in OG1RF, nor are iolH and iolK present in the C. perfringens iol operon.	"OG1RF	74	79	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""OG1RF"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

In addition, PCR verified the presence of iolE and iolR in these strains and in one negative for myo - inositol fermentation, indicating that the iol operon is not unique to OG1RF.	"OG1RF	174	179	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""OG1RF"", ""start_span"": 174, ""end_span"": 179, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

To assess the functionality of this operon in OG1RF, we evaluated the competence of cells in different phases of growth ( early log growth to stationary phase) using pAM401 [ 48] and pMSP3535VA [ 49].

In Streptococcus pneumoniae [ 50], the competence operon is tightly regulated by a quorum sensing two - component system ( ComDE) and a competence - stimulating peptide ( CSP; encoded by comC).

All but 45 of the missing genes are associated with putative mobile elements, such as the entire PAI, the recently described phages 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 [ 31], and the approximately 111 kb area between genes EF2240 and EF2351 ( including the vanB transposon) present in V583.

The absence of these elements appears also to be a characteristic of the commensal strain Symbioflor 1, although because the genome was not completely finished, the possibility remains that some of these regions were not sequenced.

In conclusion, other than the approximately 49 kb fragment containing a Tn916 homologue, it appears that OG1RF has only one additional possible mobile element derivative, namely the phage 2 proposed to be part of the core genome [ 31].

It may be that these clonal complexes are not more virulent per se, as defined in the assays described here, but rather are better able to survive and / or colonize hospitalized patients, taking advantage of factors that predispose to nosocomial infections such as urinary or venous catheters, or mucositis, among others.

In this study we utilize a SpeB - negative M1T1 clinical isolate, 5628, with a naturally occurring mutation in the gene encoding the regulator RopB, to elucidate the role of RopB and SpeB in systemic virulence.

However, SpeB has also been shown to cleave a range of GAS proteins such as the fibrinogen - binding M1 protein [ 14], [ 15], various superantigens [ 16], [ 17], the secreted plasminogen activator streptokinase [ 18] as well as the DNase Sda1 [ 17], and thus possibly interfere with the proven virulence functions of these bacterial factors.

Strain 5628RDeltaSpeB containing a full - length RopB but lacking SpeB also showed reduced virulence, suggesting that the reduced virulence of 5628 may primarily result from the lack of SpeB expression in this strain.

It is the loss of SpeB expression in these mutant bacteria that is hypothesized to allow the invasive spread of GAS by sparing from SpeB degradation self - proteins involved in plasminogen accumulation and activation [ 42].

This leads to the conclusion that ropB mutation in 5628 does not represent a similar mechanism to covR / S mutation and may ( a) be an incidental occurrence or ( b) arise secondary to different selection pressures than those associated with the shift to invasive infection.

Across all experimental datasets we observed a total of 1621 Salmonella Typhimurium proteins ( Table S1), corresponding to approximately36% coverage of predicted protein coding regions.

Across each of the four growth conditions examined our analysis revealed that Hfq had a far more significant effect on the Salmonella Typhimurium proteome than SmpB.

Considering the reported pleitropic nature of deletion of hfq on the biology of Salmonella Typhimurium it is likely that a proportion of the changes in protein abundances maybe a non - specific and / or secondary consequence of hfq deletion.

However this most likely is an underestimate of the true number of proteins that are regulated by Hfq, if accurate protein identifications could be made for the remaining 2829 orfs of the entire Salmonella proteome ( 4450 orfs) that are either expressed at levels too low to be detected or not expressed under the four growth conditions employed in this study.

Overall Hfq has a much stronger global effect on Salmonella protein translation than SmpB which is in agreement with the large number of regulatory sRNAs that serve as guides for Hfq translational modulation as opposed to the single regulatory sRNA ( i. e. tmRNA) that requires SmpB for activity.

Salmonella may have retained or evolved SsrB input here to create a positive feedback loop on the regulatory system to rapidly adapt to the host environment during infection, similar to transcriptional surge described for the PhoP response regulator [ 40].

The endosymbiotic relationship of Sodalis with the tsetse fly - where long - term vertical transmission has ostensibly been formative in shaping regulatory circuitry at certain promoters - may obviate the need for rapid transcriptional surge, leading to regulatory drift or selection against positive feedback.

Using a murine subcutaneous chamber model to sample the bacteria prior to selection or expansion of mutants, we compared gene expression dynamics of wild type ( WT) and previously isolated animal - passaged ( AP) covS mutant bacteria both in vitro and in vivo, and we found extensive transcriptional alterations of pathoadaptive and metabolic gene sets associated with invasion, immune evasion, tissue - dissemination, and metabolic reprogramming.

In contrast to the virulence - associated differences between WT and AP bacteria, Phenotype Microarray analysis showed minor in vitro phenotypic differences between the two isogenic variants.	"AP	69	71	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 69, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Additionally, our results reflect that WT bacteria ' s rapid host - adaptive transcriptional reprogramming was not sufficient for their survival, and they were outnumbered by hypervirulent covS mutants with SpeB - / Sdahigh phenotype, which survived up to 14 days in mice chambers.

We previously reported that virulent representatives of M1T1 GAS, with the phenotype SpeBhi / SpeA - / Sda1low, irreversibly switch to the hypervirulent SpeB - / SpeA + / Sda1high phenotype after > / = 3 days in vivo [ 12], [ 16] and that the parent phenotype vanishes by day 7 post - infection [ 16].	"M1T1 GAS	56	64	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""M1T1 GAS"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 64, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
One of the most striking outcomes of these mutations is the constitutive repression of a gene encoding the key GAS cysteine protease, SpeB, which remodels the host - pathogen interface [ 29] by differentially degrading bacterial surface and secreted proteins [ 12], [ 30], [ 31] as well as host proteins [ 32], [ 33], [ 34].	"GAS	111	114	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""GAS"", ""start_span"": 111, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
One of these preserved factors is the highly potent DNase, Sda1, which destroys neutrophil extracellular traps, NETs [ 36], protecting the bacteria from neutrophil killing, promoting bacterial invasion, and facilitating human plasminogen - mediated bacterial dissemination into normally sterile sites, which results in invasive infections [ 14].	"human	220	225	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 220, ""end_span"": 225, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Despite the association between covS mutations and the emergence of the hypervirulent phenotype of M1T1 strains, it is unclear whether this increased virulence can be entirely attributed to the modulation of the CovR regulon or if other networks are also perturbed in vivo directly, indirectly, or independently of the CovRS system.	"M1T1	99	103	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""M1T1"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Additionally, the effects of covS mutations on bacterial niche adaptability are still undetermined because the in vivo transcriptomes of the wild type ( WT) and animal - passaged ( AP) bacteria have not been compared under the same experimental conditions.	"AP	181	183	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 181, ""end_span"": 183, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
For example, AP bacteria grew better than WT bacteria in the presence of N - acetyl - neuraminic acid, and were more sensitive to four antimicrobials ( out of 373 screened in PM), including the calcium - specific metal chelator EGTA, the lipophilic chelator 5 - chloro - 7 - iodo - 8 - hydroxyquinoline, and the antibiotics tobramycin and cefotaxime ( Table 1).	"AP	13	15	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 15, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, when both bacterial variants were grown at 37degreesC in the enriched Todd Hewitt broth medium, their growth rates were indistinguishable, and the only detectable difference was that AP bacteria were more buoyant in liquid culture compared to WT.	"AP	192	194	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 192, ""end_span"": 194, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This difference in buoyancy can be attributed to differences in proteolytic activity ( WT > > AP) that may degrade many surface proteins, including pilin, or induce changes in the surface charge making bacterial aggregates more compact.	"AP	94	96	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The difference in buoyancy can also be attributed to differences in the expression of hyaluronic acid capsule ( AP > WT).	"AP	112	114	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Although the PM results confirm previous experiments [ 16] showing a few minor differences between WT and AP bacteria in vitro, this technology is limited because it uses minimal media and measures microbial respiration as a growth indicator ( http: / / www. biolog. com).

Several studies, including ours, have examined phenotypic, proteomic, and transcriptional differences between WT and animal - passaged M1T1 GAS strains [ For example, 11, 12, 13, 16, 26, 27, 37], but none attempted to capture the dynamic changes in the bacterial population in vivo.

While the expression patterns in clusters CC4, CC5, CC8, and CC9 match the previously described in vitro differences between WT and AP strains [ 10], [ 12], [ 13], [ 26], [ 27] ( e. g., downregulation of SpeB, CAMP, and EndoS genes; upregulation of SpeA, SIC, and capsule genes), the combined comparative analysis of in vitro and in vivo samples revealed novel expression patterns exemplified by CC6 and CC10.	"AP	132	134	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These two clusters include genes whose expression has been repressed ( CC6) or induced ( CC10) by the AP mutation, but the repression or induction becomes observable only in vivo.	"AP	102	104	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
For example, the expression of genes in the SLS and Trx operons is induced in vivo only in WT bacteria, but is mostly repressed in AP bacteria ( Fig. 2, CC6) both in vitro and in vivo.	"AP	131	133	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Likewise, some genes are only induced in AP - vivo, including those encoding the toxin / enzyme streptokinase and a RofA / Nra - like transcriptional regulator ( Fig. 2, CC10).	"AP	41	43	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
At all significance cutoffs, the fewest observed transcriptional changes were those differentiating WT and AP bacteria in vitro compared to other pairs of conditions.	"AP	107	109	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Genes of these two chromosomal clusters are significantly downregulated in AP compared to WT bacteria, but significantly upregulated in WT - vivo relative to WT - vitro conditions ( Fig. 4, CC6).	"AP	75	77	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Of interest, among the genes of known function, 25% of those whose transcription was modulated as a consequence of the covS mutation are virulence - related and another 25% are related to carbohydrate metabolism pathways, which are connected to virulence in streptococci [ 44], [ 45], [ 46].	"streptococci	258	270	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""streptococci"", ""start_span"": 258, ""end_span"": 270, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
When we attempted to correlate the array results with known GAS regulons, some differentially expressed gene sets could be fitted into previously described regulatory networks while others did not belong to any such networks.	"GAS	60	63	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""GAS"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In fact, our in vivo data show that covR itself is downregulated in vivo in both WT and AP strains ( Fig. 2, CC2 and Table S1); however, the SLS operon is upregulated in vivo in WT bacteria, suggesting that its regulation is not solely modulated by CovRS.	"AP	88	90	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 88, ""end_span"": 90, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Most genes within the Trx locus are downregulated in AP GAS relative to WT, but upregulated in the WT bacteria in vivo ( Fig. 2, CC6 and Fig. 3) suggesting the possibility of CovS - dependent in vivo signaling.	"AP GAS	53	59	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""AP GAS"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Although a number of informative studies have compared gene and protein expression in virulent and hypervirulent GAS isolates [ 11], [ 12], [ 13], [ 16], [ 26], [ 27], [ 37], none have captured the transitional state that reflects the dynamics of the bacterial struggle to survive in a new host environment.	"GAS	113	116	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""GAS"", ""start_span"": 113, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Our subcutaneous chamber model of infection allowed us to sample the inoculated WT and AP bacteria at specific times post - infection, during their adaptation to their new environment, to determine how their interaction with the host affects their community structure and their transcriptional reprogramming.

In vitro, the growth of these two variants of the M1T1 bacteria was comparable and, although 137 ( 5. 9%) of their genes were differentially expressed ( Table 2), in vitro phenotypic screening revealed negligible differences ( Table 1).	"M1T1	50	54	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""M1T1"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This suggests that the majority of in vitro vs. in vivo differentially expressed genes between the WT and AP variants may be involved in niche adaptation.	"AP	106	108	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 108, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Indeed, several virulence genes were among the 137 in vitro differentially expressed genes between these two M1T1 variants.	"M1T1	109	113	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""M1T1"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Upregulated gene sets in AP vs. WT bacteria in vitro included Mga locus genes ( e. g., sic, emm, scp); hyaluronic acid capsule - encoding genes ( hasABC); and genes encoding the toxins SpeA, SclA, SLO, and the streptodornase Sda1 ( Fig. 2, Fig. S2, and Table 3).	"AP	25	27	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 27, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Besides metabolic gene sets involved in trehalose and ascorbate utilization, several known virulence factors were downregulated in AP bacteria, and these included the SpeB operon, GRAB, EndoS, and CAMP factor.	"AP	131	133	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
SpeB is a major virulence factor in GAS pathogenesis and its expression is regulated by different systems [ 40], [ 56], [ 57], [ 58], including the CovRS system [ 20], [ 53].	"GAS	36	39	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""GAS"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Their downregulation in AP is thus consistent with the hypothesis that this hypervirulent variant is adapted for deep infection.	"AP	24	26	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 24, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In vivo, both WT and AP bacteria downregulated a substantial number of their genes ( 127 genes in CC1 and CC2, Fig. 2 and Table S1), and upregulated many fewer ( 24 genes in CC3, Fig. 2 and Table S1).	"AP	21	23	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 23, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Many of the in vivo changes that both the WT and AP bacteria underwent are suggestive of major metabolic reprogramming associated with the transition from a saprophytic lifestyle in the carbohydrate - rich laboratory culture medium to a parasitic lifestyle in the vascularized and the anaerobic subcutaneous environments rich in peptides, amino acids, nucleotides, and different types of complex carbohydrates.	"AP	49	51	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 49, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Interestingly, what this study revealed is that some of the downstream regulatory effects of the covS mutation in AP bacteria are only manifested in vivo.	"AP	114	116	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
For example, several gene sets ( e. g., SLS genes, Trx - locus genes, L - ascorbate utilization genes) were upregulated in WT bacteria in vivo, but were mostly silenced in AP bacteria in vivo ( Fig. 2, CC6).	"AP	172	174	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 172, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
For example, the in vitro microarray results are consistent with our previous proteomic studies of the WT and AP secreted bacterial proteomes [ 12] as well as with other recently published studies of the in vitro transcriptome of closely related strains [ 13], [ 26], [ 27].	"AP	110	112	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Importantly, we did not base our analysis on single measurements of gene expression, nor did we focus on individual genes; rather, we used gene expression data from biological replicates to rule out biological variability ( especially between bacteria recovered from different mice) and to look for changes in gene clusters, operons, and pathways.	"mice	277	281	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 277, ""end_span"": 281, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We believe that this approach provided more confidence in the final assessment of which genes / pathways were expressed similarly or differentially in both WT and AP bacteria in vitro and in vivo.	"AP	163	165	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 163, ""end_span"": 165, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Having used multiple strategies and integrated the PM data with the in vitro and in vivo microarray data, we propose the following hypotheses about streptococcal niche adaptation and switch to hypervirulence: ( 1) Exposure to the in vivo environment perturbs a substantial number of GAS genes and regulatory networks.	"GAS	283	286	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""GAS"", ""start_span"": 283, ""end_span"": 286, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This has been demonstrated by the larger number of genes affected during in vivo adaptation of both M1T1 variants compared to those affected by the covS mutation ( Table 2).	"M1T1	100	104	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""M1T1"", ""start_span"": 100, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In fact, WT bacteria underwent the most dramatic in vivo transcriptional reprogramming ( Table 2); yet, they failed to survive since after five to seven days post - infection, they became extinct, and only AP bacteria could be isolated from the mice chambers [ 16].	"mice	245	249	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 245, ""end_span"": 249, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
( 2) The covS mutation in AP bacteria seems to be preferentially modulating virulence mechanisms, as about 25% of the known genes perturbed by the mutation belong to virulence subsystems ( Fig. 5) and many of the other perturbed genes are indirectly associated with virulence ( e. g., carbohydrate metabolism [ 66] and arginine utilization proteins [ 38]).	"AP	26	28	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 26, ""end_span"": 28, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, the degree of AP invasiveness might vary depending on the route of infection and animal model [ 15].	"AP	23	25	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 23, ""end_span"": 25, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
It is noteworthy that SpeB expression has a dominant effect, since even if secreted in low amounts by a minor subpopulation, this broad - spectrum protease would still be able to degrade, fully or partially, many GAS virulence proteins, including Sda1, thereby rendering the bacteria vulnerable to different effector mechanisms of the host ' s innate immune system including neutrophil killing [ 14], [ 67], [ 68].
