When the Salmonella bacteria were grown in static cultures to the exponential phase ( SPI1 - inducing condition), the invasiveness of SR1304 for both epithelial cell lines was reduced by about 3 - fold, compared to that of SL1344 ( Figure 1A and B).

Streptococcus suis ( S. suis) is considered an important zoonotic pathogen causing a variety of life - threatening infections that include meningitis, arthritis, septicaemia and even sudden death in pigs and humans [ 1], [ 2].

Since the first description of human infection in Denmark in 1968, SS2 seems to have developed some unknown machinery to behave much more invasively, which is supported by two recent large - scale outbreaks of human epidemics in China ( one had 25 cases with 14 deaths in Jiangsu in 1998, the second had 204 cases with 38 deaths in Sichuan in 2005) [ 4], [ 5].

It has been reported previously in Salmonella typhimurium that a loss of proper chemotaxis control through a cheB mutation, leads to a ' tumbly ' swimming phenotype and a strong reduction in the isolates ability to invade human epithelial HEP2 cells as well as a reduction in infectivity in a mouse ligated - loop model [ 31].

In contrast, more than 50% of the worms were killed within 24 h when cultured with any one of three isolates of P. aeruginosa, PA14, PAO1 and TB ( data not shown).

For example, three group 1A mutants TB0173s ( cheB2, p < 0. 001), TB4554s ( pilY1, p < 0. 001) and TB4380s ( colS, p < 0. 001) each required at least one additional day ( 4 days) in order to reach 50% killing ( data not shown).

In addition to TB4953s ( motB, p < 0. 0001) and TB0173s ( cheB2, p < 0. 001), that presented strongly reduced adherence, five other clones were significantly affected in their adherence to cells when compared to the parental TB isolate ( Figure S1 and Table 1).

Both cheB2 mutants, TB0173s and TB0173i, required at least one additional day, as compared to TB, to kill 50% of exposed nematodes.

The parental TB strain was able to move towards the attractant ( an increase of slightly more than half a log of bacteria over 45 min) and the TB0173s strain ( cheB2 mutant) was also capable of chemotaxis, even though much reduced as compared to TB ( Figure S4).

Lungs from infected mice challenged with the TB strain as well as the complemented TB0173sp2B2 strain had a pronounced polymorphonuclear neutrophil ( PMN) infiltration as well as strong peribronchiolar and perivascular inflammation ( Figure 5A).
