However, as shown in Figure 5B, the csrS genes of all clinically isolated severe invasive GAS had a deletion, a point mutation, or an insertion, thereby, resulting in the creation of translational stop codons ( NIH147, NIH226, NIH230, and NIH269) or in a mutation in the presumed kinase domain ( NIH200).	invasive GAS,81,93,Organism	NIH147,211,217,Organism	NIH226,219,225,Organism	NIH230,227,233,Organism	NIH269,239,245,Organism	NIH200,296,302,Organism	"[{""token"": ""invasive GAS"", ""start_span"": 81, ""end_span"": 93, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""NIH147"", ""start_span"": 211, ""end_span"": 217, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""NIH226"", ""start_span"": 219, ""end_span"": 225, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""NIH230"", ""start_span"": 227, ""end_span"": 233, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""NIH269"", ""start_span"": 239, ""end_span"": 245, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""NIH200"", ""start_span"": 296, ""end_span"": 302, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	train
During systemic mouse infection, Salmonella processes multiple environmental cues via more than 14 regulators We performed virulence assays on 83 regulators previously identified as required for Salmonella enteriditis virulence by one or more negative selection experiments in various hosts including calves, chickens, and mice [ 13], [ 21] - [ 23].	mouse,16,21,Organism	Salmonella,33,43,Organism	Salmonella enteriditis,195,217,Organism	calves,301,307,Organism	chickens,309,317,Organism	mice,323,327,Organism	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 16, ""end_span"": 21, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 33, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Salmonella enteriditis"", ""start_span"": 195, ""end_span"": 217, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""calves"", ""start_span"": 301, ""end_span"": 307, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""chickens"", ""start_span"": 309, ""end_span"": 317, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 323, ""end_span"": 327, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	train
OG1 and its derivatives have been successfully used over the past 20 years in various animal models, starting with the demonstration that it can cause caries in germ - free rats [ 7], and later to characterize factors important for E. faecalis virulence in a mouse model of peritonitis [ 13], a rabbit model of endophthalmitis [ 14], a rat model of endocarditis [ 15] and in a mouse urinary tract infection model [ 16].

Overall, we found 64 areas of divergence between the genomes that can be divided into 3 classes: an additional sequence present in OG1RF when compared with V583; a sequence replacement where a sequence in OG1RF differs from the sequence in V583; and the absence of a sequence from OG1RF when compared with V583.
