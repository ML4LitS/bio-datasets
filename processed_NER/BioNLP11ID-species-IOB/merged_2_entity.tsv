Together, our findings correlate perfectly with the in vivo data described above and suggest that the lack of ESAT - 6 specific T cell recognition for H37Ra, H37Ra:: fadE5, H37Ra:: rpsL, and SO2 is not caused by a loss of ESAT - 6 expression, but rather due to a failure of ( phoP dependent) ESAT - 6 secretion.

The observation that knocking - in the ESX - 1 region of H37Rv into H37Ra ( H37Ra:: RD1 - ppe68 - ko), and the resultant diploidy, did not improve the ESAT - 6 - specific T cell responses ( Figure 3B), further argues that PhoP - dependent ESAT - secretion might be regulated via a mechanism that lies outside the RD1 region.

We confirmed the trend that rv3614c was expressed much lower in H37Ra compared to H37Rv by qRT - PCR ( Figure 6), whereas expression of rv3614c in H37Ra:: phoP was restored to wild - type levels, suggesting that the rv3612c - rv3616c gene cluster is regulated by PhoP.

The identification of the amino acid change S219L in the predicted DNA binding region of the C - terminal effector domain of PhoP [ 15, 22] in H37Ra was therefore a particularly exciting finding that has the potential to explain part of the attenuation of the H37Ra strain and to elucidate the PhoP / PhoR associated complex regulatory network in M. tuberculosis.

Since in previous, independent studies it has been demonstrated that functions of the rv3614c - rv3616c ( espA) gene cluster were essential for the secretion of ESAT - 6 and CFP - 10 [ 27, 28], it is quite probable that the lack of ESAT - 6 - specific T cell responses observed for strains H37Ra and SO2 ( Figure 3) might be caused by the insufficient expression of rv3612c - rv3616c, which results from the lack of a fully functional PhoP in these strains.

As in previous DNA / DNA microarray analyses [ 10], and from inspection of the very recently released genome sequence of H37Ra, no significant differences in the ESX - 1 encoding region were found, the assumption that the observed lack of ESAT - 6 secretion in H37Ra may be caused by factors outside of the RD1 region is very plausible.
