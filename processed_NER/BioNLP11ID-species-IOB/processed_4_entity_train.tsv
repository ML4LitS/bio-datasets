To determine production of long ( major) and short ( minor) fimbriae in the fimR - mutant, western blotting was performed with a polyclonal anti - FimA or anti - Mfa1 antibody to compare fimbrial production in wild - type strain ( 33277), the fimR - mutant ( FRE), the fimA - mutant ( FAT) and the mfa1 - mutant ( MFAE).

Two of the most widely used attenuated strains in the history of tuberculosis research are Mycobacterium bovis BCG ( BCG) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra ( H37Ra), which both lost their virulence during in vitro serial passage.

Groups of C57BL / 6 mice were subcutaneously inoculated with H37Rv, H37Ra, or one of three recombinant H37Ra strains complemented with phoP, fadE5, or rpsL, respectively.

As shown in Figure 3, splenocytes from mice that were inoculated with H37Rv produced high amounts of IFN - gamma upon stimulation with ESAT - 6 or CFP - 10, whereas the responses of H37Ra, H37Ra:: fadE5, and H37Ra:: rpsL infected mice were extremely weak.

Most interestingly, about two thirds of these 44 genes were also found substantially lower expressed in H37Ra in comparison to H37Rv, when the transcriptional profiles of H37Ra and H37Rv cultures grown in various media were examined [ 12].

The csrS mutants from clinical severe invasive GAS isolates exhibited high mortality and disseminated infection with paucity of neutrophils, a characteristic pathology seen in human invasive GAS infection, in a mouse model.

As previous reports suggested that the GAS envelope peptidase ScpC ( also known as SpyCEP) degrades the CXC chemokines, such as human IL - 8, Groalpha, murine KC and MIP - 2 [ 17] - [ 19], we established a NIH230 mutant deficient with ScpC ( NIH230scpC) and analyzed the property in a PMN migration assay.

Although sequences of the slo gene and the scpC gene were identical among clinically isolated non - invasive and severe invasive GAS ( data not shown), Figure 5A shows that the slo and the scpC genes were expressed in the severe invasive GAS greater in extent than those in the non - invasive GAS.

To unravel how micro - environmental signals are processed and integrated into coordinated action, we constructed in - frame non - polar deletions of 83 regulators inferred to play a role in Salmonella enteriditis Typhimurium ( STM) virulence and tested them in three virulence assays ( intraperitoneal [ i. p.], and intragastric [ i. g.] infection in BALB / c mice, and persistence in 129X1 / SvJ mice).

More important, rv2623 was also shown to be up - regulated when the tubercle bacillus is internalized by human and mouse macrophages [ 10], [ 38] as well as in the lungs of mice with persistent M. tuberculosis infection [ 11].

On average, the mice challenged with Y. pestis DeltayitR - infected fleas, both those that developed disease and those that did not, received a higher cumulative number of bites from blocked fleas than the mice challenged with Y. pestis - infected fleas, but this difference was not statistically significant ( Fig. 5).
