For transcriptional profiling, we followed a cyclic, two - color design and performed 28 oligonucleotide microarray hybridization experiments representing technical and biological replicates of the four cell states under investigation: WT grown in vitro ( WT - vitro), WT grown in vivo ( WT - vivo), AP grown in vitro ( AP - vitro), and AP grown in vivo ( AP - vivo), Fig.	AP,300,302,Organism	AP,320,322,Organism	AP,337,339,Organism	AP,356,358,Organism	"[{""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 300, ""end_span"": 302, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 320, ""end_span"": 322, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 337, ""end_span"": 339, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 356, ""end_span"": 358, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
