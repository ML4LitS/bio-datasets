In a urinary tract infection model administering mixed equal inocula of V583 and OG1RF, OG1RF significantly outnumbered V583 in kidney with geometric means of 1. 3 x 104 CFU / gm for OG1RF versus 1. 9 x 102 CFU / gm for V583 ( P = 0. 0005); in urinary bladder homogenates, the geometric mean CFU / gm was 1. 7 x 103 for OG1RF versus 6. 6 x 101 for V583 ( P = 0. 003; Figure 7a).
