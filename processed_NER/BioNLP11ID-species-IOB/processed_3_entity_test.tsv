To study how Drosophila flies deal with infectious diseases in a natural context, we investigated the interactions between Drosophila and a newly identified entomopathogen, Pseudomonas entomophila.

We have isolated several Erwinia carotovora strains, such as Ecc15, for their capacity to persist in the Drosophila larval gut and to trigger a strong systemic immune response following oral infection [ 8].

Although not a pathogen to Drosophila, use of Ecc15 has been pivotal in revealing the ability of Drosophila to activate an adapted response to persistent microorganisms in the gut, including the induction of local immune responses.

Although hundreds of microbial genomes have been sequenced, only two E. faecalis genomes have been reported ( V583 as a clinical isolate [ 4] and Symbioflor 1 as a commensal isolate [ 5]), but only the V583 genome has been made publicly available.

Multilocus sequence typing ( MLST) showed that OG1RF is clonally distinct from V583 ( differs in six out of seven alleles of housekeeping genes) [ 11] and characterization of regions flanking transposon insertions in OG1RF suggested that approximately 10% of their sequences differed [ 12].

OG1RF carries two CRISPR elements: CRISPR1 ( between the OG1RF homologue of EF0672 and EF0673) and CRISPR2 ( between the OG1RF homologue of EF2062 and EF2063); CRISPR1 is linked to cas - like genes while CRISPR2 is not ( Figure 3).

The OG1RF iol operon appears to be closely related to ones described in Clostridium perfringens [ 44] and Lactobacillus casei [ 45].

Since we did not identify any remnants of the iol operon in V583, it would appear that at least two independent events at the same location differentiate OG1RF and V583, suggesting that it is a hot region for rearrangement.

By probing a microarray of the V583 genome and plasmids with OG1RF genomic DNA, we previously estimated that only 75% of V583 ORFs were also present in OG1RF [ 22].

When compared in the mouse peritonitis model, the LD50 values of V583 in different determinations were lower ( 4. 8 x 107 to 1. 1 x 108 colony forming units ( CFU) / ml) than the LD50 values of OG1RF ( 1. 2 x 108 to 4. 8 x 108 CFU / ml).

Sequence analysis of clinical isolate 5628 reveals intact speB and covR / S but mutation in ropB M1T1 GAS clinical isolate 5628 was found on screening to lack SpeB activity by azocasein assay.

The clinical isolate 5628 expressing a truncated RopB, as well as the allelic exchange mutant 5448R - also expressing the truncated RopB from 5628, showed reduced virulence compared to strains containing a full - length RopB.

For example an Deltahfq mutant derivative in the pathogen Salmonella enterica serovars Typhimurium ( Salmonella Typhimurium) was found to attenuate virulence in mice and was impaired in the invasion of non - phagocytic cells [ 20].

Identifying what proteins are actually regulated by Hfq and SmpB is an important step in understanding the impact of post - transcriptional gene regulation in Enterobacteria and more specifically how Hfq and SmpB control Salmonella gene expression at the post - transcriptional / translational level and the role that this may play in Salmonella pathogenesis.

The absence of smpB and hfq attenuated Salmonella virulence; mice infected with the DeltasmpB mutant strain died at 10 days post - infection while mice infected with the Deltahfq mutant strain were fully resistant to the infection.

The result for hfq transcriptional analysis is in general agreement with previous studies for Salmonella [ 10] and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [ 33] where approximately20% and approximately15% of all genes, respectively, were regulated by Hfq, but slightly higher than the number of Hfq - dependent genes reported for E. coli [ 27] and Vibrio cholerae [ 21], approximately6% each.

Unlike Photorhabdus, the genomes of Xenorhabdus bovienii and X. nematophila do not encode homologues of a dedicated type III secretion system [ 3], indicating that Xenorhabdus likely uses different effectors or secretion systems.

We showed that the SsrB regulatory palindrome is also present in the orthologous SSR - 3 island of the endosymbiont Sodalis glossinidius and that the palindrome evolved in Sodalis can act as a cis regulatory input function in Salmonella.

Among palindrome - containing promoters, the ssrA promoter is exceptional for two reasons: a lack of conservation between Salmonella and Sodalis, and the evolution of tandem palindromes in Salmonella.

Among the various GAS serotypes, the globally disseminated M1T1 clonal strain remains the most frequently isolated from cases of invasive and non - invasive infections [ 2], [ 3], and although disease severity partially depends on host genetic factors [ 4], [ 5], [ 6], M1T1 GAS possesses unique genomic features that contribute to its evolutionary fitness [ 7], [ 8], [ 9], [ 10].

To address these issues and improve our understanding of the gene regulatory impact of mutational and adaptive events contributing to the hypervirulent phenotype of M1T1 strains, we analyzed differences in growth requirements, transcriptome profiles, and regulatory circuits of the virulent ( WT) and hypervirulent ( AP) phenotypes of the M1T1 strain both in vitro and during initial in vivo infection.

Minimal media are not optimal for the expression of GAS proteins, which may explain why GAS failed to grow at many of the PM conditions ( Fig. S1) and why fewer phenotypic differences were observed between WT and AP bacteria than transcriptomic differences ( see below).

Taken together, these results demonstrate how the murine model has allowed us to finely dissect two classes of events affecting GAS sociomicrobiology: those related to reversible transcriptional adaptation and those irreversibly caused by the covS mutation in AP bacteria.
