A study utilizing a zebrafish intramuscular infection model with serotype M5 GAS showed that inactivation of RopB resulted in decreased virulence [ 30], whereas a study utilizing a murine intraperitoneal infection model with serotype M49 GAS showed that inactivation of RopB resulted in increased virulence [ 27].

The well characterized strain 5448 and its isogenic mutant 5448R -, containing the ropB allele from 5628, were further included to examine the effect of this allelic variation in a well - characterized virulent strain of GAS.

The two strains containing a truncated RopB ( 5628 and 5448R -) demonstrated similarly reduced virulence compared to the two strains containing a full - length RopB ( 5628R + and 5448) ( Fig. 4B), confirming that inactivation of RopB results in decreased virulence in systemic infection.
