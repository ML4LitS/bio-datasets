Interestingly, aprA mutants were able to survive to wild - type levels in immune - deficient Relish flies, indicating that the protease plays an important role in protection against the Drosophila immune response.

More recently, we isolated Pseudomonas entomophila, a Gram - negative natural bacterial pathogen of Drosophila, from flies in Guadeloupe [ 9].

Importantly, in contrast to Ecc15, P. entomophila is highly pathogenic for Drosophila as well as for species from a different insect order ( Lepidoptera).	"Ecc15	28	33	Organism"	"Drosophila	75	85	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Ecc15"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 33, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Drosophila"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 85, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Interestingly, both prtR mutants ( CL25 and CU1) displayed a secreted protein profile identical to the wild - type strain except for a marked decrease of AprA ( Figure 1C, lanes 4 and 5).	"CL25	35	39	Organism"	"CU1	44	47	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""CL25"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 39, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""CU1"", ""start_span"": 44, ""end_span"": 47, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We thus compared resistance to P. entomophila infection of flies that were previously either orally infected with Ecc15 ( to activate a local immune response) or pricked with Ecc15 ( to activate a systemic immune response).	"Ecc15	114	119	Organism"	"Ecc15	175	180	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Ecc15"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 119, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""Ecc15"", ""start_span"": 175, ""end_span"": 180, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Figure 5C shows that a prior infection with Ecc15 protected flies against a subsequent P. entomophila infection only when Ecc15 was administrated orally, indicating that the local, but not the systemic immune response, plays an important role in P. entomophila clearance.

Proteases, especially metalloproteases, are also known to contribute to virulence in some pathogenic bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. marcescens, and Bacillus thuringiensis [ 20, 21, 26].

Many pseudomonads and other bacteria express proteases similar to AprA but are not able to infect Drosophila by oral ingestion.

However, since functional flagella are a prerequisite for chi - phage infection, we sought to determine whether defects in LPS and OPG affect chi - phage infection directly or whether the observed selection results are primarily due to reduced flagellar expression.	"chi	58	61	Organism"	"chi	142	145	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""chi"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""chi"", ""start_span"": 142, ""end_span"": 145, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
An flhD mutant was used as a chi - phage - resistant control and, as expected, showed no sensitivity, whereas chi - phage multiplied rapidly in the presence of the wild - type strain ( Figure 5A).	"chi	29	32	Organism"	"chi	110	113	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""chi"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""chi"", ""start_span"": 110, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Both OPG and LPS mutants showed decreased sensitivity to chi - phage, and the decrease in sensitivity was eliminated by introducing DeltarcsF deletions, indicating that OPG and LPS are not directly required for chi - phage infection ( Figures 5B - D).	"chi	57	60	Organism"	"chi	211	214	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""chi"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""chi"", ""start_span"": 211, ""end_span"": 214, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We also observed that sensitivity to chi - phage was higher in rfaI mutants than rfaC mutants, indicating that chi - phage infectivity is directly related to the degree of flhDC expression ( Figures 4, 5B, and 5C).

Using the published DNA sequence of V583 as reference ( NC _ 004668), OG1RF shares 2, 474 ORFs as well as the 12 rRNA genes and 58 of 68 tRNA genes ( Table 1).

The 10 missing tRNA are localized in a region in V583 that has been replaced in OG1RF by a 49 kb region ( see below).

Some of the major insertions / deletions in the two genomes are shown in Figure 2, such as the absence of the pathogenicity island ( PAI) in OG1RF and the presence of an approximately 49 kb fragment unique to OG1RF.	"OG1RF	141	146	Organism"	"OG1RF	209	214	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""OG1RF"", ""start_span"": 141, ""end_span"": 146, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""OG1RF"", ""start_span"": 209, ""end_span"": 214, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In a more recent analysis of relationships between various E. faecalis strains, the 23. 9 kb region was not detected in 86% of the strains of the clonal complex ( CC) 2, 58% of the CC9 strains, nor in any of the CC8 strains [ 31].

Our analysis of this area in OG1RF revealed the presence of an additional 14. 8 kb fragment inserted between the corresponding EF1826 and EF1827 of OG1RF ( confirmed by PCR; results not shown).	"OG1RF	29	34	Organism"	"OG1RF	148	153	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""OG1RF"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 34, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""OG1RF"", ""start_span"": 148, ""end_span"": 153, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In OG1RF, this 14. 8 kb region contains two loci, a WxL locus ( described below) and a seven - gene locus that may encode a possible ABC transporter with similarity to one annotated in Pediococcus pentosaceus.

The B region of Ace contains five repeats in OG1RF, while it contains only four in V583 [ 20].

Apart from these three MSCRAMMs with B - repeat polymorphisms, we identified two unique MSCRAMM proteins in OG1RF: a homologue of EF0089 ( OG1RF _ 0063, which shares 48% similarity) and a homologue of EF1896 ( OG1RF _ 0039, which shares 75% similarity); both are located in the approximately 49 kb region unique to OG1RF described below ( Figure 1; Additional data file 1).	"OG1RF	108	113	Organism"	"OG1RF	139	144	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""OG1RF"", ""start_span"": 108, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""OG1RF"", ""start_span"": 139, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Recently, it was shown that the WxL domain attaches to the peptidoglycan on the cell surface [ 34] and one member of this WxL domain family, the homologue of EF2686 in OG1RF ( a probable internalin protein), was shown to be important for virulence in a mouse peritonitis model and is required for dissemination to the spleen and liver [ 35].	"OG1RF	168	173	Organism"	"mouse	253	258	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""OG1RF"", ""start_span"": 168, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 253, ""end_span"": 258, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
OG1RF shares five complete WxL loci with V583 ( EF0750 - 7, EF2682 - 6, EF2970 - 68, EF3181 - 8, and EF3248 - 53).	"OG1RF	0	5	Organism"	"V583	41	45	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""OG1RF"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""V583"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
For example, OG1RF _ 0213 shares 88% similarity with EF3188, while OG1RF _ 0224, OG1RF _ 0225, and OG1RF _ 0227 share 64 - 68% similarity with their V583 counterparts, EF3248, EF3250, and EF3252, respectively.

In OG1RF, the region that would encode the cps operon is only 59 bp in length and has no homology with V583.	"OG1RF	3	8	Organism"	"V583	103	107	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""OG1RF"", ""start_span"": 3, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""V583"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 107, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Thus, while V583 and OG1RF share much similarity between their surface components, there are unique differences that could potentially be important in affecting the behavior of the strains and might be useful for strain typing.	"V583	12	16	Organism"	"OG1RF	21	26	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""V583"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""OG1RF"", ""start_span"": 21, ""end_span"": 26, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
OG1RF lacks four two - component systems found in V583.	"OG1RF	0	5	Organism"	"V583	50	54	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""OG1RF"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""V583"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, an OG1RF - unique two - component system with high homology with the vanG locus was found at the location corresponding to the region between EF2860 and EF2861 in V583 ( Table 3).

However, OG1RF _ 0191 lacks an identifiable transmembrane domain that is important to the VanY function and it is likely, therefore, that this protein may be a soluble D, D - carboxypeptidase / transpeptidase as seen in Streptomyces [ 39] and Actinomadura [ 40], and thus may not be involved in peptidoglycan metabolism.

To survey E. faecalis, also a member of this order, for the presence of the iol operon, 48 isolates with different MLST and / or from various origins ( including OG1RF and V583) were tested for myo - inositol fermentation; 23 of 48 isolates were positive.

To verify that the iol genes are responsible for the fermentation of myo - inositol in OG1RF, transposon insertion mutants [ 9] in the iolB and iolG2 genes of OG1RF were tested.

An analysis of the G + C content of OG1RF unique regions revealed several loci with a lower G + C content than the 37. 8% average content of OG1RF.

One of these is an approximately 49 kb fragment with a G + C content of 32. 1% located between an rRNA operon and the homologue in OG1RF of EF1053, replacing 10 tRNA genes present in V583 ( Figure 1).

This fragment appears to be a patchwork composed of hypothetical genes, homologues of Tn916 - associated genes and homologues of genes from other Gram - positive organisms, including Listeria, E. faecium, staphylococci, or lactococci ( Additional data file 1).

In V583, the fourth gene of this operon ( corresponding to OG1RF _ 0148) is interrupted by phage 4 ( EF1896 - EF2043); in addition, EF1984 contains a premature stop codon not found in the corresponding gene in OG1RF ( OG1RF _ 0228).

The other ComDE homology is that with a two - component system unique to OG1RF ( OG1RF _ 0199 and OG1RF _ 0198, respectively) that lies on a 4, 706 bp unique fragment that maps between EF3114 and EF3115 in V583.

Intracellular survival and persistence of Salmonella requires a type III secretion system ( T3SS) encoded in a horizontally - acquired genomic island called Salmonella Pathogenicity Island - 2 ( SPI - 2) [ 9], [ 10].

Our focus was on SsrB because of its broad conservation among the pathogenic Salmonellae and its essentiality for animal infection, suggesting it coordinates fundamental aspects of Salmonella pathogenesis beyond the SPI - 2 genomic island.

The tsetse fly endosymbiont Sodalis glossinidius contains the Sodalis Symbiosis Region - 3 ( SSR - 3) that is similar in content and synteny with the S. enterica SPI - 2 locus [ 31].

To demonstrate a functional role for the palindrome identified in Sodalis, we engineered luciferase transcriptional reporters that either contained ( 7 ' - 4 - 7 ' ') or lacked ( X - X - X) the identified palindrome from the Sodalis SG1292 promoter ( ssaG ortholog) and transformed them into wild - type S.

Thus, in addition to supporting a pathogenic lifestyle within a host in Salmonella, it seems probable that this common promoter architecture may direct the activation of the SSR - 3 T3SS of S. glossinidius in its endosymbiotic relationship with the tsetse fly host, although we acknowledge this requires experimental validation.

To the contrary, high local conservation in the promoters evolved in Salmonella and Sodalis was the crux in defining the functional SsrB input among stochastic noise.

Having previously reported that M1T1 Streptococcus pyogenes become hypervirulent in mice due to selection of mutants in the covRS regulatory genes, we set out to dissect the impact of these mutations in vitro and in vivo from the impact of other adaptive events.

Whereas the overall mortality rate of GAS infections is less than 0. 1%, the mortality rate of invasive GAS infections, which have resurged in the past 30 years, mounts to 25% ( out of > 650, 000 new cases per year) [ 1].

Among these features is the ability of M1T1 bacteria to switch to a hypervirulent phenotype associated with invasive diseases in vivo [ 11], [ 12], [ 13], [ 14], a phenomenon that is not fully understood and whose specificity to the M1 serotype remains to be established [ 15].

CovRS is a two - component regulatory system, in which CovS transduces external signals [ 17], [ 18] to CovR, which in turn represses the transcription of several group A streptococcal ( GAS) virulence gene sets, including the capsule synthesis operon ( hasABC), the streptolysin S operon ( SLS or sagA - H), and the streptokinase gene ( ska) [ 19], [ 20].

Phenotype Microarrays show no major nutritional or metabolic differences between wild type and animal - passaged, hypervirulent M1T1 GAS We used Biolog ( R) Phenotype Microarrays ( PM) to screen 1900 different growth conditions, including a large set of different carbon and nitrogen sources, pH values and salt concentrations, as well as different concentrations of various antimicrobial agents ( Fig. S1), and found that both WT and AP GAS have similar growth requirements in vitro with minor differences.

In this study, we designed and performed in vivo passage experiments in which equal loads of in vitro - grown WT and AP bacteria were separately inoculated into murine subcutaneous chambers [ 16] and collected by needle aspiration after 24 h, a time sufficient for the bacteria to sense the host environment and transcriptionally respond to it, but not long enough to allow detectable restructuring of the bacterial community and selection of mutants.

This pathovivogram highlights the transcriptional patterns that distinguish WT from AP bacteria regardless of their growth habitat ( pathogram, Fig 2.

"This finding suggests that AP bacteria are somehow "" pre - adapted "" to invasiveness and, consequently, when injected into mice, they do not undergo much virulence - related changes as they already possess a thicker capsule, lack a functional SpeB, are equipped with surface virulence proteins, and secrete ready - to - use toxins, including the potent DNase, Sda1."
