While writing this article, the whole genome sequence of H37Ra became publicly available ( NC _ 009525), and comparison of the SNP data obtained from the H37Ra strain used in our laboratory ( Table S1) with the NC _ 009525 data, showed that some differences existed between the H37Ra strains, a phenomenon which was also previously observed for BCG [ 4] and H37Rv [ 17].

To shed light on the mystery of high virulence of the epidemic outbreak strains of SS2, our joint research group completed a comprehensive study of comparative genomics, decoding the whole genome sequences of two virulent SS2 strains ( 98HAH12 and 05ZYH33) isolated from Chinese infected patients [ 6].

When compared with OG1RF, transposon mutants [ 12] in the OG1RF equivalent of EF2045 ( encoding the comGB homologue) and in the OG1RF equivalent of EF1986 ( encoding the comGF homologue) showed similar levels of transformability by electroporation ( data not shown), implying that the difference in electroporation efficiency observed between OG1RF and V583 is not related to this locus.
