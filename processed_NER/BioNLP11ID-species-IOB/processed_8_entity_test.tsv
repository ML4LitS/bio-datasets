In a urinary tract infection model administering mixed equal inocula of V583 and OG1RF, OG1RF significantly outnumbered V583 in kidney with geometric means of 1. 3 x 104 CFU / gm for OG1RF versus 1. 9 x 102 CFU / gm for V583 ( P = 0. 0005); in urinary bladder homogenates, the geometric mean CFU / gm was 1. 7 x 103 for OG1RF versus 6. 6 x 101 for V583 ( P = 0. 003; Figure 7a).

Of the last five genes, four are divergent in only one strain ( hktE, fur, phoR and hisH, respectively in reference strains from serotypes 8, 2, 15 and 7), and the APL _ 0999 gene codes for a hypothetical protein that is divergent in serotype 2, 7 - 11 and 14 reference strains.
