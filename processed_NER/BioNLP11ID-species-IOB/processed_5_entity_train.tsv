While writing this article, the whole genome sequence of H37Ra became publicly available ( NC _ 009525), and comparison of the SNP data obtained from the H37Ra strain used in our laboratory ( Table S1) with the NC _ 009525 data, showed that some differences existed between the H37Ra strains, a phenomenon which was also previously observed for BCG [ 4] and H37Rv [ 17].

As shown in Figure 7A, the NIH230 strain caused bacteremia in mice 24 h after intraperitoneal injection whereas the bacteremia was barely detected in mice infected with NIH230:: csrS + as well as the 1566 strain ( p = 0. 005 compared with non - invasive isolates, and p = 0. 005 compared with invasive isolates + CsrS).

Similarly, BfmR homologues were detected among proteobacteria including Yersinia sp., Burkholderia sp., Rhizobium sp., Vibrio sp, Geobacter sp., and M. xanthus with identities ranging between 50 - 92% ( Suppl. Table S3).

SeMac can cleave human IgG and inhibit the opsonophagocytosis of GAS by human PMNs, but it has limited enzymatic activity against horse IgG and is unable to inhibit opsonophagocytosis of S. equi by horse PMNs.
