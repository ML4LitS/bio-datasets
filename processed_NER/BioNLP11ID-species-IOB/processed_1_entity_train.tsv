However, once adhered, our data suggest that streptococci downregulate production of this cytotoxin, presumably to prevent further host tissue destruction that could interfere with adherence.

We created a spy0129 deletion mutant in strain SF370 ( SF370Deltaspy0129) to determine if genes contained within the spy0127 - 0130 cluster were directly involved in adherence to pharyngeal cells.

However, here we show that a point mutation ( S219L) in the predicted DNA binding region of the regulator PhoP is involved in the attenuation of H37Ra via a mechanism that impacts on the secretion of the major T cell antigen ESAT - 6.

In spite of the great progress that has been made in the understanding of some basic features of its pathogenesis, tuberculosis remains a major threat to human life in most parts of the world.

The genetic lesions of BCG have recently been determined [ 2 - 4], revealing that the loss of region of difference 1 ( RD1), which encodes part of the ESX - 1 secretion system [ 5], was one of the key events in its attenuation.

"Another famous example of an attenuated strain is M. tuberculosis H37Ra ( "" a "" for avirulent) ( H37Ra)."	"H37Ra	66	71	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 66, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This strain was obtained in 1934 by serial passage of patient isolate M. tuberculosis H37 through media with different pHs [ 6] and since then has been widely used in many laboratories in the world.	"patient	54	61	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""patient"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In a previous study we have tried to reveal these determinants [ 8], but the methods employed only identified large genetic polymorphisms, associated with IS6110, which were not found to be responsible for the attenuation of H37Ra [ 8].	"H37Ra	225	230	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 225, ""end_span"": 230, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
H37Ra was also the subject of extensive micro - array based analyses, including whole genome comparative DNA / DNA analyses [ 10] and transcriptional studies [ 11, 12], which have identified some candidate genes that were consistently downregulated.	"H37Ra	0	5	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 5, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
As all these previous attempts have failed to identify the genetic basis for the attenuation, we subjected H37Ra to microarray - based DNA re - sequencing ( NimbleGen Systems).	"H37Ra	107	112	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 107, ""end_span"": 112, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This technique has previously permitted single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) of a PA - 824 drug resistant mutant strain of H37Rv to be detected [ 13].	"H37Rv	126	131	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""H37Rv"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
"This approach was combined with gene "" knock - in "" strategies, to complement selected lesions, that allowed recombinant H37Ra strains to be engineered, whose virulence and immunogenicity were then evaluated in in vitro, ex vivo and animal models."

This strategy led us to identify and characterize a point mutation in the phoP / phoR two - component regulatory system of H37Ra that has uncovered novel regulatory links, which impact on the secretion and T cell recognition of the major T cell antigens ESAT - 6 and CFP - 10.

Importantly, on inspection of the structure of the PhoP - ortholog from Bacillus subtilis, it was found that the equivalent residue Ser 207 is a main residue in the DNA - binding domain, helix alpha3 [ 15].

To evaluate the phenotypic effect of the different SNPs and to assess their potential contribution to the attenuation process, we undertook functional genomic analyses using knock - ins of H37Ra, as described previously [ 18].

Based on the known role of phoP in virulence [ 14], the H37Ra strain complemented with I36 ( H37Ra:: phoP) was accorded highest priority for further molecular characterization and functional analyses, whereas the two other recombinants ( H37Ra:: fadE5, H37Ra:: rpsL) served as controls.	"H37Ra	56	61	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Indeed, Steenken and colleagues originally selected the H37Ra mutants mainly on the basis of the changes in colony morphology [ 6].	"H37Ra	56	61	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
When H37Ra knock - ins were tested, important differences in their ex vivo growth characteristics were found.	"H37Ra	5	10	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 5, ""end_span"": 10, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Further assessment of the in vivo growth of different H37Ra knock - in strains was carried out by intravenous infection of severe combined immuno - deficient ( SCID) mice.	"H37Ra	54	59	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 59, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In contrast, no effects on the virulence were observed when H37Ra was complemented with fadE5 ( Figure 2) or rpsL ( unpublished data).	"H37Ra	60	65	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, as already observed in macrophages, integration of phoP did not restore levels of virulence to those of the reference strain H37Rv ( Figure 2).	"H37Rv	134	139	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""H37Rv"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
As PhoP fulfills important regulatory functions in M. tuberculosis [ 21, 22], it was of primary interest to identify and study potential effector molecules whose involvement in host pathogen interaction were influenced by the point mutation in phoP of H37Ra.

In contrast, splenocytes from H37Ra:: phoP inoculated mice showed very strong IFN - gamma production in response to incubation with ESAT - 6 and CFP - 10.	"mice	54	58	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

However, in H37Ra the presence of this cosmid could not increase the weak ESAT - 6 and CFP - 10 T cell responses ( Figure 3B) in the splenocyte IFN - gamma assay.	"H37Ra	12	17	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 12, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The western blot analysis presented in Figure 5 shows that the cell lysates of H37Ra and H37Ra:: rpsL contain large amounts of ESAT - 6, indicating that the antigen is properly expressed.

In contrast, from examination of the western blots of M. tuberculosis H37Ra:: phoP and H37Rv it is clear that a large portion of their ESAT - 6 protein is secreted into the culture filtrates.	"H37Rv	87	92	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""H37Rv"", ""start_span"": 87, ""end_span"": 92, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
They also indicate that it is not a lack of phoP expression that is causing the phoP - associated effects in H37Ra.	"H37Ra	109	114	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 114, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Finally, microarray - based trancriptome analysis using the wild - type versus a phoP ko mutant of H37Rv has provided an overview of the transcriptional regulation linked to PhoP [ 21].	"H37Rv	99	104	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""H37Rv"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This finding argues that the PhoP S219L mutation likely has a broad impact on gene regulation in H37Ra with effects similar to those seen for complete inactivation of phoP.	"H37Ra	97	102	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Among the genes expressed at low level in the phoP - ko strain and in H37Ra were several that are involved in lipid metabolism; for example, the polyketide synthases pks2 ( rv3825c) or the Pks - associated protein papA1 ( rv3824c).	"H37Ra	70	75	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Closer inspection of the data published in the corresponding supplemental materials showed that rv3612c - rv3616c were strongly downregulated in the H37Rv phoP ko mutant as well as in H37Ra [ 12, 21].	"H37Ra	184	189	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 184, ""end_span"": 189, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

Altogether, from these reports it seems plausible that the pleiotropic regulator PhoP is involved in the regulation of rv3612c - rv3616c expression and thereby influences ESAT - 6 secretion and virulence [ 16], but to unambiguously answer this question, virulence tests with recombinant H37Ra and / or phoP ko strains that express rv3616c - 3612c under a constitutive promoter or a tetracycline inducable expression system [ 39] will be needed.

Our results obtained for ESAT - 6 expression ( Figure 5) and the transcriptome data from Gao and colleagues [ 12] argue against direct downregulation of ESAT - 6 in H37Ra.	"H37Ra	165	170	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""H37Ra"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 170, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

Although NIH230slo lost the killing activity for PMN, migration of PMN in response to IL - 8 in a transwell system was not restored in the presence of this mutant ( Figure 4A), thereby, suggesting that severe invasive GAS blocks PMN migration by influence on IL - 8 activity.

Previous studies using animal - passaged GAS have shown that mutations in both csrS and csrR gene are important for the invasive phenotype [ 5], [ 6], and mutation frequency of csrS and csrR seems to be the same [ 21].	"GAS	41	44	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""GAS"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Furthermore, the expression of some human invasive disease - associated genes [ 5] including slo was enhanced in the csrS mutant ( Figure 5B), but not in the csrR mutant [ 20].	"human	36	41	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 41, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This dominant role of CsrS is the first important observation in this study, and its mutation is possibly more important than that of csrR in terms of etiopathogenesis of human severe invasive diseases.

Numbers of studies has pointed out virulent factors to evade host defense using genetically - manipulated GAS and animal models [ 18], [ 22], [ 23], although the significance of each factor to invasive infection is diverse and sometimes controversial, perhaps due to lack of proper non - invasive counterpart.

DNase activity of the emm49 severe invasive GAS was lower than that of non - invasive GAS ( Figure S1B), possibly due to the difference of emm type.	"non - invasive GAS	71	89	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""non - invasive GAS"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Therefore, the second important observation in the present study is that an essential requirement of csrS mutation for invasive infection is associated with increased expression of ScpC and SLO and in vitro evasion of PMN functions, though we do not exclude the possibility that other CsrS - regulating factors contribute to the escape of invasive GAS from host defense.

A study has demonstrated SLO from invasive GAS lyse PMN [ 27], however this effect is likely due to complement activation by SLO [ 28] or PMN activation [ 29] but not due to cytotoxity of SLO itself as judged by their flow cytometry profiles which are distinct from ours ( Figure 2A).

PMN - binding GAS may make a small interface containing a high concentration of SLO between bacteria and PMN, which resembles to killing mechanism of killer cells to target cells [ 30].	"GAS	14	17	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""GAS"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Thus, these results suggest that the ability of incompetence for PMN functions by individual GAS strain may determine the induction and clinical outcome of invasive diseases.	"GAS	93	96	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""GAS"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

Low dose aerosol infection of outbred Hartley guinea pigs with approximately30 CFU revealed a clear growth advantage of the Deltarv2623 mutant strain relative to wildtype.	"guinea pigs	46	57	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""guinea pigs"", ""start_span"": 46, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
As early as 20 days post - infection, the number of M. tuberculosis bacilli present in the lungs of Deltarv2623 - infected guinea pigs was approximately10 - fold higher ( p < 0. 05) than those infected with wildtype Erdman, and continued to rise, attaining a 15 - fold ( p < 0. 001) difference by 60 days post - infection ( Figure 3A).

Moreover, Deltarv2623 - infected guinea pigs were moribund at 60 days post - infection, while those challenged with wildtype Erdman remained relatively healthy, providing further evidence that the mutant strain is hypervirulent in this model.	"Erdman	125	131	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Erdman"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Overall, the progression of pulmonic lesions was accelerated in Deltarv2623 - infected animals compared to those infected with wildtype Erdman, accompanied by more extensive necrosis and widespread fibrosis.

In fact, evidence exists that M. tuberculosis triggers an immune response in mice that is in excess of that required for controlling the infection [ 22], [ 23].	"mice	77	81	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 77, ""end_span"": 81, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Consequently, we examined the virulence of Deltarv2623 in the relatively susceptible C3H / HeJ mouse strain [ 24].	"C3H / HeJ mouse	85	100	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""C3H / HeJ mouse"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Manifestation of this hypervirulence phenotype is apparent as early as 3 weeks post - infection, with the lung bacterial burden of mice infected with Deltarv2623 M. tuberculosis approximately100 fold higher than that in the wildtype - infected animals.

Together, the animal studies provide strong evidence that Rv2623 regulates the growth of M. tuberculosis in vivo: in the absence of Rv2623, the tubercle bacillus fails to establish a chronic persistent infection, exhibiting a hypervirulent phenotype.

To examine whether the effects of overexpression of Rv2623 on M. smegmatis are operative in virulent M. tuberculosis, the growth kinetics of the Erdman strain overexpressing wildtype Rv2623, as well as the Rv2623G117A and the Rv2623D15E mutant proteins, were evaluated in vitro using the BACTEC 9000MB system ( Figure 8B).

We studied the M. tuberculosis USP rv2623 because it is one of the most highly induced genes in the dormancy regulon when bacilli are subjected to hypoxia and nitrosative stress [ 3], [ 4], [ 5], [ 36], [ 37].

Insufficiency of the chaperone - like alpha - crystallin encoded by M. tuberculosis hspX ( acr) has also been shown to be associated with hypervirulence in a BALB / c mouse model of tuberculosis [ 40].

Biofilm - associated microorganisms have been shown to colonize a wide variety of medical devices and have been implicated in over 80% of chronic inflammatory and infectious diseases including chronic otitis media, native valve endocarditis, gastrointestinal ulcers, urinary tract and middle ear infections, and chronic lung infections in cystic fibrosis ( CF) patients [ 1], [ 2].

Furthermore, the intracellular signaling molecule bis - ( 3 ' - 5 ') - cyclic diguanylic guanosine monophosphate ( cyclic - di - GMP), first described to control extracellular cellulose biosynthesis in Acetobacter xylinum [ 18], [ 19], has been demonstrated in several microorganisms to modulate biofilm formation via the production of exopolysaccharides or matrix components, control auto - aggregation of planktonic cells, and regulate swarming motility [ 20] - [ 32].

In Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, a T3SS encoded in a large genomic island ( SPI - 2) is required for intracellular infection, but the chaperone complement required for effector translocation by this system is not known.

Using a reverse genetics approach, we identified a multi - cargo secretion chaperone that is functionally integrated with the SPI - 2 - encoded T3SS and required for systemic infection in mice.

Comprised of over 20 proteins, T3SS are complex structures with relation to the flagellar T3SS [ 1], [ 2] and include several central features; ( i) inner and outer membrane ring structures, ( ii) an extracellular needle structure with pore - forming proteins at the distal tip that engage a host cell membrane, ( iii) an ATPase at the base of the apparatus with energetic and chaperone - effector recruitment roles, and ( iv) a suite of chaperones to coordinate the assembly and function of the apparatus during infection.

Much of the virulence potential of Salmonella enterica, a group of more than 2300 serotypes, is attributed to horizontally acquired genomic islands termed Salmonella Pathogenicity Islands ( SPI).	"Salmonella enterica	35	54	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Salmonella enterica"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 54, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
SPI - 1 encodes a T3SS required for host cell invasion and SPI - 2 encodes a second T3SS needed for intracellular survival and immune evasion [ 6], [ 7].	"host	36	40	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""host"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 40, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In addition to activating all of the T3SS structural operons, transcriptional profiling has uncovered new genes in the SsrB regulon that are required for bacterial pathogenesis including a translocated effector, SseL [ 19], [ 20], and a gene of unknown function called srfN that is common to the Salmonella genus [ 21].	"Salmonella	296	306	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 296, ""end_span"": 306, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These data reveal structural and biochemical insight into a T3SS secretion chaperone required for intracellular pathogenesis of Salmonella.	"Salmonella	128	138	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This gene was also down regulated in Salmonella mutants lacking the SsrA sensor kinase [ 20], and was predicted to encode a possible chaperone in a bioinformatics - based screen [ 23].

In whole cell lysates, SrcA protein was reduced approximately10 - fold in DeltassrB cells compared to wild type ( Fig. 1B) and the protein was not detected in the secreted fraction from wild type cells ( Fig. 1C), consistent with the expected properties of a T3SS chaperone.	"DeltassrB	74	83	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""DeltassrB"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In comparative genomics analyses, srcA was found in all virulent strains of Salmonella enterica containing SPI - 2, but was absent from the cold - blooded animal commensal, S. bongori, which lacks SPI - 2 ( Table S1).	"Salmonella enterica	76	95	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Salmonella enterica"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
If so, we reasoned that SrcA should contribute to animal colonization because the SPI - 2 T3SS is essential for host infection.	"host	112	116	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""host"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 116, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

This was shown for the flagellar T3SS [ 17] and later in the virulence - associated T3SS in E. coli [ 16], [ 27] and the SPI - 1 T3SS in Salmonella [ 15].	"Salmonella	137	147	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 137, ""end_span"": 147, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

The interface for the SrcA homodimer is extensive and is more in keeping with the structural features of single - effector class IA chaperones ( approximately1100 - 1300 A2) compared to the reduced dimer interface of Spa15, a multi - cargo class IB chaperone from Shigella [ 31].

Many important Y. pestis virulence factors that are required for plague in mammals have been identified, and most of them are induced by a temperature shift from < 26degreesC to 37degreesC, which mimics the transition from a flea to the warm - blooded host [ 1].

Of the 214 genes upregulated in the flea gut compared to all in vitro conditions, 78 are metabolic genes, 60 of which are involved in uptake and catabolism of amino acids and carbohydrates ( Table S1).

In particular, genes involved in transport and catabolism of the L - glutamate group of amino acids ( Gln, His, Arg, and Pro) were specifically upregulated in the flea ( Fig. 2).	"flea	163	167	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 163, ""end_span"": 167, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

The gabD gene functions to produce succinate from both GABA and hydroxyphenylacetate ( HPA), an aromatic degradation product of Tyr and Phe; and the HPA transport ( hpaX) and catabolism ( hpaCBIFHDE) genes of Y. pestis were also highly upregulated in the flea gut ( Table S1, Fig. 2).

As Y. pestis does not have homologs of genes required to produce GABA or HPA, these metabolites may be taken up from the flea digestive tract.	"flea	121	125	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 121, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The central role of the L - glutamate family of amino acids may also confer this advantage in the flea gut, because Glu and Pro are osmoprotectants.	"flea	98	102	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

In summary, Y. pestis appears to use amino acids, particularly the L - glutamate family, as primary carbon, nitrogen, and energy sources in the flea.	"flea	144	148	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 144, ""end_span"": 148, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Amino acid carbon is presumably funneled into the TCA cycle, the genes for which are highly expressed in the flea ( Table S3).	"flea	109	113	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 109, ""end_span"": 113, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

Several studies comparing the transcriptional profiles of Escherichia coli and other gram negative bacteria during biofilm and planktonic growth in vitro have been published [ 20], [ 21], [ 22], [ 23].	"Escherichia coli	58	74	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Escherichia coli"", ""start_span"": 58, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The transcriptional profile of Y. pestis in blocked fleas showed greater similarity to the transcriptional profile reported for E. coli in mature, four - day - old in vitro biofilms [ 23].	"fleas	52	57	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""fleas"", ""start_span"": 52, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In addition to yidE and cpxP, other Y. pestis predicted adhesins and components of an ESR were upregulated in the flea.	"flea	114	118	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Evidence for induction of an ESR in the flea included the high expression levels of rpoE, the gene for the alternate transcription factor sigmaE ( as well as the anti - sigmaE negative regulator genes rseA and rseB), cpxP; and pspA and pspG, components of the phage - shock protein ( Psp) response ( Tables S1 and S3).	"flea	40	44	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 44, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Because homologs of the yidE, cpxP, tibA ( yapL), cupA fimbriae, and pspABC genes were upregulated in the flea and have been shown to be involved in biofilm formation in other bacteria [ 23], [ 27], [ 28], [ 29], we made a series of Y. pestis strains containing deletions of these loci.	"flea	106	110	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 106, ""end_span"": 110, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, the single loss of any of these genes did not result in a noticeable defect in biofilm formation in vitro, or in flea infection or blockage ( data not shown).	"flea	122	126	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 126, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
A comparison of normalized gene expression levels from the two data sets provides insight into the biology of the flea - mammal life cycle.	"flea	114	118	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 114, ""end_span"": 118, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Several virulence factors were differentially regulated in the two hosts, but others were not ( Table 1).	"hosts	67	72	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""hosts"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 72, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The analysis also reinforces the model that Y. pestis produces a hexaacylated lipid A in the flea, and that the change to the less immunostimulatory tetraacylated form occurs only after transmission [ 32].	"flea	93	97	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 93, ""end_span"": 97, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Other virulence and transmission factors were not differentially regulated, including the hms genes; and the Y. pestis plasminogen activator ( pla), critical for dissemination from extravascular tissue at the fleabite site [ 33], and ymt were highly expressed in both hosts ( Table S3 and [ 11]).	"hosts	268	273	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""hosts"", ""start_span"": 268, ""end_span"": 273, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The Y. pestis outer surface protein gene yadB, recently shown to be required for dissemination and bubonic plague pathogenesis from a subcutaneous inoculation site [ 34], was significantly upregulated in both the flea and the bubo compared to in vitro conditions ( Tables 1, S1).	"flea	213	217	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 213, ""end_span"": 217, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Consistent with these findings, rovA expression was downregulated in the flea; whereas expression of rovM, a negative regulator of rovA [ 37], was upregulated.	"flea	73	77	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 73, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The transcriptional regulator gene phoP of the PhoPQ two - component regulatory system and the PhoP - regulated mgtC gene were expressed at levels > 2 - fold higher in fleas than in any other condition ( Tables 1, S1, S3).	"fleas	168	173	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""fleas"", ""start_span"": 168, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The Mg2 + concentration and pH of the flea digestive tract have not been defined, so the inducing stimulus is unknown, but CAMPs are induced and secreted into the gut by blood feeding insects when they take a blood meal containing bacteria [ 44], [ 45].	"flea	38	42	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 42, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Thus, the PhoPQ regulatory system may be induced by the flea ' s immune system in response to Y. pestis in the midgut.	"flea	56	60	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 60, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Induction of a phagocytosis - resistant phenotype in the flea	"flea	57	61	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Bacteria from fleas showed significantly lower levels of phagocytosis ( Fig. 4A).	"fleas	14	19	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""fleas"", ""start_span"": 14, ""end_span"": 19, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We have previously reported analogous findings using human polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( PMNs) [ 7].	"human	53	58	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 53, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The yit and yip genes in a Y. pestis locus ( y0181 - 0191) that encode predicted insecticidal - like toxins of the toxin complex ( Tc) family and three linked phage - related genes were upregulated 4 - to 50 - fold in the flea midgut ( Tables 1 and S1).	"flea	222	226	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 222, ""end_span"": 226, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, deletion of yitR or yitA - yipB ( y0183 - y0191) does not affect the ability of Y. pestis KIM6 + to infect or block fleas ( data not shown).	"fleas	125	130	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""fleas"", ""start_span"": 125, ""end_span"": 130, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These observations, and the fact that the Yersinia Tc proteins have toxicity to certain eukaryotic cell lines in vitro [ 50], [ 51], prompted us to investigate a possible post - transmission antiphagocytic role for these proteins in the mammalian host.	"host	247	251	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""host"", ""start_span"": 247, ""end_span"": 251, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
To determine if the insecticidal - like toxins were involved in resistance to phagocytosis, we repeated the macrophage experiments with a Y. pestis DeltayitR mutant, which as expected showed greatly reduced expression of the yit and yip genes in vitro and in the flea ( Fig. 4B).	"flea	263	267	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 263, ""end_span"": 267, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Loss of yitR significantly reduced the increased resistance to phagocytosis of Y. pestis isolated from infected fleas ( Fig. 4C).	"fleas	112	117	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""fleas"", ""start_span"": 112, ""end_span"": 117, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Since the yit and yip genes are not required for Y. pestis to produce a transmissible infection in fleas, it was possible to compare the virulence of wild - type and DeltayitR Y. pestis following transmission by fleabite.	"fleas	99	104	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""fleas"", ""start_span"": 99, ""end_span"": 104, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The incidence rate and time to disease onset were identical for both Y. pestis strains, demonstrating that expression of yit and yip is not essential for flea - borne transmission or disease ( data not shown).	"flea	154	158	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 154, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, it was not possible to detect any relatively minor difference in LD50 because the number of bacteria transmitted by a blocked flea varies widely [ 1], [ 52].	"flea	135	139	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 139, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Even a small decrease in LD50 provided by the Yit - Yip proteins would be significant at the ecological level in the maintenance of plague transmission cycles, because the transmission efficiency of blocked fleas is very low - often only a few or no bacterial cells are transmitted in an individual fleabite [ 52].

Does transit through the flea vector preadapt Y. pestis to resist mammalian innate immunity?	"flea	25	29	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 25, ""end_span"": 29, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
When Y. pestis is transmitted into the dermis by an infected flea, it is immediately exposed to the mammalian innate immune system.	"flea	61	65	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 61, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Our results indicate that Y. pestis entering the mammal from an infective flea is relatively resistant to macrophages, as well as PMNs [ 7]; a vector - specific phenotype that is not related to the T3SS or capsule.	"flea	74	78	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 74, ""end_span"": 78, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The upregulation of the innate immunity resistance genes phoP and mgtC suggest that those Y. pestis that are phagocytized may be prepared for resistance to CAMPs and intracellular survival while still in the flea vector.	"flea	208	212	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 208, ""end_span"": 212, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Finally, the major essential virulence factors yadBC and pla, essential for Y. pestis dissemination from the dermis, were maximally or very highly expressed in the flea ( Tables 1, S3).	"flea	164	168	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 168, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Besides degrading plasminogen, the Pla protease may also inactivate CAMPs, particularly when the F1 capsule is not present [ 57], which matches the phenotype of Y. pestis in the flea.	"flea	178	182	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 178, ""end_span"": 182, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In summary, Y. pestis appears to be prepared for pathogenesis in the mammal while still in the flea vector.	"flea	95	99	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""flea"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The biofilm phenotype of Y. pestis and the virulence factors upregulated or highly expressed in the flea may enhance the earliest stages of plague pathogenesis while the full complement of temperature - shift - regulated virulence factors is still being induced.

Background The two - component BvrR / BvrS system is essential for Brucella abortus virulence.	"Brucella abortus	67	83	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Brucella abortus"", ""start_span"": 67, ""end_span"": 83, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Finally, the expression of eleven genes which have been previously related with Brucella virulence was also altered.	"Brucella	80	88	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Brucella"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Conclusions / Significance All these data corroborate the impact of BvrR / BvrS on cell envelope modulation, confirm that this system controls the carbon and nitrogen metabolism, and suggest a cross - talk among some regulators to adjust the Brucella physiology to the shift expected to occur during the transit from the extracellular to the intracellular niche.

Facultative intracellular bacteria such as Brucella must survive in varied and changing conditions ranging from the open environment to the intracellular medium.	"Brucella	43	51	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Brucella"", ""start_span"": 43, ""end_span"": 51, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Up to now, BvrR / BvrS is the best characterized two - component regulatory system of Brucella [ 2] - [ 4].	"Brucella	86	94	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Brucella"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 94, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Although genome sequencing has revealed 21 putative two - component regulatory systems in the Brucella genus, the best characterized one implicated in virulence is the BvrR / BvrS system.	"Brucella	94	102	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Brucella"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
BvrR / bvrS mutants are avirulent in mice, have increased susceptibility to killing by nonimmune serum, show reduced invasiveness to epithelial cells and macrophages, and are incapable of inhibiting lysosome fusion and of intracellular replication [ 4].

To further understand the role of the BvrR / BvrS two - component signal transduction system, global gene expression profiles were analyzed by using ORFeome - based Brucella whole - genome DNA microarrays and confirmed by reverse transcription - PCR ( RT - PCR).	"Brucella	165	173	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Brucella"", ""start_span"": 165, ""end_span"": 173, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Brucella mutants in the BvrR / BvrS two - component regulatory system are pleiotropic [ 3] - [ 6].	"Brucella mutants	0	16	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Brucella mutants"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 16, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Whole - genome microarray analysis was made to determine the effect of the mutation in BvrR / BvrS in the gene expression pattern of Brucella.	"Brucella	133	141	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Brucella"", ""start_span"": 133, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The ORFeome - based Brucella whole - genome DNA microarray used in this study has been previously validated for the analysis of gene expression under any experimental conditions [ 7].

Data were normalized by the 2 - DeltaDeltaCt method [ 9] using the IF - 1 housekeeping gene of Brucella as reference ( Table 1).	"Brucella	95	103	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Brucella"", ""start_span"": 95, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In addition, proteomic analysis of Brucella outer membrane fragments demonstrated that the expression of several OMPs, lipoproteins and chaperones was altered in these mutants [ 6].	"Brucella	35	43	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Brucella"", ""start_span"": 35, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These data confirm that BvrR / BvrS regulates bacterial envelope changes that could modify surface properties relevant for Brucella virulence [ 6].	"Brucella	123	131	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Brucella"", ""start_span"": 123, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In addition, the complete maltose transport system of Brucella, which consists in a large operon containing thirteen genes ( BAB1 _ 0236 - 0248) was also affected.	"Brucella	54	62	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Brucella"", ""start_span"": 54, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Although it has been showed that the mutants in the BvrR / BvrS system have no obvious defects with regard to the ability to grow on standard media [ 4], our microarray results suggests that the BvrR / BvrS system controls elements directly involved in adjusting the Brucella metabolism to the nutrient shift expected to occur during the transit to the intracellular niche.	"Brucella	267	275	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Brucella"", ""start_span"": 267, ""end_span"": 275, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Since Brucella is an intracellular facultative pathogen, the bacteria could use these denitrification reactions to grow under low - oxygen condition by respiration of nitrate.	"Brucella	6	14	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Brucella"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Brucella may also take advantage of denitrification to cope with nitric oxide ( NO) production in the macrophage during the innate response against infection.	"Brucella	0	8	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Brucella"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In fact, some of these denitrification genes have been related with the virulence in mice [ 10], [ 11].	"mice	85	89	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mice"", ""start_span"": 85, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These results also demonstrated a connection between carbon and nitrogen metabolism and BvrR / BvrS in Brucella.	"Brucella	103	111	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Brucella"", ""start_span"": 103, ""end_span"": 111, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Our results also demonstrated that gene hpr - K ( BAB1 _ 2094), a member of the Brucella phosphotransferase system ( PTS; BAB1 _ 2097 - 2094) adjacent to the bvrR / bvrS, was down - regulated.	"Brucella	80	88	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Brucella"", ""start_span"": 80, ""end_span"": 88, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
[ 15] have suggested that in Brucella the PTS could interact with the BvrS sensor kinase, which in turn phosphorylates the response regulator.	"Brucella	29	37	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Brucella"", ""start_span"": 29, ""end_span"": 37, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
A link between carbon and nitrogen metabolism, PTS and two - component regulatory systems have been proposed for some bacteria [ 18], and our microarray results strongly suggest that same relationship could be made for Brucella.	"Brucella	219	227	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Brucella"", ""start_span"": 219, ""end_span"": 227, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Three of these, namely exoR, ompR and vjbR are down regulated and have been previously implicated in Brucella virulence.	"Brucella	101	109	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Brucella"", ""start_span"": 101, ""end_span"": 109, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

The two - regulatory systems ChvG ( ExoS) / ChvI in S. meliloti and A. tumefaciens posses a high level of identity with the Brucella BvrR / BvrS [ 25], [ 26].	"Brucella	124	132	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Brucella"", ""start_span"": 124, ""end_span"": 132, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
A. tumefaciens ChvI / ChvG system controls the expression of the Aop, an OMP homologous to Brucella Omp25a [ 28], and in S. meliloti, ExoS / ChvI is a key regulator of gene expression for exopolysaccharide synthesis, motility and nutrient utilization [ 26].	"Brucella	91	99	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Brucella"", ""start_span"": 91, ""end_span"": 99, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Based on all these findings, obvious comparison about the function of all these regulators in Brucella could be made.	"Brucella	94	102	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Brucella"", ""start_span"": 94, ""end_span"": 102, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
BvrR / bvrS mutants are unable to multiply intracellularly and are avirulent in the mouse model [ 4].	"mouse	84	89	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Although this general expression changes could explain the complete loss of virulence of these mutants, it was remarkable the presence among them of ten genes, in addition to bvrS, whose products are already known to be associated with Brucella virulence [ 10], [ 11], [ 33], [ 34].

B. melitensis malK mutant and B. suis aspB mutant were attenuated in cellular model of infection, and B. melitensis mutants in vjbR, motB, oppA, mosA and the hypothetical proteins BAB1 _ 0597, BAB1 _ 1717, BAB2 _ 1127 were attenuated in both cellular and mouse models of infection ( for a review see [ 33], [ 34]).	"mouse	255	260	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 255, ""end_span"": 260, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In addition, it has been demonstrated that some denitrification genes of the nor operon are required for Brucella virulence: norD in B. suis and norB in B. melitensis [ 10], [ 11].

Most of the genes candidate to be regulated by BvrR / BvrS identified in our microarray experiments can be involved with the changes needed for intracellular survival of Brucella.

In conclusion, all these results and previous findings support the proposal that BvrR / BvrS controls a significantly broad set of phenotypes and define an important and coordinate gateway between the free - living and intracellular states of Brucella.

This protein also has the endopeptidase activity against human immunoglobulin G ( IgG), and the Cys94, His262 and Asp284 are critical for the enzymatic activity.	"human	57	62	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 62, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
SeMac was characterized to determine whether SeMac has IgG endopeptidase activity and inhibits opsonophagocytosis of S. equi by horse PMNs.	"horse	128	133	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""horse"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 133, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

SeMac has endopeptidase activity against human IgG.	"human	41	46	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, the protein just cleaves a small fraction, which may be IgG1 only, of horse IgG.	"horse	79	84	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""horse"", ""start_span"": 79, ""end_span"": 84, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Thus, SeMac is a cysteine endopeptidase with a limited activity against horse IgG and must have other function.	"horse	72	77	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""horse"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
However, S. equi effectively evades the horse innate immunity by being resistant to phagocytosis by PMNs.	"horse	40	45	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""horse"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 45, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

S. equi has a homologue of GAS M1 Mac ( designated SeMac).	"GAS	27	30	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""GAS"", ""start_span"": 27, ""end_span"": 30, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
[ 16], resolved by SDS - PAGE, and probed by Western immunoblot with anti - SeMac mouse antisera.	"mouse	82	87	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""mouse"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 87, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
A catalytic triad of Cys94, His262, and Asp284 residues is critical for the enzymatic activity of GAS Mac [ 7, 8].	"GAS	98	101	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""GAS"", ""start_span"": 98, ""end_span"": 101, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
To determine whether SeMac also is a cysteine endopeptidase targeting IgG, Cys102 and His272 or Asp294 of SeMac were replaced with Ser and Ala, respectively, by site - directed mutagenesis, and wild - type and mutant ( SeMacCys102Ser, SeMacHis272Ala and SeMacAsp294Ala) SeMac proteins expressed in E. coli were tested for IgG endopeptidase activity using human IgG.	"human	355	360	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 355, ""end_span"": 360, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Wild - type SeMac cleaved the heavy chain of human IgG, while SeMacCys102Ser and SeMacHis272Ala completely lost the IgG endopeptidase activity, and SeMacAsp294Ala had dramatically lower enzymatic activity than the wild - type protein ( Fig. 4A).	"human	45	50	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The results indicate that SeMac is a cysteine endopeptidase, which uses Cys102, His272 and Asp294 as its catalytic triad to cleave human IgG.	"human	131	136	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 131, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
SeMac or GAS Mac cleaved a small portion of the IgG1 / IgG4 mixture, but not IgG4.	"GAS	9	12	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""GAS"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 12, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
SeMac does not Inhibit Opsonophagocytosis of S. equi by Horse PMN	"Horse	56	61	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Horse"", ""start_span"": 56, ""end_span"": 61, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
A whole blood based phagocytosis assay [ 13, 14] was used to test whether SeMac inhibits opsonophagocytosis of S. equi by horse PMNs.	"horse	122	127	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""horse"", ""start_span"": 122, ""end_span"": 127, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
But the inclusion of SeMac in the assay did not affect opsonophagocytosis of S. equi ( Fig. 5A), suggesting that SeMac does not inhibit opsonophagocytosis of S. equi by horse PMNs.	"horse	169	174	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""horse"", ""start_span"": 169, ""end_span"": 174, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
SeMac efficiently cleaves the heavy chain of human IgG.	"human	45	50	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""human"", ""start_span"": 45, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Thus, like GAS M1 Mac [ 7, 8], SeMac is a cysteine endopeptidase.	"GAS	11	14	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""GAS"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 14, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This lower hinge region is not well conserved in the seven subgroups of horse IgG [ 17] ( Table 1).	"horse	72	77	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""horse"", ""start_span"": 72, ""end_span"": 77, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These horse IgG antibodies that cannot be cleaved by SeMac thus still can mediate the opsonophagocytosis of S. equi.	"horse	6	11	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""horse"", ""start_span"": 6, ""end_span"": 11, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
SeMac and GAS M1 Mac show similar enzymatic specificity ( Fig. 4 and Table 1), confirming the previous finding [ 18].	"GAS	10	13	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""GAS"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 13, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Timoney et al. recently reported that IdeE / SeMac reduces the bactericidal activity of isolated equine PMNs for S. equi [ 19].	"equine	97	103	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""equine"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 103, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
SeMac is not produced in vitro, whereas GAS Mac is [ 16].	"GAS	40	43	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""GAS"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This suggestion is supported by only 29% DNA sequence identity between S. equi and M1 GAS in the upstream region of the semac and mac genes.	"GAS	86	89	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""GAS"", ""start_span"": 86, ""end_span"": 89, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
S. equi is a horse pathogen.	"horse	13	18	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""horse"", ""start_span"": 13, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
