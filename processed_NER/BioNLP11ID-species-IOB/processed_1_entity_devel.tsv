The Gram - negative bacterium Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, for example, experiences a number of acidic environments both inside and outside animal hosts.

During infection of a mammalian host, Salmonella is exposed to severe acidity in the stomach ( Rychlik and Barrow, 2005) and mild acidification in the endocytic vacuoles of intestinal epithelia and macrophages ( Brumell and Grinstein, 2004).	"Salmonella	38	48	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 38, ""end_span"": 48, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Moreover, Salmonella has been recovered from soil and water ( Winfield and Groisman, 2003) where the pH can be significantly low.	"Salmonella	10	20	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Previous studies have revealed that Salmonella responds to acidic challenges through an adaptive system called the acid tolerance response in which adaptation to mild acid conditions enables the organism to survive periods of severe acid stress ( Foster and Hall, 1990; Foster, 1995).	"Salmonella	36	46	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Growth of Salmonella in mild acid ( pH 5. 8) also promotes transcription of genes regulated by the response regulator PmrA ( Soncini and Groisman, 1996).	"Salmonella	10	20	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 10, ""end_span"": 20, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
The expression of these genes has been shown to be dispensable for the acid tolerance response ( Bearson et al., 1998) which suggests that there are still uncharacterized cellular function ( s) that Salmonella needs to regulate in acidic environments.	"Salmonella	199	209	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 199, ""end_span"": 209, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
While other PmrA - regulated genes have been identified ( Marchal et al., 2004; Tamayo et al., 2005), their biochemical activities and the role ( s) that they play in Salmonella ' s life remain unknown.	"Salmonella	167	177	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 167, ""end_span"": 177, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Mild acid pH induces transcription of PmrA - regulated genes To examine the mild acid pH induction of PmrA - activated genes, we grew Salmonella cells harbouring chromosomal lacZYA transcriptional fusions to the PmrA - regulated genes pbgP, pmrC and ugd ( Wosten and Groisman, 1999) in N - minimal media buffered at pH 5. 8 or 7. 7.	"Salmonella	134	144	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
To rule out this possibility, we treated the culture medium with Chelex 100 resin, an agent known to chelate polyvalent metal ions that does not affect Salmonella growth.	"Salmonella	152	162	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 152, ""end_span"": 162, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Expression of pbgP was still induced when Salmonella was grown in the Chelex - treated medium ( Fig. 2D) or in media containing the specific Fe3 + chelator deferoxamine mesylate ( data not shown) supporting the notion that mild acid pH is responsible for the observed induction.	"Salmonella	42	52	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
From these results we conclude that Salmonella harbours a signalling pathway that responds to mild acid pH by activating the PmrA protein through phosphorylation.	"Salmonella	36	46	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 36, ""end_span"": 46, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
To examine this hypothesis, we tested a Salmonella strain with a chromosomal pbgP - lac fusion, deleted for the chromosomal copy of the pmrB gene and harbouring a plasmid expressing a PmrB protein lacking its periplasmic domain for its ability to promote pbgP expression in response to different signals.	"Salmonella	40	50	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 40, ""end_span"": 50, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
While this mutation severely diminished the ability of Salmonella to respond to mild acid pH, there still was some residual pbgP expression ( Fig. 6B) suggesting that other residues might also be required for pH sensing.

We have established that the sensor kinase PmrB is the primary sensor that activates the PmrA protein when Salmonella experiences mild acid pH, resulting in transcription of PmrA - activated genes ( Fig. 1).

Although it has been suggested that the Salmonella PhoQ protein senses acid pH ( Aranda et al., 1992) or responds to both pH and Mg2 + ( Bearson et al., 1998), a direct role for PhoQ in responding to acid pH appears unlikely because not all PhoP - regulated genes are activated under these conditions, which is in contrast to low Mg2 + activating the whole PhoP regulon ( see Groisman and Mouslim, 2006 for a review).

Indeed, when grown at pH 5. 8 wild - type Salmonella were 100 000 - fold more resistant to polymyxin B than when grown at pH 7. 7 ( Fig. 7).	"Salmonella	42	52	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 42, ""end_span"": 52, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
On the other hand, although mild acid ( pH 6. 0) per se, i. e. even in the presence of high Mg2 +, promotes LPS modifications ( Gibbons et al., 2005), the low pH signal may also act synergistically with the low Mg2 + signal in vivo because Mg2 + deprivation alone is not sufficient to provide all the LPS modifications seen in Salmonella when present inside macrophages ( Gibbons et al., 2005).

A Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium mlc mutant showed reduced levels of invasion and cytotoxicity compared to the wild - type, and exhibited reduced expression levels of hilD, hilA and invF, which are regulatory genes in the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI1).

Based on these results, we propose that Mlc functions to sense the availability of sugars and is linked to virulence gene regulation by its ability to control hilE expression in Salmonella.

Since Salmonella is acquired usually by oral ingestion of contaminated materials, a key step in the infection process is passage across the intestinal epithelium by invasion of M cells in Peyer ' s patches ( 1).

Recently, Baxter and Jones ( 18) have shown that HilE is an important Salmonella - specific regulator of hilA expression.	"Salmonella	70	80	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 70, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
In the animal model, attenuation of virulence has been noted for Salmonella strains that carry mutations in the pts, crr, cya or crp genes, which encode the general energy - coupling enzymes of the PTS, enzyme IIAGlc of the PTS, adenylate cyclase and cyclic AMP receptor protein, respectively ( 23, 24).	"Salmonella	65	75	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

Mutation of the mlc gene reduces Salmonella invasiveness The process of invasion into non - phagocytic epithelial cells, which is known to be mediated by proteins secreted by the SPI1 - encoded type III machinery ( 3), is an important initial step in the pathogenesis of S.

We also observed reduced expression of the prgH and sigD genes, which are known to be regulated by HilA and InvF ( 10, 11, 29, 35), in SR1304 ( Figure 2B).	"SR1304	135	141	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""SR1304"", ""start_span"": 135, ""end_span"": 141, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
( 20) have found that HilE plays an important regulatory role in the expression of the Salmonella - invasive phenotype by affecting hilA transcription through direct interaction with HilD.

The role of HilE in the regulation of SPI1 gene expression by Mlc was further studied by comparing the invasive abilities of the hilE and hilE / mlc mutant strains of Salmonella.

We performed a primer extension assay of total RNA isolated from SL1344 grown to exponential phase in static culture, using the primer described by Baxter and Jones ( 18), to discover which promoter is regulated by Mlc.	"SL1344	65	71	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""SL1344"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 71, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
This difference could be attributed to differences in the experimental model conditions; in our study, total RNA from a Salmonella strain was used in the primer extension assay, whereas Baxter and Jones ( 18) used total RNA prepared from E. coli harboring the hilE reporter plasmid pMAB69.

The specificity of the Mlc effect was verified by complementation, as the plasmid pKB, which expresses mlc, restored the transcriptional level of hilE in SR1304 almost to that of the wild - type strain ( Figure 4B, lane 4).

On the other hand, the expression in SR1304 of both hilE and hilD was increased in the presence of glucose, mannose or arabinose.	"SR1304	37	43	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""SR1304"", ""start_span"": 37, ""end_span"": 43, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"

Collectively, these results show that SPI1 is not activated when Salmonella is grown in the presence of glucose ( Figure 6; 44, 45, 48).	"Salmonella	65	75	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""Salmonella"", ""start_span"": 65, ""end_span"": 75, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Since the environmental conditions faced by Salmonella change constantly during passage through the intestine of the animal host, this bacterium should use multiple signals to modulate the virulence genes needed for survival.

During the past decades, a series of virulence determinants of SS2 involved in the survival, spread and pathopoiesis of the bacterium within the host have been identified, such as capsule polysaccharide ( CPS), muramidase - related protein ( MRP), suilysin, etc.	"SS2	63	66	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""SS2"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 66, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Suilysin, a known virulence factor, was believed to be introduced into SS2 via lateral gene transfer [ 43].	"SS2	71	74	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""SS2"", ""start_span"": 71, ""end_span"": 74, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Moreover, PCR analysis using primers amplifying the salKR locus also demonstrated that this TCSTS is specific to Chinese epidemic outbreak strains of SS2 ( data not shown), implying its tight linkage to the virulence of this new emerging pathogenic species.

Results of piglets experimental infections clearly showed that the deletion of salKR leads to elimination of the lethality of this important pathogen.	"piglets	11	18	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""piglets"", ""start_span"": 11, ""end_span"": 18, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Colonization analysis also revealed the incapability of the DeltasalKR mutant to colonize any susceptible tissue of piglets when administered alone.	"piglets	116	123	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""piglets"", ""start_span"": 116, ""end_span"": 123, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
These results indicate definitely that SalK / SalR plays a critical role in the pathogenicity of SS2.	"SS2	97	100	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""SS2"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
We consider that the partial complementation observed in the piglets infection model is inherent to the pleiotropic role of this regulatory system which makes it difficult to restore the fine tuning of gene expression as in the wild - type strain.

It seems that SalK / SalR may control the full virulence of SS2 by regulating distant gene expression at the genome - wide level.	"SS2	60	63	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""SS2"", ""start_span"": 60, ""end_span"": 63, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
Secondly, some of the TCSTSs of S. pneumoniae were suggested to be involved in key processes of pathogenesis, such as autolysis and cell - cell signaling [ 52], SalK / SalR might regulate similar processes in Chinese SS2 virulent isolates.	"SS2	217	220	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""SS2"", ""start_span"": 217, ""end_span"": 220, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
More importantly, accumulated evidence suggests that some of the known virulent factors are not requisite for the full virulence of SS2, as the absence of one or more of these proteins in isolates from infected animals cannot necessarily be associated with a lack of virulence [ 53] - [ 56].

In conclusion, a unique two - component regulatory system SalK / SalR has been identified from a putative 89K PAI in Chinese isolates of highly pathogenic SS2.	"SS2	155	158	Organism"	"[{""token"": ""SS2"", ""start_span"": 155, ""end_span"": 158, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"
