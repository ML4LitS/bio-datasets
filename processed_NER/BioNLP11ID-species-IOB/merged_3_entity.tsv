However, as previously observed in complementation studies of BCG [ 18], the level of virulence displayed by the phoP complemented H37Ra strain was still substantially below that of wild - type H37Rv, arguing that the strong attenuation of the H37Ra strain is likely based on several different genetic lesions, such as the one responsible for the absence of phthiocerol dimycocerosates ( PDIM) [ 29], that were probably introduced into this strain during years of continued culture following the original event of attenuation described by Steenken et al. in 1934 [ 6].

Identifying what proteins are actually regulated by Hfq and SmpB is an important step in understanding the impact of post - transcriptional gene regulation in Enterobacteria and more specifically how Hfq and SmpB control Salmonella gene expression at the post - transcriptional / translational level and the role that this may play in Salmonella pathogenesis.

The absence of smpB and hfq attenuated Salmonella virulence; mice infected with the DeltasmpB mutant strain died at 10 days post - infection while mice infected with the Deltahfq mutant strain were fully resistant to the infection.

The result for hfq transcriptional analysis is in general agreement with previous studies for Salmonella [ 10] and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [ 33] where approximately20% and approximately15% of all genes, respectively, were regulated by Hfq, but slightly higher than the number of Hfq - dependent genes reported for E. coli [ 27] and Vibrio cholerae [ 21], approximately6% each.

Unlike Photorhabdus, the genomes of Xenorhabdus bovienii and X. nematophila do not encode homologues of a dedicated type III secretion system [ 3], indicating that Xenorhabdus likely uses different effectors or secretion systems.

Some genes might also be present in the genome of strain 896 - 07 and absent in reference strain L20, and therefore absent on AppChip2.	896 - 07,57,65,Organism	L20,97,100,Organism	AppChip2,126,134,Organism	"[{""token"": ""896 - 07"", ""start_span"": 57, ""end_span"": 65, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""L20"", ""start_span"": 97, ""end_span"": 100, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""AppChip2"", ""start_span"": 126, ""end_span"": 134, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
In the Salmonella genus, the SPI - 2 genomic island is found only in pathogenic serotypes of Salmonella enterica that infect warm - blooded animals and is absent from Salmonella bongori, which colonizes cold - blooded animals [ 18].

We showed that the SsrB regulatory palindrome is also present in the orthologous SSR - 3 island of the endosymbiont Sodalis glossinidius and that the palindrome evolved in Sodalis can act as a cis regulatory input function in Salmonella.

Among palindrome - containing promoters, the ssrA promoter is exceptional for two reasons: a lack of conservation between Salmonella and Sodalis, and the evolution of tandem palindromes in Salmonella.

Among the various GAS serotypes, the globally disseminated M1T1 clonal strain remains the most frequently isolated from cases of invasive and non - invasive infections [ 2], [ 3], and although disease severity partially depends on host genetic factors [ 4], [ 5], [ 6], M1T1 GAS possesses unique genomic features that contribute to its evolutionary fitness [ 7], [ 8], [ 9], [ 10].

To address these issues and improve our understanding of the gene regulatory impact of mutational and adaptive events contributing to the hypervirulent phenotype of M1T1 strains, we analyzed differences in growth requirements, transcriptome profiles, and regulatory circuits of the virulent ( WT) and hypervirulent ( AP) phenotypes of the M1T1 strain both in vitro and during initial in vivo infection.

Minimal media are not optimal for the expression of GAS proteins, which may explain why GAS failed to grow at many of the PM conditions ( Fig. S1) and why fewer phenotypic differences were observed between WT and AP bacteria than transcriptomic differences ( see below).

Taken together, these results demonstrate how the murine model has allowed us to finely dissect two classes of events affecting GAS sociomicrobiology: those related to reversible transcriptional adaptation and those irreversibly caused by the covS mutation in AP bacteria.	murine,50,56,Organism	GAS,128,131,Organism	AP,260,262,Organism	"[{""token"": ""murine"", ""start_span"": 50, ""end_span"": 56, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""GAS"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""Organism""}, {""token"": ""AP"", ""start_span"": 260, ""end_span"": 262, ""type"": ""Organism""}]"	test
