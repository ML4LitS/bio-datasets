"cDNA	4	8	gene"	"[{""token"": ""cDNA"", ""start_span"": 4, ""end_span"": 8, ""type"": ""gene""}]"
To address this limitation, a recently developed technique which couples the sorting of IgA - coated microbiota with 16S rRNA sequencing ( called IgA - seq) focuses analysis on microbiota identified by the immune system ( 19).	"16S rRNA	117	125	gene"	"[{""token"": ""16S rRNA"", ""start_span"": 117, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""gene""}]"
Using this schema, 121 of the 508 available samples were chosen for 16S rRNA gene sequencing ( S1 Table).	"16S rRNA	68	76	gene"	"[{""token"": ""16S rRNA"", ""start_span"": 68, ""end_span"": 76, ""type"": ""gene""}]"
Methods Subgingival plaque was collected from was collected periodontally healthy individuals ( 22 with and 19 without RA), and 16S gene sequenced on the Ilumina MiSeq platform.	"16S gene	128	136	gene"	"[{""token"": ""16S gene"", ""start_span"": 128, ""end_span"": 136, ""type"": ""gene""}]"
The full 16S rRNA gene was amplified from the extracted and purified DNA using universal bacterial primers 27F ( 5 - GTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG - 3) ( Felske and Weller 2004) and 1492R ( 5 - CGGCTACCTTGTTACGAC - 3) ( Lane 1991).	"16S rRNA	9	17	gene"	"[{""token"": ""16S rRNA"", ""start_span"": 9, ""end_span"": 17, ""type"": ""gene""}]"
Sequencing of the amplified V3V4 region libraries was performed using a MiSeq next - generation sequencer ( Illumina) with 2250 nt paired - end technology ( PE), using the v2 Illumina kit.	"V3V4	28	32	gene"	"[{""token"": ""V3V4"", ""start_span"": 28, ""end_span"": 32, ""type"": ""gene""}]"
Additional Information Accession codes: Sequence reads for the 16S - rRNA amplicon samples have been deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive ( SRA) under accession code SRR610826.	"16S - rRNA	63	73	gene"	"[{""token"": ""16S - rRNA"", ""start_span"": 63, ""end_span"": 73, ""type"": ""gene""}]"
16S and metagenomic libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform.	"16S	0	3	gene"	"[{""token"": ""16S"", ""start_span"": 0, ""end_span"": 3, ""type"": ""gene""}]"
