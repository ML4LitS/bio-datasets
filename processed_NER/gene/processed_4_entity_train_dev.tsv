16S rRNA gene tag sequencing and data analysis Purified DNA was submitted to the Josephine Bay Paul Center, Marine Biological Laboratory ( http: / / www. mbl. edu / jbpc /) for amplicon sequencing of archaeal and bacterial 16S rRNA genes with an Illumina MiSeq instrument with domain - specific primers targeting the V4 - V5 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene ( 518F - 926R for bacteria and 517F - 958R for archaea), following the methods described by Nelson et al. ( 2014).

16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing Partial 16S rRNA gene sequences were amplified from extracted DNA using primer pair Probio _ Uni and / Probio _ Rev, which targets the V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene sequence [ 16].

The results were correlated to the bacterial community by 454 - pyrosequencing targeting 16S rRNA gene and by T - RFLP analysis targeting genes of glycoside hydrolase families 5 ( cel5) and 48 ( cel48), combined with construction of clone libraries Results UniFrac principal coordinate analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplicons revealed a clustering of WWTPs, while the CDs were more separated from each other.

The PCR program used for amplification of cel5 and cel48 included initialisation at 95C for 5min, denaturation at 95C for 1min, annealing for 30s at 56C for cel48 ( 35 cycles) or at 52C for cel5 ( 45 cycles), elongation at 72C for 30s, followed by a final extension at 72C for 10min.
