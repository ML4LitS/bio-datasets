In order to analyse the relative abundance of the QQ enzymes in the water column, we applied the same sequence search for genes involved in the normal metabolism derived from marine bacteria, such as nitrogen ( amoC, amt), phosphate, ( pstA), sulfur ( dsrA, soxB), and general oxidative metabolism ( dmdA) [ 48, 80].

The analysis of other QS - related genes, such as those for AHL synthases ( LuxI, AinS, and HdtS) and AHL receptors ( LuxR and AinR) as well as the gene for the synthase responsible for producing the AI - 2 signal ( LuxS), was carried out by aligning the metagenomic reads against the NR database using DIAMOND [ 79] ( blastx option, top hit, 50% identity, 50% alignment length, e - value < 105).	"LuxI	76	80	gene"	"AinS	82	86	gene"	"HdtS	92	96	gene"	"LuxR	118	122	gene"	"AinR	127	131	gene"	"LuxS	216	220	gene"	"[{""token"": ""LuxI"", ""start_span"": 76, ""end_span"": 80, ""type"": ""gene""}, {""token"": ""AinS"", ""start_span"": 82, ""end_span"": 86, ""type"": ""gene""}, {""token"": ""HdtS"", ""start_span"": 92, ""end_span"": 96, ""type"": ""gene""}, {""token"": ""LuxR"", ""start_span"": 118, ""end_span"": 122, ""type"": ""gene""}, {""token"": ""AinR"", ""start_span"": 127, ""end_span"": 131, ""type"": ""gene""}, {""token"": ""LuxS"", ""start_span"": 216, ""end_span"": 220, ""type"": ""gene""}]"
Quantitative PCR to determine the tetracycline resistance genes Quantitative PCR ( qPCR) standards of tetracycline resistance genes ( tetW, tetQ, tetZ, and tetG) were prepared as described previously ( Al - Jassim et al. 2015).	"tetracycline resistance	34	57	gene"	"tetracycline resistance	102	125	gene"	"tetW	134	138	gene"	"tetQ	140	144	gene"	"tetZ	146	150	gene"	"tetG	156	160	gene"	"[{""token"": ""tetracycline resistance"", ""start_span"": 34, ""end_span"": 57, ""type"": ""gene""}, {""token"": ""tetracycline resistance"", ""start_span"": 102, ""end_span"": 125, ""type"": ""gene""}, {""token"": ""tetW"", ""start_span"": 134, ""end_span"": 138, ""type"": ""gene""}, {""token"": ""tetQ"", ""start_span"": 140, ""end_span"": 144, ""type"": ""gene""}, {""token"": ""tetZ"", ""start_span"": 146, ""end_span"": 150, ""type"": ""gene""}, {""token"": ""tetG"", ""start_span"": 156, ""end_span"": 160, ""type"": ""gene""}]"
