The 16S and 18S rRNA amplicons were prepared according to the Illumina 16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation guide [ 19] and as described previously [ 20].

For each DNA sample, we amplified respectively the bacterial 16S rRNA genes using a primer set specific for V3V5 hypervariable regions ( F357: 5 - TCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG - 3 and R937: 5 - TGTGCGGGCCCCCGTCAATT - 3) and the internal transcribed spacer ( ITS) using a primer set specific for fungal ITS1 rDNA region ( 18SF: 5 - GTAAAAGTCGTAACAAGGTTTC - 3 and 5. 8S1R: 5 - GTTCAAAGAYTCGATGATTCAC - 3) [ 62] containing adaptors, key sequence, and barcode sequences as described by the 454 Sequencing System Guidelines for Amplicon Experimental Design ( Roche, Basel, Switzerland).
