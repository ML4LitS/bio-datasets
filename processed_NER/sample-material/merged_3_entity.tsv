DNA Extraction, Amplification and 454 Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA Gene Amplicons Genomic DNA was extracted from known amounts of the granular sludge before ( i. e., inoculum granules) and after incubation with selenite ( i. e., selenite reducing granules) using the Power Soil DNA isolation kit ( MoBio, Inc.) as described in detail previously ( Gonzalez - Gil et al., 2015).	granular sludge,132,147,sample-material	inoculum granules,164,181,sample-material	selenite reducing granules,227,253,sample-material	"[{""token"": ""granular sludge"", ""start_span"": 132, ""end_span"": 147, ""type"": ""sample-material""}, {""token"": ""inoculum granules"", ""start_span"": 164, ""end_span"": 181, ""type"": ""sample-material""}, {""token"": ""selenite reducing granules"", ""start_span"": 227, ""end_span"": 253, ""type"": ""sample-material""}]"	train
The glacial moraine was not considered a polar desert soil as it comprised rock and soil debris from the foot of a glacier that has been transported by the glacier and its meltwater rather than weathered in situ from the bedrock.	polar desert soil,41,58,sample-material	rock,75,79,sample-material	soil debris,84,95,sample-material	"[{""token"": ""polar desert soil"", ""start_span"": 41, ""end_span"": 58, ""type"": ""sample-material""}, {""token"": ""rock"", ""start_span"": 75, ""end_span"": 79, ""type"": ""sample-material""}, {""token"": ""soil debris"", ""start_span"": 84, ""end_span"": 95, ""type"": ""sample-material""}]"	train
