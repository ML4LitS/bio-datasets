DNA extraction, PCR, sequencing and data analysis Biomass for DNA extraction was collected three times per week, both from the withdrawn reactor samples ( granular phase) and from the effluent ( suspended phase), at the end of the aerated phase.

On day 62 ( time point A) and day 177 ( time point B), all reactors were opened and the carbon substrate from the center of the reactors and the planktonic phase from between the wood chips were sampled.

Within 24h after admission, a nasopharyngeal aspirate ( NPA) was collected and parents from hospitalized children were asked for permission to collect a second NPA sample 46weeks after admission ( recovery).

A major feature of all deserts is the microbial communities that develop in soil as biological soil crusts ( BSC) or as cryptoendoliths within porous rocks such as sandstone ( Pointing and Belnap, 2012; Makhalanyane et al., 2015).

For comparison, we also collected one barite - rich silica chimney ( SiCh) from the extinct vent area ( Figure 1G) at 7333. 99N and 0809. 58E at a water depth of 2367 m. An overview of examined mat - samples and chimney sub - samples, respectively, are given in Table 1.

Establishment of light and heavy oil - degrading produced water cultures Oil - free produced water from all five PW samples was combined in equal ratios and 500 mL aliquots were dispensed into five sterile, custom - made glass vessels.

Incubation of pasteurized sediment slurries at 50C Triplicate slurries were prepared from 0 to 20cm surface sediment from each of the 111 locations in order to investigate thermospore germination and growth.
