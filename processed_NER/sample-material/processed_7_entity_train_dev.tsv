Sequencing of the microbiome When animals were individually caged for procedures, samples were collected both as stool and anal collections via cotton swabbing at several time points, including prior to the start of the synbiotic supplementation ( 1720months old, anus), midway through supplementation ( stool), and post - supplementation [ corresponding to one ( stool), two ( anus, stool), and 4months ( stool)] and during a HFD challenge that occurred 5months after treatment ( stool, 2628months old; Fig. 1, Additionalfile2: Table S1).

The list included three lake samples from Tibetan Plateau ( one water sample from NMC, two sediments from a KS sediment core, i. e., KS1 and KS2), one lake sediment from Beijing ( SSL), two marine sediments from Yellow Sea ( B43 and B46), one marine sediment from East China Sea ( DHa - 1), and one water sample from South China Sea ( DW03).
