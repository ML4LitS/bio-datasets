These digesters were all operating at mesophilic temperature ( range 3738C), six processing sludge from wastewater treatment plants ( WWTP0106) and four co - digesting various organic waste fractions ( CD0104), such as agricultural waste, source - separated organic municipal household waste and slaughterhouse waste ( Table1).

We adopted a zonal sampling approach where soils were retrieved that matched visible delineations along linear transects extending across the hyporheic zone from the waters edge at each sampling station: Zone ( 1) Saturated soil adjacent to waters edge; Zone ( 2) Wet soil as indicated by dark coloration; Zone ( 3) Ephemerally wet soil, dry but with evidence for previous water indicated by surface evaporites; Zone ( 4) Dry soil with no indication of recent moisture.
